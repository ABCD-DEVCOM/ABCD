<p>Introduction
<p>This handbook is designed to provide guidance on the approaches that can be adopted to
the development and management of reward systems that will contribute to improving
organizational, team and individual performance while respecting and catering for the needs
of employees.
<p>The book is evidence-based in that it makes use of the practical lessons learned from academic
research projects but also refers to the considerable number of reward surveys and case studies
produced over the last few years by e-reward together with surveys conducted by the Char-
tered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD).
<p>The theme of the book is that reward delivers performance. This is especially the case when a total
reward management philosophy is adopted: that is, an integrated approach to reward designed to
enhance engagement by responding to individual as well as organizational needs and making
appropriate use of both financial and non-financial rewards. It is in line with the main message of
the new performance and reward professional map produced by the CIPD. This spells out that
those involved in reward management are there to build a high-performance culture by delivering
programmes that recognize and reward critical skills, capabilities, experience and performance,
and ensure that reward systems are market based, equitable and cost effective.
<p>Plan of the book
<p>The book consists of the following parts:
<p>Part I: Essentials of reward management
<p>This provides an overview of what reward management is about and examines the three fun-
damental elements of reward management: the structure and elements of reward systems, the
concept of total rewards, and the contribution made by strategic reward management proc-
esses. This part also covers the special features of international reward policy and practice.

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>2 Introduction
<p>Part II: Performance and reward
<p>The aim of this part is to explore the relationship between performance and reward. It starts
with an examination of how performance management functions as part of the reward system
at individual, group and organizational levels and how it helps to create a performance culture.
On the grounds that engagement and discretionary effort contribute significantly to high per-
formance, Chapter 7 deals with how reward can enhance them. The following two chapters
examine the features of financial and non-financial rewards to provide a conceptual frame-
work for the next five chapters, which are concerned with describing contingent reward and
recognition schemes and how they impact on performance.
<p>Part III: Valuing and grading jobs
<p>This part deals with the factors affecting pay levels and fundamental processes of valuing jobs
and the characteristics of the grade and pay structures that are developed on the basis of the
outcomes of job evaluation and market pricing. It also deals with equal pay issues.
<p>Part IV: Rewarding special groups
<p>Consideration is given in this part to the reward requirements of the special groups of people
who are employed in organizations &ndash; directors, sales and customer service staff, knowledge
workers and manual workers. Reward practices may differ between these groups and the result
may be a degree of segmentation in the reward system.
<p>Part V: Employee benefit and pension schemes
<p>This part focuses on policies and practices in the provision of benefits and pensions and the
flexible benefit schemes that allow an element of choice to employees.
<p>Part VI: The practice of reward management
<p>The practice of reward management is a complex business covering the development, man-
agement and evaluation of reward systems and the allocation of responsibility for reward.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>The purpose of this introductory chapter is to set the scene for the rest of the book by explain-
ing what is meant by reward management, setting out its aims, summarizing how they can be
achieved and examining its underpinning concepts.
<p>Reward management defined
<p>Reward management is concerned with the strategies, policies and processes required to
ensure that the value of people and the contribution they make to achieving organizational,
departmental and team goals is recognized and rewarded. It is about the design, implementa-
tion and maintenance of reward systems (interrelated reward processes, practices and proce-
dures) that aim to satisfy the needs of both the organization and its stakeholders and to operate
fairly, equitably and consistently. These systems will include arrangements for assessing the
value of jobs through job evaluation and market pricing, the design and management of grade
and pay structures, performance management processes, schemes for rewarding and recogniz-
ing people according to their individual performance or contribution and/or team or organi-
zational performance, and the provision of employee benefits. Reward systems are described
in more detail in Chapter 2.
<p>It should be emphasized that reward management is not just about financial rewards, pay and
employee benefit. It is equally concerned with non-financial rewards such as recognition,
learning and development opportunities and increased job responsibility.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 7
<p>Characteristics of reward management
<p>Reward management is fundamentally about people. It is stakeholder orientated, integrated,
strategic and evidence based.
<p>Reward management and people
<p>Reward management is concerned with people &ndash; especially the employees who are rewarded
for their efforts, skills and contribution but also the directors, managers and reward specialists
who plan, manage and administrate rewards. This is in accordance with the view expressed by
Schneider (1987) that:
<p>organizations are the people in them:&hellip; people make the place. His point was that:
Attraction to an organization, selection by it, and attrition from it yield particular
kinds of persons in an organization. These people determine organizational behav-
iour&hellip; Positive job attitudes for workers in an organization can be expected when the
natural inclinations of the persons there are allowed to be reflected in their behaviours
by the kinds of processes and structures that have evolved there.
<p>A stakeholder approach
<p>The purpose of human resource management (HRM) is to meet the needs of all the stakehold-
ers in the business &ndash; employees, customers, suppliers and the public at large as well as manage-
ment and shareholders. Reward management shares that purpose. In doing so, it can make a
significant contribution to meeting the varied needs of stakeholders successfully. It is accord-
ingly concerned with improving business performance, shaping the behaviour of employees
and developing a climate of trust. And reward management can best do this if it is evidence-
based.
<p>But there is also an ethical dimension. Reward management policies in association with HR
policies can help to create a working environment that provides for the just, fair and ethical
treatment of employees. These are policies about treating people properly and avoiding the
creation of unacceptable reward practices that reflect badly on the organization. The bonus
schemes for top management operated in the banks and elsewhere in the financial services
sector are good examples of where reward policy and practice went wrong. They were against
the interests of every stakeholder except the recipients of the huge sums of money involved.
<p>Integrated reward management
<p>Integrated reward management is an approach to reward management that provides for
reward policies and practices to be treated as a coherent whole in which the parts contribute </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>8 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>in conjunction with one another to ensure that the contribution people make to achieving
organizational, departmental and team goals is recognized and rewarded. It consists of a
related set of activities that impinge and impact on all aspects of the business and the HRM
practices within it. As White (2005) points out, in an integrated approach &lsquo;each individual
element of reward supports the other to reinforce organizational objectives.&rsquo;
<p>Integration takes three forms:
<p>Strategic integration: the vertical integration of reward strategy with business strategy. &bull;
<p>HRM integration: the horizontal integration of reward strategies with other HR strate- &bull;
gies, especially those concerned with high performance, engagement, talent manage-
ment and learning and development.
<p>Reward integration: the internal integration of reward to ensure that its various aspects &bull;
cohere and that a total reward philosophy is adopted that means a full range of mutu-
ally supporting financial and non-financial rewards is used.
<p>The integrated approach adopted by Aegon UK is:
<p>Reward: market driven, with overall performance dictating rate of progress of salaries &bull;
within broad bands rather then existing grades.
<p>Recruitment: competency based, with multi-assessment processes as the basic approach. &bull;
<p>Performance management: not linked to pay, concentrated on personal development, &bull;
objective setting and competency development.
<p>Training and development: targeted on key competencies and emphasizing self- &bull;
development.
<p>Strategic reward management
<p>Strategic reward can be described as an attitude of mind &ndash; to be convinced of the virtue of sys-
tematically deciding what must be done and to believe in the need to plan ahead and make the
plans happen. In the words of Duncan Brown (2001) strategic reward &lsquo;is ultimately a way of
thinking that you can apply to any reward issue arising in your organization, to see how you
can create value. Its aim is to create reward processes which are based on beliefs about what
the organization values and wants to achieve. It does this by aligning reward practices with
both business goals and employee values.&rsquo; Strategic reward focuses on methods of achieving
vertical, horizontal and internal integration.
<p>Evidence-based reward management
<p>Evidence-based reward management is the management of reward systems on the basis of
fact rather than opinion, on understanding rather than assumptions, on grounded theory </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 9
<p>rather than dogma. This is in line with the views of the logical positivists (Ayer, 1959) that
it is necessary to seek &lsquo;analytical truths&rsquo; and that the fundamental question to ask when
examining beliefs is: &lsquo;How do you know what you think you know?&rsquo; It is also in accord with
Quine&rsquo;s (1970) opinion that beliefs can only be expressed in statements that &lsquo;face the tribu-
nal of experience&rsquo;.
<p>Use is made in evidence-based reward management of the extensive research conducted over
the last 50 years into how reward systems work in organizations and what can be done to
improve them. It subjects the theories derived from this research to critical evaluation on their
relevance and application in the context of particular organizations. Someone once said that
&lsquo;theory without practice is sterile, practice without theory is futile.&rsquo; But it should be remem-
bered that, as Douglas McGregor wrote in 1960, there is nothing as practical as a good theory:
that is, one substantiated by rigorous research within organizations that tells you how it is and
not how you think it is.
<p>Importantly, evidence-based reward management also makes use of the information obtained
from the detailed evaluation of the effectiveness and impact of existing reward practices and
from systematic benchmarking. It is concerned with establishing what constitutes good prac-
tice, although it does not assume that good practice is necessarily &lsquo;best practice&rsquo;. What works
well elsewhere will not necessarily work as well within the organization. In general, best fit is
more important than best practice.
<p>The reward management framework
<p>Reward management is a complex process with many interconnecting elements and under-
pinning concepts. The reward management framework expressed as a concept map is shown
in Figure 1.1.
<p>This model of reward is indeed complex but it can be analysed under the headings of aims,
strategic reward, contextual factors and reward concepts.
<p>Aims of reward management
<p>In the words of Ghoshal and Bartlett (1995) the overall aim of reward management should be
to &lsquo;add value to people&rsquo;. It is not just about attaching value to them. More specifically, the aims
are to:
<p>support the achievement of business goals through high performance; &bull;
<p>develop and support the organization&rsquo;s culture; &bull;
<p>define what is important in terms of behaviours and outcomes; &bull;</p>

<p>align reward practices with employee needs; &bull;
<p>help to attract and retain the high-quality people the organization needs; &bull;
<p>win the engagement of people. &bull;
<p>Overall and specific approaches to achieving these aims are described below.
<p>Achieving the aims in general
<p>The overall approach to achieving reward aims is based on a philosophy and takes into account
factors related to distributive and procedural justice, fairness, equity, consistency and trans-
parency. It is also concerned with achieving strategic alignment and cultural/contextual fit,
developing a high-performance culture and segmentation.
<p>Reward philosophy
<p>Reward management is based on a well-articulated philosophy &ndash; a set of beliefs and guiding
principles that are consistent with the values of the organization and help to enact them. The
philosophy recognizes that if HRM is about investing in human capital from which a reason-
able return is required, then it is proper to reward people differentially according to their con-
tribution (ie the return on investment they generate).
<p>The philosophy of reward management also recognizes that it must be strategic in the sense
that it addresses longer-term issues relating to how people should be valued for what they do
and what they achieve. Reward strategies and the processes that are required to implement
them have to flow from the business strategy.
<p>Reward management adopts a &lsquo;total rewards&rsquo; approach that emphasizes the importance of
considering all aspects of reward as a coherent whole that is linked to other HR initiatives
designed to win the engagement of employees and further their development. This requires
the integration of reward strategies with other HRM strategies, including talent management
and human resource development. Reward management is an integral part of an HRM
approach to managing people.
<p>Distributive justice
<p>As defined by Leventhal (1980), distributive justice refers to how rewards are provided to
people. They will feel that they have been treated justly if they believe that the rewards have </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>12 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>been distributed in accordance with the value of their contribution, that they receive what was
promised to them and that they get what they need.
<p>Procedural justice
<p>Procedural justice refers to the ways in which managerial decisions are made and reward poli-
cies are put into practice. The five factors that affect perceptions of procedural justice as iden-
tified by Tyler and Bies (1990) are:
<p>The viewpoint of employees is given proper consideration. &bull;
<p>Personal bias towards employees is suppressed. &bull;
<p>The criteria for decisions are applied consistently to all employees. &bull;
<p>Employees are provided with early feedback about the outcome of decisions. &bull;
<p>Employees are provided with adequate explanations of why decisions have been &bull;
made.
<p>Fairness
<p>A fair reward system is one that operates in accordance with the principles of distributive and
procedural justice. It also conforms to the &lsquo;felt-fair&rsquo; principle formulated by Eliot Jaques
(1961). This states that pay systems will be fair if they are felt to be fair. The assumptions
underpinning the theory are that:
<p>There is an unrecognized standard of fair payment for any level of work. &bull;
<p>Unconscious knowledge of the standard is shared among the population at work. &bull;
<p>Pay must match the level of work and the capacity of the individual to do it. &bull;
<p>People should not receive less pay than they deserve by comparison with their fellow &bull;
workers.
<p>This felt-fair principle has passed into the common language of those involved in reward man-
agement. It is sometimes used as the final arbiter of how a job should be graded (the so-called
&lsquo;felt-fair&rsquo; test), possibly overriding the conclusions reached by an analytical job evaluation
exercise. Such tests are in danger of simply reproducing existing prejudices about relative job
values.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 13
<p>Equity
<p>Equity is achieved when people are rewarded appropriately in relation to others within the
organization. Equitable reward processes ensure that relativities between jobs are measured as
objectively as possible and that equal pay is provided for work of equal value.
<p>Consistency
<p>A consistent approach to reward management means that decisions on pay do not vary arbi-
trarily &ndash; without due cause &ndash; between different people or at different times. They do not deviate
irrationally from what would generally be regarded as fair and equitable.
<p>Transparency
<p>Transparency exists when people understand how reward processes function and how they are
affected by them. The reasons for pay decisions are explained at the time they are made.
Employees have a voice in the development of reward policies and practices.
<p>Strategic alignment
<p>The strategic alignment of reward practices ensures that reward initiatives are planned by ref-
erence to the requirements of the business strategy and are designed to support the achieve-
ment of business goals.
<p>Contextual and culture fit
<p>The design of reward processes should be governed by the context (the characteristics of the
organization, its business strategy and the type of employees) and the organization&rsquo;s culture
(its values and behavioural norms). The design will be affected by the political and social
factors present in the organization.
<p>Account should be taken of good practice elsewhere, but this should not be regarded as best
practice (ie universally applicable).
<p>Performance and reward
<p>Reward strategies, policies and practices focus on performance and contribute to the achieve-
ment of a high-performance culture. This is one in which people are aware of the need to
perform well and behave accordingly in order to meet or exceed expectations. Employees will
be engaged with their jobs and the organization and be prepared to exercise productive discre-
tionary effort in getting their work done. Such a culture embraces a number of interrelated </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>14 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>processes that together make an impact on the performance of the organization through its
people in such areas as productivity, quality, levels of customer service, growth, profits and,
ultimately, in profit-making firms, the delivery of increased shareholder value. In our more
heavily service and knowledge-based economy, employees have become the most important
determinant of organizational success. The subject of performance and reward is dealt with
more thoroughly in Chapter 6.
<p>Segmentation
<p>Different segments of the workforce, and individuals at different stages in their career, will be
motivated by different combinations of rewards. A total rewards package should be tailored to
meet these different needs. Organizations may consider segmenting their package for different
types of jobs, or to reflect the different types and levels of contribution people make, or to
respond to different needs. For example, it is usually appropriate to have different reward
packages for sales and customer services staff because the nature of the sales or service role is
different from that of, say, administration.
<p>Achieving the specific aims
Support the achievement of business goals and high performance
<p>Reward management supports the achievement of business goals by helping to ensure that the
organization has the talented and engaged people it needs. It contributes to the achievement
of high performance by ensuring that the reward system recognizes and encourages it.
<p>Support and develop the organization&rsquo;s culture
<p>Reward management can support and help to change the organization&rsquo;s culture by:
<p>stressing the importance of high performance through contingent pay and performance &bull;
management;
<p>reinforcing the behaviours required in a high-performance culture; &bull;
<p>emphasizing that upholding core values is a major criterion when assessing performance; &bull;
<p>linking rewards specifically to behaviour that is in line with core values; &bull;
<p>demonstrating that the organization cares about the well-being of employees through &bull;
the provision of pensions and other benefits.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 15
<p>Define the right behaviours and outcomes
<p>Reward management can define expectations through performance management and contin-
gent pay schemes.
<p>Reward people according to the value they create and what the
organization values
<p>People are assessed according to the contribution they make to achieving organizational goals
and rewarded accordingly. Having defined expectations, reward management can provide for
people to be rewarded in line with the degree to which people meet them. Managers should be
aware of the results expected from people and the behaviour needed to achieve these results
and to support the organization&rsquo;s values. The reward system should ensure that the results and
behaviour are valued and recognized.
<p>Align reward practices with employee needs
<p>Employees need to be paid fairly for what they do, in line with the principles of distributive
and procedural justice and equity as defined above. Their needs for recognition can be directly
satisfied by the reward system and a total rewards approach will enable other needs such as
those for growth, responsibility and autonomy to be met. Segmentation of rewards may be
appropriate to reflect the different needs of employees.
<p>Help to attract and retain high-quality people
<p>Pay levels are important means of attracting people to organizations, although the employer&rsquo;s
reputation and the opportunities it provides for career development and scope to use skills
and abilities are also important. Decisions to remain with an organization are affected by
expectations on pay growth, feelings about the fairness of the reward system and comparisons
with what could be earned elsewhere. This is what labour economists call the &lsquo;sorting effect&rsquo;.
<p>Win the engagement of people
<p>Employee engagement takes place when people are interested in and positive, even excited,
about their jobs and are prepared to go the extra mile to get them done to the best of their
ability. A total rewards system (see Chapter 3) can win the engagement of people through a
mix of elements tailored to meet individual needs. These elements will include financial incen-
tives but also other forms of non-financial rewards in the form of recognition, scope for growth
and job design.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>16 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Factors influencing the achievement of the aims
<p>The achievement of the aims is influenced by the context and the reward strategy as affected
by the context. The aims of total reward management are also affected by the concepts of the
resource-based view, human capital management, human process advantage and HR process
advantage.
<p>Contextual factors
<p>Reward strategies and practices must take account of the internal and external context &ndash; the
concept of &lsquo;best fit&rsquo;.
<p>Internal context
<p>The characteristic features of the internal context are as follows.
<p>The organization&rsquo;s culture
<p>Organizational culture consists of shared values, norms and assumptions that influence the
way people act and the way things get done. In reward management, the most important
aspects of culture that need to be taken into account are the core values of the organization,
which express beliefs on what sort of behaviour is desirable. Reward practices should fit in
with and support the culture and they can help to reshape it.
<p>The organization&rsquo;s business or sector
<p>The business or sector of the organization, for example manufacturing, financial services,
retail services, transport, media, public sector services, not-for-profit services or education &ndash;
will govern its ethos and therefore its core values. It will influence the type of people it employs
and the degree to which it is subject to turbulence and change. All these factors will contribute
to the reward strategy.
<p>Work environment
<p>The ways in which work is organized, managed and carried out will influence pay structure
and the use of contingent pay. The introduction of new technology may result in consider-
able changes to systems and processes. Different skills are required, new methods of working
and therefore reward are developed. The result may be an extension of the skills base of the
organization and its employees, including multiskilling (ensuring that people have a range
of skills that enable them to work flexibly on a variety of tasks, often within a teamworking </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 17
<p>environment). Traditional piecework pay systems in manufacturing industry have been
replaced by higher fixed pay and rewards focused on quality and employee teamwork.
<p>People
<p>People&rsquo;s occupations may affect their wants and needs. Entrepreneurial directors or sales rep-
resentatives may be more interested in financial incentives than, say, people engaged in chari-
table work. Reward strategies and policies should take account of the different needs of people
and this may mean segmenting rewards to meet those individual needs.
<p>Business strategy
<p>Where the business is going &ndash; the business strategy &ndash; determines where reward should go &ndash; the
reward strategy. Integrating reward and business strategies means combining them as a whole
so they contribute effectively to achieving the mission or purpose of the organization.
<p>Political and social climate
<p>Organizational politics and social factors such as the way people interact will affect how the
organization functions and therefore what approach to reward management it adopts.
<p>External context
<p>The following aspects of the external context may affect reward management policies.
<p>Globalization
<p>Globalization requires organizations to move people, ideas, products and information around
the world to meet local needs. Traditionally, discussions of international reward strategies and
practices have tended to focus on an elite of expatriate workers, sourced from headquarter
locations and rewarded in isolation from local country staff. We are now seeing a more diverse
and complex pattern emerging, requiring a much more strategic approach as described in
Chapter 5.
<p>Rates of pay in the market place
<p>The external environment exerts a major influence on rates of pay and pay reviews within
organizations. Market or going-rate levels and movements have to be taken into account by
organizations if they want their pay to be competitive. Some organizations are affected by
national agreements with trade unions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>18 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>The economy
<p>The economy, whether it is in a boom or bust mode, will inevitably affect reward policy and
practice. A recession such as the one that began in 2008 increases the attention organizations
pay to getting value for money and reduces the amounts that can be distributed in the form of
base and contingent pay and the scale of benefits provision.
<p>Societal factors
<p>Views about reward held in society at large may affect internal reward policies. For example, the
opprobrium levelled in 2009 at &lsquo;fat cats&rsquo; in boardrooms and the bonus culture in the City may
possibly have some influence on members of remuneration committees. Again, it may not.
<p>UK employment legislation
<p>The following pieces of UK legislation directly or indirectly affect pay policies and practices:
<p>The Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations 1983 provide &bull;
that pay differences are allowable only if the reason for them is not related to the sex of
the job holder. The Employment Act 2002 provides for the use of equal pay question-
naires. Equal pay legislation is described in Chapter 17.
<p>The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 provides workers in the UK with a level of pay &bull;
below which their wages must not fall &ndash; regardless of where they live or work or the
sector or size of company in which they work. It is not a going rate. The government
prescribes by regulation the minimum wage.
<p>The Working Time Regulations 1998 provide, inter alia, for a limit of 48 hours on &bull;
average weekly working time, which an individual worker may voluntarily agree to
exceed, and a minimum of four week&rsquo;s paid annual leave subject to a 13-week qualify-
ing period.
<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 provides among other things that employees are entitled &bull;
to make a formal request to access information on the personal data held on them and
the uses to which this will be put.
<p>The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE) &bull;
provide that when a business or part of a business is transferred, the workers in that
business automatically transfer into the employment of the transferee together with
their existing terms and conditions of employment (except for pensions) intact and
with their accrued periods of continuous service.
<p>The Financial Services Act 1986 places restrictions on the provision of financial &bull;
advice to employees. Only those who are directly authorized by one of the regulatory </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 19
<p>organizations or professional bodies are permitted to give detailed financial advice
on investments.
<p>The trade unions
<p>Trade unions influence reward practices at national level through national pay negotiations,
pronouncements on such issues as the pay of top executives, and exerting pressure to achieve
equal pay. They produce policies and advice for their members on job evaluation (they are in
favour of analytical schemes while emphasizing the need for involvement in their design), pay
structures (they tend to be against broad-banded structures) and performance-related pay
(they are generally hostile to it, preferring the traditional service-related incremental scales).
<p>Fundamental concepts
<p>The following fundamental concepts influence the aims of reward management, reward strat-
egy and how people are valued.
<p>The resource-based view
<p>This is the view that it is the range of resources in an organization, including its human
resources, that produces its unique character and creates competitive advantage. HRM deliv-
ers added value and helps to achieve sustainable competitive advantage through the strategic
development of the organization&rsquo;s rare, hard to imitate and hard to substitute human resources.
Boxall (1999) refers to the situation in which people are employed with competitively valuable
knowledge and skills, as one that confers &lsquo;human capital advantage&rsquo;.
<p>The role of reward management is to contribute to the acquisition and retention of such
people.
<p>Human capital management
<p>The concept of human capital is often associated with the resource-based view. Chatzkel
(2004) observes that &lsquo;it is human capital that is the differentiator for organizations and the
actual basis for competitive advantage&rsquo;. Human capital management (HCM) is often described
as being about measurement in the sense of obtaining, analysing and reporting on data relat-
ing to employees that inform HRM decisions. But it is sometimes defined more broadly
without the emphasis on measurement. Chatzkel states that &lsquo;Human capital management is
an integrated effort to manage and develop human capabilities to achieve significantly higher
levels of performance.&rsquo; And Kearns (2005) refers to HCM as &lsquo;The total development of human </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>20 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>potential expressed as organizational value&rsquo;. He believes that &lsquo;HCM is about creating value
through people&rsquo; and this is a prime purpose of reward management.
<p>Human process advantage
<p>Boxall (1999) notes that a distinction should be made between &lsquo;human process advantage&rsquo; and
&lsquo;human capital advantage&rsquo;. The former results from the establishment of &lsquo;difficult to imitate,
highly evolved processes within the firm&rsquo;, while the latter follows from employing people with
competitively valuable knowledge and skills. This suggests that one of the roles of reward
management is to differentiate from rather than imitate the &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; of other firms.
<p>Motivation theory
<p>Motivation is the force that energizes, directs and sustains behaviour. Motivation theory
explains how motivation works and the factors that determine its strength. It deals with how
money and other types of rewards affect the motivation to work and levels of performance,
what creates job satisfaction, and the link between job satisfaction and performance. It there-
fore influences decisions on how people should be valued, the choice and design of financial
rewards and the use of non-financial rewards.
<p>A distinction is made between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation occurs
when things are done to or for people to motivate them. These include rewards, such as incen-
tives, increased pay, praise, or promotion, and punishments, such as disciplinary action, with-
holding pay, or criticism. Intrinsic motivation is provided by the work itself.
<p>There are four main categories of motivation theories as described below.
<p>Instrumentality theory
<p>&lsquo;Instrumentality&rsquo; is the belief that if we do one thing it will lead to another. In its crudest form,
instrumentality theory states that people only work for money. It assumes that people will be
motivated to work if rewards and penalties are tied directly to their performance; thus the
awards are contingent upon effective performance. Instrumentality theory has its roots in the
scientific management methods of Taylor (1911), who wrote: &lsquo;It is impossible, through any
long period of time, to get workmen to work much harder than the average men around them
unless they are assured a large and permanent increase in their pay.&rsquo;
<p>Content (needs) theory
<p>This theory focuses on the content of motivation in the shape of needs. It provides guidance
on what needs should be satisfied by the reward system if motivation is to occur. The basis of
content theory is the belief that an unsatisfied need creates tension and a state of disequilib-</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 21
<p>rium. To restore the balance a goal is identified that will satisfy the need, and a behaviour
pathway is selected that will lead to the achievement of the goal and the satisfaction of the
need. All behaviour is therefore motivated by unsatisfied needs. The main contributors to
needs theory were Alderfer (1972), McClelland (1961) and Maslow (1954). Herzberg (1968)
identified a number of &lsquo;satisfiers&rsquo;, which are in effect needs.
<p>The main needs identified by these and other writers are those for achievement, recognition,
responsibility, autonomy and the opportunity to develop and use skills. These have to be taken
into account in deciding how people should be rewarded and also in achieving motivation
through job design. But a note of caution is necessary. Content theories propose that to a large
extent all people strive for the same fundamental goals. In fact, people are more varied and
complex than this. Theories stating that there are strong similarities between people lead to
the conclusion that there is &lsquo;one best way&rsquo; to motivate and reward them, which is simply not
true. Process theory as described below is based on more realistic, albeit more complex ideas.
<p>Process theory
<p>In process theory, the focus is on the psychological processes or forces that affect motivation,
as well as on basic needs. The three main theories are:
<p>Expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964 and Porter and Lawler, 1968), which states that moti- &bull;
vation will be high when people know what they have to do to get a reward, expect that
they will be able to get the reward and expect that the reward will be worthwhile.
<p>Goal theory (Latham and Locke, 1979), which states that motivation and performance &bull;
are higher when individuals are set specific goals, when goals are difficult but accepted,
and when there is feedback on performance.
<p>Equity theory (Adams, 1965), which states that people will be better motivated if they &bull;
are treated equitably, and demotivated if they are treated inequitably. There are two
forms of equity: distributive equity or distributive justice, which is concerned with the
fairness with which people feel they are rewarded in accordance with their contribution
and in comparison with others; and procedural equity or procedural justice, which is
concerned with the perceptions employees have about the fairness with which company
procedures in such areas as performance management, promotion and discipline are
being operated.
<p>The main distinction between content and process theory is that the former provides guidance
on what needs should be satisfied by a reward system while the latter indicates how they should
be satisfied, especially in pay schemes that are contingent on performance, contribution or
skill. In their case, process theory is the most important.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>22 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Cognitive evaluation theory
<p>Cognitive evaluation theory (CET) as devised by Deci (1975) and Deci and Ryan (1985) argues
that placing strong emphasis on monetary rewards decreases people&rsquo;s interest in the work
itself, thus dampening a powerful alternative source of motivation. In other words, extrinsic
rewards erode intrinsic interest.
<p>Principal agent theory
<p>Principal agent theory, sometimes known as agency theory, is based on the supposition that
the separation between the owners (the principals) and the agents (the managers) means that
the principals may not have complete control over their agents. The latter may therefore act in
ways which conflict with what the principals want. So it is desirable to provide for &lsquo;incentive
alignment&rsquo;, which means paying for measurable results deemed to be in the best interests of
the owners.
<p>The psychological contract
<p>A psychological contract is a set of unwritten expectations that exist between individual
employees and their employers. As Guest (2007) noted, it is concerned with: &lsquo;The perceptions
of both parties to the employment relationship of the reciprocal promises and obligations
implied in that relationship&rsquo;. A psychological contract is a system of beliefs that encompasses
the actions employees think are expected of them and what response they expect in return
from their employer, and, reciprocally, the actions employers believe are expected of them and
what response they expect in return from their employees.
<p>The concept of the psychological contract highlights the fact that employee/employer expecta-
tions take the form of unarticulated assumptions. Disappointments on the part of manage-
ment as well as employees may therefore be inevitable. These disappointments can, however,
be alleviated if managements appreciate that one of their key roles is to manage expectations,
which means clarifying what they believe employees should achieve, the competencies they
should possess and the values they should uphold. All this can be done through reward and
performance management.
<p>Pay level concepts
<p>There are a number of explanations of how levels of pay are determined and, therefore, the
factors that need to be taken into account in deciding on the value of jobs and the design of
grade and pay structures. Economic theories of pay and efficiency wage theory are perhaps the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>An Overview of Reward Management 23
<p>more influential ones but there are other concepts such as human capital, principal agent
theory, tournament theory and the effort bargain. These are described in Chapter 15.
<p>Effective reward management
<p>The criteria for judging the effectiveness of a reward management system is the extent to
which it:
<p>is fit for purpose &ndash; the contribution it makes to achieving organizational objectives and &bull;
recognizing the needs and wants of stakeholders;
<p>is appropriate &ndash; fits the culture and context of the organization; &bull;
<p>is designed in accord with what is generally regarded as good practice in the particular &bull;
context of the organization, subject to the requirement that it must be appropriate;
<p>functions in line with well-defined guiding principles, which include the need to &bull;
achieve fairness, equity, consistency and transparency in operating the reward system;
<p>includes processes for valuing and grading jobs and rewarding people according to &bull;
their performance or contribution that are properly conceived and function well;
<p>makes a significant impact on performance through performance management or con- &bull;
tributions to high-performance working;
<p>has produced an attractive employee-value proposition; &bull;
<p>provides rewards that attract and retain people and enlist their engagement; &bull;
<p>maintains competitive and equitable rates of pay; &bull;
<p>incorporates successfully a total rewards approach; &bull;
<p>manages reward processes carefully and obtains value for money; &bull;
<p>provides for the evaluation of reward processes and taking corrective action as necessary; &bull;
<p>communicates to all concerned how the reward system operates and how it affects &bull;
them;
<p>provides for the devolution of a reasonable degree of authority to line managers to &bull;
make reward decisions, taking steps to ensure that they have the skills and support
required and that their decisions are in line with reward policy guidelines.
<p>Effective reward in the best performing firms
<p>The best-performing firms as established by Watson Wyatt (2002) view their reward pro-
grammes differently from the lower-performing organizations:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>24 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Top firms are more likely to use rewards as tools to engage people in improving business &bull;
performance.
<p>These firms make greater efforts than others to communicate their plans and to measure &bull;
reward plan effectiveness.
<p>They are more likely than the rest to link rewards to their organization&rsquo;s business &bull;
strategies.
<p>Reward management: six tips
Reward people according to the value they create. &bull;
<p>Reward people according to what the organization values and wants to pay for. &bull;
<p>Take account of employee as well as business needs. &bull;
<p>Best fit is preferable to best practice. &bull;
<p>Strive to be different, even unique, when developing reward policy and practice. &bull;
<p>Adopt an evidence-based management approach that involves managing &bull;
reward systems on the basis of fact rather than opinion, on understanding
rather than assumptions, on grounded theory rather than dogma.

<p>Introduction
<p>A reward system consists of the interrelated processes and practices that combine to ensure
that reward management is carried out effectively to the benefit of the organization and the
people who work there. It operates in accordance with the principles of systems theory, which
as Katz and Kahn (1966) wrote, &lsquo;is basically concerned with problems of relationship, of struc-
ture and of interdependence&rsquo;. It has the characteristics of an open system as described by
Miller and Rice (1967), who stated that organizations should be treated as such in that they are
continually dependent upon and influenced by their environments.
<p>This chapter starts with an analysis of how a reward system operates and continues with a
description of the components of a system. Examples of actual systems are then given.

<p>28 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Reward systems are based on the reward strategy, which flows from the business strategy, for
example to gain competitive advantage, and the HR strategy, which is influenced by the busi-
ness strategy but also influences it. The HR strategy may, for example, focus on resourcing but
it should also be concerned with satisfying people as well as business needs. All these aspects
of strategy are affected by the environment. Reward strategies direct the development and
operation of reward practices and processes and also form the basis of reward policies, which
in turn affect reward practices, processes and procedures. These different aspects of a reward
system are defined below.
<p>Reward strategies
<p>These set out what the organization intends to do in the longer term to develop and imple-
ment reward policies, practices, processes and procedures that will further the achievement of
its business and HRM goals.
<p>Reward policies
<p>These set guidelines for decision making and action.
<p>Reward practices
<p>These comprise the schemes, structures and techniques used to implement reward strategy
and policy: for example, the policy on pay levels will lead to the practice of collecting and ana-
lysing market rate data, and making pay adjustments that reflect market rates of increase.
<p>Reward processes
<p>These consist of the ways in which policies are implemented and practices carried out; for
example, how the outcomes of surveys are applied and how managers manage the pay adjust-
ment and review process.
<p>Reward procedures
<p>These are operated in order to maintain the system and to ensure that it functions efficiently
and flexibly and provides value for money; an example is a procedure for conducting an annual
pay review.
<p>Components of a reward system
<p>The components of a reward system and the interrelationships between them are shown in
Figure 2.2. A brief description of each element follows.</p>

<p>Business strategy
<p>The starting point of the reward system is the business strategy of the organization. This iden-
tifies the business drivers and sets out the business goals. The drivers are unique to any organ-
ization but will often include items such as high performance, profitability, productivity,
innovation, customer service, quality, price/cost leadership and the need to satisfy stakehold-
ers &ndash; investors, shareholders, employees, elected representatives.</p>

<p>30 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Reward strategy
<p>The reward strategy flows from an analysis of the business drivers. The question is: &lsquo;How can
these be supported by reward in order to achieve the goals of the business?&rsquo; The strategy will
define longer-term intentions in such areas as pay structures, contingent pay, employee ben-
efits, steps to increase engagement and commitment and adopting a total reward approach.
<p>Reward policy
<p>Reward policy will cover such matters as:
<p>The level of rewards: this will be related to a view on how internal rates should compare &bull;
with market rates, in other words, the organization&rsquo;s &lsquo;market stance&rsquo;.
<p>External competitiveness versus internal equity: the balance between being &lsquo;market &bull;
driven&rsquo;, whereby pay levels are governed by market rates, and being more concerned
with the extent to which equal pay is provided for work of equal value.
<p>Transparency: how much information will be released about pay policies and levels. &bull;
<p>Pay decisions: fixing rates of pay on appointment or promotion. &bull;
<p>Assimilation: how employees will be assimilated into revised grade and pay structures. &bull;
<p>Protection: how employees whose pay is above the maximum for their grade should be &bull;
protected from a reduction in salary.
<p>Base or basic pay
<p>The base rate is the amount of pay (the fixed salary or wage) that constitutes the rate for the
job. It may be varied according to the grade of the job or, for shopfloor workers, the level of
skill required.
<p>Base pay will be influenced by internal and external relativities (going rates). The internal rel-
ativities may be measured by some form of job evaluation. External relativities are assessed by
tracking market rates. Alternatively, levels of pay may be agreed through collective bargaining
with trade unions or by reaching individual agreements. Base pay management is achieved
through grade and pay structures.
<p>Base pay may be expressed as an annual, weekly or hourly rate. The latter is sometimes called
a time rate system of payment. The base rate may be adjusted to reflect increases in the cost of
living or market rates by the organization unilaterally or by agreement with a trade union. Pay
that is related entirely to the value of the job rather than the person is called job-based pay.
Where the base rate can be enhanced by payments related to a person&rsquo;s level of competency or
skill it is known as person-based pay. The latter term can be extended to include contingent
pay, which rewards people for their performance or contribution.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>The Reward System 31
<p>Job evaluation
<p>Job evaluation is a systematic process for defining the relative worth or size of jobs within an
organization in order to establish internal relativities and provide the basis for designing an
equitable grade structure, grading jobs in the structure and managing relativities. It does not
determine the level of pay directly. Job evaluation can be analytical or non-analytical. It is
based on the analysis of jobs or roles, which leads to the production of job descriptions or role
profiles. Job evaluation is described in Chapter 16.
<p>Market rate analysis
<p>Market rate analysis is the process of identifying the rates of pay in the labour market for com-
parable jobs to inform decisions on levels of pay within the organization and on pay struc-
tures. A policy decision may be made on how internal rates of pay should compare with exter-
nal rates &ndash; an organization&rsquo;s market stance. Market rate analysis is described in Chapter 18.
<p>Grade and pay structure
<p>This is a hierarchy of job grades, bands or levels into which groups of jobs that are broadly
comparable in size are placed. Pay ranges are attached to grades that take account of market
rates and provide scope for pay progression based on performance, contribution, competence
or service. The main types of structures are:
<p>Multi-graded structure: one consisting of 10 or more job grades into which jobs of &bull;
broadly equivalent value are placed. The pay span in each grade may be fairly small.
Also known as a narrow-graded structure.
<p>Broad-banded structure: a pay structure with a small number (typically four or five) of &bull;
wide bands.
<p>Broad-graded structures: grade and pay structures with six to nine grades. &bull;
<p>Job-family structure: a grade and pay structure consisting of a number of separate job &bull;
families. Each family may constitute a market group in which rates of pay are related to
market rates and may differ from that of equivalent jobs in other families. (A job family
consists of a group of jobs in a function or occupation that are related through the
activities carried out and the basic knowledge and skills required, but in which levels of
responsibility, knowledge, skills and competency levels differ.)
<p>Career-family structure: a grade and pay structure consisting of a number of separate &bull;
job families. It is distinguished from a job-family structure by having the same levels of
pay for equivalent jobs in different families. As the name implies, the emphasis is on
defining career paths or ladders as well as providing a grade and pay structure.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>32 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Pay spine: a structure consisting of a series of fixed increments (incremental points) &bull;
extending from the lowest to the highest-paid jobs covered by the structure. Progres-
sion is usually based on service but scope is sometimes given for it to be related to per-
formance or contribution. The pay spine may be divided into grades.
<p>Spot rate: the rate for a job or an individual that is not fitted into a grade or band in a &bull;
conventional grade structure and does not allow any scope for pay progression.
<p>Pay progression
<p>Pay progression takes place when base pay advances through pay brackets in a grade and pay
structure or through promotions or upgradings. Progression through pay brackets may be
determined formally through a contingent pay scheme or by means of fixed increments as
described below. Informal progression takes place when there is no contingent or incremental
pay scheme and increases are arbitrary. This is often the case when there is a spot rate system
in the absence of a pay structure. As established by the CIPD 2009 reward survey, the most
popular method of progressing someone along their pay scale (66 per cent of respondents) is
to use a combination approach consisting of a number of factors such as individual perform-
ance, competency and length of service.
<p>Contingent pay progression is typically but not inevitably governed by performance ratings,
which are often made at the time of the performance management review but may be made
separately in a special pay review. Some organizations do not base increases on formal ratings
and instead rely on a general assessment of how much the pay of individuals should increase
by reference to performance, potential, the pay levels of their peers and their &lsquo;market worth&rsquo;
(the rate of pay it is believed they could earn elsewhere).
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward survey found that the most popular approach (66 per cent) to pro-
gressing someone along their pay scale is to use a number of factors (a combination approach),
such as individual performance and length of service, while other employers use solely one
factor, such as individual performance (13 per cent) or length of service (8 per cent).
<p>Contingent pay for performance, contribution, competence or skill
<p>Contingent pay is concerned with answering two fundamental reward management ques-
tions: 1) what do we value?, and 2) what are we prepared to pay for? Individual contingent pay
schemes provide additional financial rewards related to levels of performance, contribution,
competence or skill. Contingent pay may be related to team or organizational performance
(profit sharing, gain sharing or employee share schemes).
<p>Individual contingent scheme payments may be added to base pay (ie &lsquo;consolidated&rsquo;). Alterna-
tively or additionally they may be paid as cash bonuses. This is described as &lsquo;variable pay&rsquo; and
the payments are not consolidated. The main contingent pay schemes for individuals are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>The Reward System 33
<p>performance-related pay, which provides individuals with financial rewards in the &bull;
form of increases to basic pay or cash bonuses that are linked to an assessment of per-
formance, usually in relation to agreed objectives;
<p>contribution-related pay, which provides financial rewards related to both outputs &bull;
(performance) and inputs (competence);
<p>competency-related pay, which rewards people by reference to the level of competence &bull;
they demonstrate in carrying out their roles;
<p>skill-based pay, which provides employees with a direct link between their pay &bull;
progression and the skills they have acquired and use effectively.
<p>Service-related pay
<p>Service-related pay provides fixed increments, which are usually paid annually to people on
the basis of continued service either in a job or a grade in a pay spine structure. Increments
may be withheld for unacceptable performance (although this is rare) and some structures
have a &lsquo;merit bar&rsquo; that limits increments unless a defined level of &lsquo;merit&rsquo; has been achieved.
This is the traditional form of contingent pay and is still common in the public and voluntary
sectors and in education and the health service, although it has largely been abandoned in the
private sector.
<p>Service-related pay is supported by many unions because they perceive it as being fair &ndash; every-
one is treated equally. It is felt that linking pay to time in the job rather than performance or
competence avoids the partial and ill-informed judgements about people that managers are
prone to make. Some people believe that the principle of rewarding people for loyalty through
continued service is a good one. It is also easy to manage; in fact, it does not need to be
managed at all.
<p>The arguments against service-related pay are that:
<p>It is inequitable in the sense that an equal allocation of pay increases according to &bull;
service does not recognize the fact that some people will be contributing more than
others and should be rewarded accordingly.
<p>It does not encourage good performance; indeed, it rewards poor performance as much &bull;
as good.
<p>It is based on the assumption that performance improves with experience, but this is &bull;
not automatically the case.
<p>It can be expensive &ndash; everyone may drift to the top of the scale, especially in times of &bull;
low staff turnover, but the cost of their pay is not justified by the added value they
provide.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>34 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>The arguments against service-related pay have convinced most businesses, although some are
concerned about managing any other form of contingent-pay schemes. They may also have to
face strong resistance from their unions and can be unsure of what exit strategy they should
adopt if they want to change. They may therefore stick with the status quo.
<p>Pensions and employee benefits
<p>Pensions and employee benefits such as sick pay, insurance cover, company cars and a number
of other &lsquo;perks&rsquo; comprise elements of remuneration additional to the various forms of cash
pay, and also include provisions for employees that are not strictly remuneration, such as
annual holidays (see Chapters 24&ndash;26). &lsquo;Flexible&rsquo; benefit schemes allow employees to decide on
the make-up of their benefits package within certain limits.
<p>Allowances
<p>Allowances are paid in addition to basic pay for special circumstances (eg living in London) or
features of employment (working unsocial hours). They may be determined unilaterally by
the organization but they are often the subject of negotiation. The main types of allowances
are location allowances, overtime payments, shift payments, working conditions allowances,
and stand-by or call-out allowances (made to those who have to be available to come in to
work when required).
<p>Performance management
<p>Performance management processes (see Chapter 6) define individual performance and con-
tribution expectations, assess performance against those expectations, provide for regular
constructive feedback, and result in agreed plans for performance improvement, learning and
personal development. They are a means of providing non-financial motivation and may also
inform contingent pay decisions.
<p>Non-financial rewards
<p>Non-financial rewards (see Chapter 9) do not involve any direct payments and often arise
from the work itself, for example recognition, achievement, autonomy, scope to use and
develop skills, training, career development opportunities and high-quality leadership.
<p>Total remuneration
<p>Total remuneration is the value of all cash payments (base pay, contingent pay and allowances,
ie total earnings) plus the pensions and benefits received by employees.</p>

<p>40 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Introduction
<p>The concept of total rewards describes an approach to reward management that emphasizes
the need to consider all aspects of the work experience of value to employees, not just a few
such as pay and employee benefits. It aims to blend the financial and non-financial elements
of reward into a cohesive whole. The first person to refer in effect to total rewards was Adam
Smith in 1776. He identified several components of what he called &lsquo;total net advantage&rsquo; besides
pay, namely: agreeableness or disagreeableness of work, difficulty and expense of learning it,
job security, responsibility and the possibility of success or failure.
<p>This chapter begins with a definition of the total rewards concept. Its importance is then
explained and the various models and different components of total rewards are described.
The chapter concludes with a description of how a total rewards approach to reward manage-
ment can be developed, and a number of examples.
<p>Total rewards defined
<p>A total rewards approach links all aspects of reward together and treats them as an integrated
and coherent whole. It means that when developing the reward system employers must con-
sider all aspects of the work experience that employees value. One of the first people to write
about total rewards after Adam Smith (O&rsquo;Neal, 1998) commented that: &lsquo;Total reward embraces
everything that employees value in the employment relationship.&rsquo; As defined by Manus and
Graham (2003), total rewards &lsquo;includes all types of rewards &ndash; indirect as well as direct, and
intrinsic as well as extrinsic&rsquo;. Kantor and Kao (2004) define total rewards as &lsquo;Everything an
employee gets as a result of working for the company&rsquo;.
<p>An equally wide definition was offered by WorldatWork (2000), who stated that total rewards
are &lsquo;all of the employer&rsquo;s available tools that may be used to attract, retain, motivate and satisfy
employees&rsquo;. Paul Thompson (2002) suggests that:
<p>Definitions of total rewards typically encompass not only traditional, quantifiable ele-
ments like salary, variable pay and benefits, but also more intangible non-cash ele-
ments such as scope to achieve and exercise responsibility, career opportunities, learning
and development, the intrinsic motivation provided by the work itself and the quality
of working life provided by the organization.
<p>The total rewards approach recognizes that it is necessary to get financial rewards (pay and
benefits) right. But it also appreciates the importance of providing people with rewarding
experiences that arise from the work they do, their work environment, how they are managed
and the opportunity to develop their skills and careers. It contributes to the production of an </p>

<p>employee value proposition that provides a clear, compelling reason why talented people
should work for a company.
<p>It is a holistic view of reward that looks at the overall reward system in order to determine how
its elements should be integrated so that they provide mutual support in contributing to the
overall effectiveness of the system. Reliance is not placed on one or two reward mechanisms
operating in isolation; instead, account is taken of every way in which people can be rewarded
and obtain satisfaction through their work. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The
aim is to maximize the combined impact of a wide range of reward initiatives on motivation,
commitment and job engagement.
<p>However, IDS (2008) commented that: &lsquo;While as a philosophy, total reward emphasizes the
value of the non-financial aspects of the employee value proposition, pay remains the founda-
tion upon which everything else is built.&rsquo;
<p>The notion of total rewards can be described as a perspective on reward management rather
than reward management itself. It influences those aspects of reward management concerned
with the nature and choice of rewards but does not specifically deal with the reward manage-
ment functions of job evaluation, market rate analysis, grade and pay structure design and the
administration of reward systems. The term total rewards rather than total reward is adopted
in this book because it was the term used when the concept was first introduced in the United
States in the 1990s and it conveys the basic principle that there are a number of ways of reward-
ing people besides pay.
<p>Underpinning concepts
<p>Two concepts underpin total rewards: intrinsic motivation and integration.
<p>Intrinsic motivation
<p>The philosophy of total rewards is strongly influenced by the concept of intrinsic motivation,
which arises from the work itself and its impact on the self-generated factors that influence
people&rsquo;s behaviour. Motivation theory spells out the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic
motivation and indicates that high levels of motivation and performance are achieved by sat-
isfying a variety of needs, only one of which is for money, and this is precisely what total
rewards aims to do. Intrinsic motivation takes place when individuals feel that their work is
important, interesting and challenging and provides them with a reasonable degree of auton-
omy (freedom to act), opportunities to achieve and advance, and scope to use and develop
their skills and abilities. Deci and Ryan (1985) suggested that intrinsic motivation is based on
the needs to be competent and self-determining (that is, to have a choice).</p>

<p>42 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Integration
<p>A total rewards strategy involves the horizontal integration of reward and other HR strategies
to achieve greater impact and internal consistency. This is the process of &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; &ndash; the
development and implementation of several HR practices together so that they are interre-
lated and therefore complement and reinforce each other (also referred to as configuration or
the use of &lsquo;complementarities&rsquo;). MacDuffie (1995) explained the concept of bundling as
follows:
<p>Implicit in the notion of a &lsquo;bundle&rsquo; is the idea that practices within bundles are inter-
related and internally consistent, and that &lsquo;more is better&rsquo; with respect to the impact on
performance, because of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing effect of multiple
practices.
<p>The elements of total rewards
<p>The concept of total rewards combines the impact of the two major categories of reward as
defined below and illustrated in Figure 3.1:
<p>Transactional rewards: tangible (financial) rewards arising from transactions between &bull;
the employer and employees concerning pay and benefits. These are all extrinsic.
<p>Relational rewards: intangible (non-financial) rewards concerned with the work envi- &bull;
ronment (quality of working life, the work itself, work&ndash;life balance), recognition, per-
formance management and learning and development. The work environment provides
intrinsic rewards, recognition is extrinsic, performance management is mainly extrin-
sic and learning and development is primarily intrinsic in so far as it provides oppor-
tunities for growth.

<p>The significance of total rewards
<p>The basic premise of total rewards is that there is more to rewarding people than throwing
money at them. As Giancola (2008) notes, &lsquo;It is effective because it focuses on the big picture.&rsquo;
<p>For Sandra O&rsquo;Neal (1998), a total rewards strategy is critical to addressing the issues created by
recruitment and retention as well as providing a means of influencing behaviour: &lsquo;It can help
create a work experience that meets the needs of employees and encourages them to contrib-
ute extra effort, by developing a deal that addresses a broad range of issues and by spending
reward dollars where they will be most effective in addressing workers&rsquo; shifting values.&rsquo;
<p>A powerful argument for a total rewards approach was produced by Pfeffer (1998):
<p>Creating a fun, challenging, and empowered work environment in which individuals
are able to use their abilities to do meaningful jobs for which they are shown apprecia-
tion is likely to be a more certain way to enhance motivation and performance &ndash; even
though creating such an environment may be more difficult and take more time than
simply turning the reward lever.
<p>Benefits of total rewards
<p>The benefits of a total rewards approach are:
<p>Greater impact: the combined effect of the different types of rewards will make a deeper &bull;
and longer-lasting impact on the motivation and commitment of people.
<p>Enhancing the employment relationship: the employment relationship created by a &bull;
total rewards approach makes the maximum use of relational as well as transactional
rewards and will therefore appeal more to individuals.
<p>Flexibility to meet individual needs: as pointed out by Milkovich and Bloom (1998): &bull;
&lsquo;Relational rewards may bind individuals more strongly to the organization because
they can answer those special individual needs.&rsquo; Kantor and Kao (2004) comment that:
&lsquo;Companies today are managing a much more heterogeneous population. For the
diverse workforce, no single component becomes a value driver. Employees have
choices to make and a need for greater flexibility.&rsquo;
<p>Attraction and retention: relational rewards help to deliver a positive psychological &bull;
contract. The organization can become an &lsquo;employer of choice&rsquo; and &lsquo;a great place to
work&rsquo;, thus attracting and retaining the talented people it needs.</p>

<p>44 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Models of total rewards
<p>Many models of total rewards have been produced and a selection of the better-known ones is
summarized below. The purpose of the models is to provide a framework for developing total
rewards by identifying financial and non-financial elements and in some cases indicating how
they relate to one another. They provide a basis for defining a total rewards policy and for
communicating it to employees.
<p>Towers Perrin
<p>The Towers Perrin model shown in Figure 3.2 is a matrix with four quadrants. The upper two
quadrants &ndash; pay and benefits &ndash; represent transactional or tangible rewards. These are financial
in nature and are essential to recruit and retain staff but can be easily copied by competitors.
By contrast, the relational or intangible non-financial rewards represented in the lower two
quadrants cannot be imitated so readily and can therefore create both human capital and
human process advantage, as defined in Chapter 1. They are essential to enhancing the value
of the upper two quadrants. The real power, as Thompson (2002) states, comes when organi-
zations combine relational and transactional rewards. The model also makes a useful distinc-
tion between individual and communal rewards, particularly in the latter case.

<p>The current and required total rewards strategy in a public sector organization, developed
with their top 50 managers working in groups and using the Towers Perrin model, is shown in
Figure 3.3.
<p>WorldatWork
<p>WorldatWork, formerly the American Compensation Association, introduced the concept of
total rewards in the 1990s. Their first model was produced in 2000 and revised in 2006 (Chris-
topherson and King, 2006).
<p>The five elements of total rewards in the 2006 model are compensation, benefits, work&ndash;life
balance, performance and recognition, and development and career opportunities. These are
influenced by the external environment, the work experience, organizational culture and the
business and HR strategies. The combined five elements facilitate the attraction, motivation
and retention of employees, which enhances their satisfaction and engagement and impacts
on business performance and results.
<p>Zingheim and Schuster
<p>The total rewards model developed by Zingheim and Schuster (2000) expresses total rewards
as four interlocked and directly related components as shown in Figure 3.4.

sic reward made by two consultancies following their research. Sibson Consulting (2006)
noted that: &lsquo;Work content is always the largest motivator of good performance and most con-
sistent driver of retention&rsquo; and Towers Perrin (2007) observed that challenging and meaning-
ful work is among the top 10 items for attracting and engaging employees.

<br>
<p>50 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>These steps are discussed below.
<p>Clarify the concept of total rewards
<p>A programme for developing total rewards should start with a clarification of the meaning of
the concept to the organization and a definition of its objectives, taking into account the cir-
cumstances and requirements of the business and the views and needs of its employees and
other stakeholders. Statements of meaning and purpose provide the basis for further discus-
sions with stakeholders, decisions on the elements of a total rewards programme and the prep-
aration of a business case.
<p>Involve stakeholders
<p>Stakeholders should be involved as much as possible in developing total rewards. These include
line managers, employees and employee representatives. Their commitment to the programme
will be enhanced if they can contribute their ideas at the stages when the broad aims and fea-
tures of the concept are defined and when the elements of total rewards are selected and their
introduction prioritized.
<p>As described by McCormick (2009), the method of involvement used by Camden Council in
developing total rewards was to conduct focus groups with a cross-section of employees, carry
out an employee total rewards attitude survey online and re-analyse a recent general staff
survey.
<p>Identify total rewards elements
<p>In its basic form, a total rewards approach means simply getting the financial reward elements
right and consciously doing whatever is possible progressively to enhance the elements that
contribute to non-financial rewards. These include HR practices such as learning and devel-
opment, career management, reward practices such as recognition schemes and flexible ben-
efits, and HR policies such as work&ndash;life balance, leadership development programmes, job and
work design and anything else that will improve the working environment. The only problem
with this approach is that it could be unfocused. Something more specific based on one of the
total rewards models may be better.
<p>The core of any model will be pay and benefits, but there is a choice on what other non-finan-
cial elements should be included. An analysis of the non-financial elements contained in the
various models listed earlier shows that there are plenty to choose from &ndash; 37 in all. The choice
is made more difficult because while some elements such as recognition, performance man-
agement, work&ndash;life balance and, to a degree, learning and development are clear-cut, others
such as the work environment and organizational culture are more diffuse. It is relatively easy
to plan programmes for developing clear-cut elements. It is more difficult to deal with the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Total Rewards 51
<p>diffuse elements. For example, culture change is a long-haul activity that is not susceptible to
precise programming in order to achieve quick-fix results although, as noted in Chapter 1,
there are a number of ways in which a reward system can reinforce and in the longer term help
to change a culture.
<p>There are three basic approaches that can be adopted:
<p>A deductive approach, as described by Peter Reilly of the Institute for Employment &bull;
Studies (2009), which means taking one of the models and seeing how well it applies
and then using the management perspective to see how well employees fit. It may
involve selecting the most appealing consultant&rsquo;s model on the grounds that it contains
a more attractive portfolio of elements and/or because of the reputation of the consul-
tancy. The consultants can then be engaged to develop total rewards, as the Hay Group
did for the Cabinet Office in the UK.
<p>An inductive approach, as described by Reilly, which means first collecting the views of &bull;
employees and making sense of them, then interactively fitting these views with a model
and finally establishing and dealing with any gap between the positions of employees
and management.
<p>Distil the existing models, benchmark the total rewards experiences of other organiza- &bull;
tions and produce an individualized approach: for example pay, benefits, recognition,
career development, work&ndash;life balance, performance management and work environ-
ment. These could all be defined and programmes produced for their development.
<p> Add recognition or another element to pay and benefits as a starting point, and bring
in other elements as part of a longer-term strategic HR plan.
<p>There is plenty of choice, and decisions on what elements should be included should be based
on an assessment by all the stakeholders of the context and the requirements of the organiza-
tion and its employees. Current arrangements should be analysed to determine the extent to
which any element can be included or the amount of work required to introduce it as part of
the model. The criteria for choice would be the extent to which the element is appropriate, will
benefit the organization and its employees in specific ways, and can be implemented without
too much difficulty.
<p>Prioritize
<p>It is best not to be too ambitious in introducing total rewards. Start by identifying &lsquo;win&ndash;win&rsquo;
initiatives &ndash; those that are likely to have a notable effect on employee engagement and can be
developed without too much difficulty. If a comprehensive approach is envisaged, priorities
will need to be established and the introduction of the less immediate elements phased. In a
recent example of a local authority introducing total rewards, it was decided that some aspects
of financial rewards, namely job evaluation and the pay structure, needed to be changed, while </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>52 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>for non-financial rewards priority should be given to introducing a recognition scheme. Ini-
tiatives in other areas such as job design, leadership development and improvements in the
performance management system were scheduled to follow.
<p>Examples of possible developments are given below:
<p>Revise grade and pay structure, possibly instituting a career-family structure that &bull;
defines career paths.
<p>Revise contingent pay scheme or develop new one. Include leadership and upholding &bull;
core values as important factors in a contribution-related pay scheme.
<p>Introduce flexible benefits scheme. &bull;
<p>Issue total rewards statements that spell out to employees the value of all the benefits &bull;
they receive in addition to pay.
<p>Introduce a non-financial recognition scheme. &bull;
<p>Improve performance management system, including leadership and upholding core &bull;
values as important factors.
<p>Enhance learning and development, talent management and career development pro- &bull;
grammes.
<p>Focus management development programmes on improving the ability of line manag- &bull;
ers to play a major part in providing relational rewards.
<p>Take steps to improve work&ndash;life balance. &bull;
<p>Educate line managers in the principles of job design and provide guidance to them on &bull;
developing roles that provide for intrinsic motivation.
<p>Make the business case for total rewards
<p>The business case for total rewards aims to demonstrate that an investment of time, effort and
money in introducing total rewards will produce a return in the form of performance improve-
ments resulting from higher levels of engagement. But this is not easy to do. As Giancola
(2008) remarked: &lsquo;Total rewards is a very challenging concept when it includes the intrinsic
work-environment&rsquo; factors. He noted that in these circumstances a total rewards strategy can
seem to equate to HR strategy. This is fine if it means that reward strategy is integrated with
HR strategy but a lot of practitioners &ndash; and senior managers &ndash; may feel that there is nothing
new in the concept. If the HR strategy of a company is to create a learning culture, implement
leadership development programmes, pursue talent management initiatives, develop work&ndash;
life balance policies, encourage and train line managers to pay attention to job design, and
improve employee voice arrangements, it will probably seem that the notion of total rewards
is superfluous. Not many companies do all these things all at once. Even if they only do some </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Total Rewards 53
<p>of them, it may be difficult to persuade management that a total rewards approach offers new
insights, although it can provide impetus to developments on a broader HR front.
<p>But there are a number of compelling points that can be made in a business case for total
rewards. It can be argued that it can help to achieve one or more of the following:
<p>promote a culture that values, recognizes and rewards outstanding performance; &bull;
<p>achieve competitive advantage by offering levels of choice and personalization not pro- &bull;
vided by other employers competing for the same type of people;
<p>meet varied and changing employee needs by introducing more value, choice and flex- &bull;
ibility;
<p>help to make the company an &lsquo;employer of choice&rsquo; for people already employed there, &bull;
as well as for potential recruits;
<p>enhance employees&rsquo; engagement and therefore performance; &bull;
<p>ensure that the best use is made of all the possible ways of rewarding people, in combi- &bull;
nation as well as individually;
<p>avoid dependence on dubious and expensive financial incentives. &bull;
<p>The arguments need to be supported by explanations related to the specific circumstances and
needs of the organization of how any of these desirable results will be obtained with the help
of total rewards.
<p>Plan the development programme
<p>Introducing total rewards in its fullest sense is not easy. WorldatWork (2000) commented that
total rewards are &lsquo;simple in concept and, at best, complex in execution&rsquo;. The transactional and
tangible elements of total rewards (financial rewards) are quite clear-cut. It may not be easy to
make them work well but, as explained in later chapters of this book, it is not too difficult to
decide on what needs to be done. There are plenty of guidelines available to help in selecting
the approach and to indicate the means available for the design and implementation of tangi-
ble reward processes. Recognition schemes, which may be financial or non-financial (or a
combination of the two), can be included in this category.
<p>Relational or non-financial rewards are more difficult. It is not a matter of implementing
quick-fix programmes. The organization can contribute by communicating the values,
giving employees a voice, setting up performance management processes, instituting formal
recognition schemes and taking steps to improve work&ndash;life balance. A conscious effort can
be made to &lsquo;bundle&rsquo; reward and HR practices together, for example developing career-fam-
ily structures where the emphasis is on mapping career paths rather than providing a pay
structure. Importantly, the organization can ensure that line managers appreciate the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>54 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>importance of using relational rewards &ndash; exercising effective leadership, giving feedback,
recognizing achievement and providing meaningful work. Ultimately, relational rewards
are in the hands of line managers, and what the organization must do is to ensure as far as
possible that they understand the significance of this aspect of their work and are given the
training and guidance needed to acquire the skills to do it well.
<p>Communicate
<p>The nature of the total rewards concept &ndash; how it will be introduced and managed and how
people will benefit &ndash; needs to be communicated. Models such as those used in the examples
given later in this chapter can help. It is particularly important to communicate to line manag-
ers the importance of their role in implementing total rewards.
<p>Total rewards statements, as discussed in Chapter 24, communicate to employees the value of
the employee benefits such as pensions, holidays, company cars, free car parking and subsi-
dized meals they receive in addition to their pay. They also describe any other rewards they get
such as learning and development opportunities. The aim is to ensure that they appreciate the
total value of their reward package.
<p>Involve line managers
<p>Line managers contribute to the management of total rewards in six important ways:
<p>They have considerable influence over the management of financial rewards, agreeing &bull;
starting salaries and proposing pay increases and bonuses.
<p>The effectiveness of performance management as a reward process involving feedback &bull;
and the initiation of individual learning and development programmes is mainly up to
them.
<p>They are the most important elements in a recognition scheme &ndash; giving praise where &bull;
praise is due, publicly acknowledging high performance and making recognition
awards as provided for by the scheme.
<p>They strongly influence how jobs are designed and therefore the degree to which people &bull;
are provided with intrinsic rewards from the work itself.
<p>They control the degree of work flexibility that can take place, and therefore work&ndash;life &bull;
balance.
<p>It is their qualities of leadership that largely contribute to the creation of a rewarding &bull;
work environment.
<p>This is why their involvement in the development of total rewards is vital. Management devel-
opment and training programmes that define their role and increase their total rewards man-
agement skills are also important.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Total Rewards 55
<p>Implement
<p>The successful introduction of total rewards is well worthwhile. But while planning a total
rewards programme may be hard, implementing it can be even more difficult. It is an exercise
in change management, for employees generally when new reward practices are being intro-
duced and for line managers in particular if they are expected to change their behaviour. Con-
tinuing communications and involvement of stakeholders are essential.
<p>Monitor and evaluate
<p>It is essential to monitor the implantation of total rewards carefully and then to evaluate how
well each element has worked against the objectives set for it. This can lead to a re-clarification
of the concept and amendments to reward practices as required.
<p>Total rewards in practice
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward management survey found that 20 per cent of respondents claimed
that they had a total rewards strategy although it was not revealed what their strategies con-
tained. More insight into total rewards practices is provided by looking at examples such as the
10 set out below.

<p>56 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>The commitment to total rewards made by senior management was to:
<p>recognize our best people through career opportunities and reward packages; &bull;
<p>develop all staff to their full potential; &bull;
<p>widen career opportunities for all; &bull;
<p>provide managers with the means to recognize and reward performance locally. &bull;
<p>There is a notable emphasis on learning and development.
<p>AstraZeneca
<p>The total rewards strategy consists of three strands that are packaged as a single value proposi-
tion in the minds of employees and potential employees so that the collective value is enhanced
beyond the individual value of the components.
<p>Competitive and flexible reward
<p>The first pillar of total rewards is the flexible benefits plan, entitled &lsquo;Advantage&rsquo;. This allocates
employees a sum equal to their previous salary and benefits package. They can take most of
this fund in cash, apart from a small core of benefits &ndash; such as a minimum of 20 days&rsquo; holiday
entitlement &ndash; or choose to spend it on items from a large menu of new benefits.
<p>Additionally, the compensation package includes a broad-banded salary structure and three
employee share schemes &ndash; a performance-based share plan, an Inland Revenue-approved
SAYE scheme, and a new-style share incentive plan, to be introduced shortly.
<p>Excellent development opportunities
<p>The second pillar of total rewards includes developing an &lsquo;active&rsquo; performance management
culture &ndash; in other words, not just an annual appraisal but a management style that coaches,
challenges and develops people on the job. Staff are set stretch performance targets, and the
opportunities for learning and progression are clear.
<p>This component of the total rewards strategy also encompasses on-the-job learning, career
development, mentoring, e-learning and further education.
<p>Energized working environment
<p>The third pillar of total rewards is made up of six elements that if executed right can create a
working environment in which people feel motivated and excited. It involves establishing a
consistent organization climate and values to which staff can align their personal beliefs and
values. The elements are effective leadership, communications, the physical environment, rec-
ognition by peers as well as managers, and formalized work&ndash;life policies.</p>

<p>Cabinet Office
<p>The total rewards approach adopted by the Cabinet Office in the form of a toolkit for govern-
ment departments is derived from the Hay Engaged Performance model. As explained by the
Cabinet Office it draws together all the financial and non-financial investments an employer
makes in its workforce. It emphasizes all aspects of reward as an integrated and coherent
whole, from pay and benefits through flexible working to learning and development and the
quality and challenge of the work itself.
<p>The Cabinet Office suggests that the benefits of the total rewards approach to public sector
organizations are that it will help them to recruit, retain and win the engagement of high-
quality staff, align their investment with employee expectations and needs and secure better
value for money. For employees a properly developed total rewards strategy will respond to
employee preferences and values to create an environment that brings out the best in them.
<p>Centrica
<p>The total rewards approach at Centrica concentrates overall on developing reward manage-
ment as a strategic, innovative and integrative process that is designed to meet the evolving
needs of the organization and the people it employs. It involves the use of both:
<p>Financial rewards: base pay, contingent or variable pay, share ownership and employee &bull;
benefits.
<p>Non-financial rewards: the work environment, recognition, quality of working life, &bull;
opportunity to develop and learn skills, and work&ndash;life policies.
<p>Financial Services Authority (FSA)
<p>The four elements of the FSA&rsquo;s total rewards model are:
<p>Pay: basic salary structured into five broad overlapping pay bands, allowing flexibility &bull;
to reflect the external (financial services) market, plus variable pay in the form of a
bonus worth up to 15 per cent of base salary.
<p>Benefits: a flexible benefits plan, covering pensions, health care, insurance, holidays, &bull;
childcare, and a subsidized gym and restaurant on site.
<p>Learning and development: a career development and learning framework based on &bull;
competencies, training and secondment opportunities, performance management,
induction programmes, succession planning and study sponsorship &ndash; including time
off and fees paid.
<p>Work environment: single-status climate with open-plan offices and first names for all, &bull;
an open internal job market, an emphasis on leadership, flat structures and devolved
decision making, a staff consultation committee and work&ndash;life balance.</p>

<p>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)
<p>Paying for performance is the ultimate goal at GSK, and this is championed at the highest
level, by the chief executive. TotalReward, the name by which GSK refers to its approach to
reward, consists of three elements:
<p>total cash (base salary and bonus), plus long-term incentives for managers and executives; &bull;
<p>lifestyle benefits (health care, employee assistance, family support, dental care; &bull;
<p>savings choices (pension plan, ShareSave, ShareReward). &bull;
<p>The complete package, the concept of which is based on employees understanding the total
value of all the rewards they receive, not just the individual elements, is designed to attract,
retain, motivate and develop the best talent. The proposition for employees is that TotalRe-
ward gives them the opportunity to share in the company&rsquo;s success, makes it easier to balance
home and working life, and helps them to take care of themselves and their families.
<p>There is also a recognition scheme, which is seen as another and more immediate way to moti-
vate staff and reward good performance rather than having to wait for the annual bonus. The
scheme gives financial recognition to effort over and above the normal job requirements and
there are four different levels of award &ndash; bronze, silver, gold and platinum &ndash; with taxable
payouts ranging from &pound;50 to &pound;5,000.

<p>Lloyds TSB
<p>The total rewards strategy at Lloyds TSB comprises four elements:
<p>performance and development; &bull;
<p>employee involvement; &bull;
<p>career management and resourcing; &bull;
<p>reward. &bull;
<p>A basic tenet underpinning the concept of total rewards at Lloyds TSB is that managerial aims
such as improving levels of engagement, encouraging better performance and generating a
culture of innovation can rarely be achieved through cash alone.

<p>Total rewards is defined at Nationwide as: &lsquo;A mixture of pay elements, with a defined cash

<p>60 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Unilever
<p>Unilever believes that total rewards encompasses all the elements in &lsquo;what it means to come to
work&rsquo;. It supports the Towers Perrin model of total rewards covering pay, benefits, learning
and development and the work environment, which for Unilever means that it is essential to
create an environment worth working in. For managers, development has been at the heart of
the company&rsquo;s employment offering.
<p>Conclusion
<p>The rhetoric of the total rewards concept is compelling. The reality of total rewards &ndash; making
it work &ndash; is much more difficult. It requires a lot of effort on the part of top management and
line managers, with the determined encouragement and guidance of HR.
<p>Six tips for introducing total rewards
Review the work environment and analyse current reward policies and &bull;
practices.
<p>Research different approaches (models) and benchmark total rewards practices &bull;
elsewhere, especially those to do with selecting and defining the elements of
total rewards and methods of introduction.
<p>Involve stakeholders &ndash; senior management, line managers, employees and their &bull;
representatives &ndash; both in developing the concept of total rewards and at later
stages as appropriate.
<p>Select or develop the total rewards model to be adopted, prioritize the &bull;
introduction of elements as necessary, integrate the total rewards strategy with
the HR strategy, and plan and implement the programme.
<p>Ensure that line managers are equipped to play their part in the total rewards &bull;
programme.
<p>Communicate throughout the programme about what is happening and how &bull;
people will be affected.

<p>Strategic Reward 63
<p>a reward philosophy and incorporate the concept of total rewards. This chapter starts with a
definition of strategic reward and continues with an explanation of its rationale. It next deals
with the philosophical basis of strategic reward as expressed in guiding principles and then
examines how strategic reward functions through the development and implementation of
reward strategies.
<p>Strategic reward management defined
<p>Strategic reward management is an approach to the development and implementation of
reward strategies and the guiding principles that underpin them. As described by Armstrong
and Brown (2006), it provides answers to two basic questions: first, where do we want our
reward practices to be in a few years&rsquo; time? And second, how do we intend to get there? It
therefore deals with both ends and means. As an end it describes a vision of what reward proc-
esses will look like in the future. As a means, it shows how it is expected that the vision will be
realized. Strategic reward can be described as an attitude of mind &ndash; a belief in the need to plan
ahead and make the plans happen.
<p>Strategic reward is based on beliefs about what the organization values and wants to achieve.
It does this by aligning reward practices with both business goals and employee values. As
Duncan Brown (2001) emphasizes, the &lsquo;alignment of your reward practices with employee
values and needs is every bit as important as alignment with business goals, and critical to the
realization of the latter.&rsquo;
<p>The rationale for strategic reward
<p>In the words of Duncan Brown (2001), strategic reward &lsquo;is ultimately a way of thinking that
you can apply to any reward issue arising in your organization, to see how you can create value
from it&rsquo;. More specifically, there are four arguments for adopting a strategic approach to
reward management:
<p>You must have some idea where you are going, or how do you know how to get there, &bull;
and how do you know that you have arrived (if you ever do)?
<p>As Cox and Purcell (1998) explain: &lsquo;The real benefit in reward strategies lies in &bull;
complex linkages with other human resource management policies and practices.&rsquo;
Isn&rsquo;t this a good reason for developing a reward strategic framework that indicates
how reward processes will be aligned to HR processes so that they are coherent and
mutually supportive?
<p>There can be a positive relationship between rewards, in the broadest sense, and per- &bull;
formance, so shouldn&rsquo;t we think about how we can strengthen that link?</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>64 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Pay costs in most organizations are by far the largest item of expense &ndash; they can be 60 &bull;
per cent and often much more in labour-intensive organizations &ndash; so doesn&rsquo;t it make
sense to think about how they should be managed and invested in the longer term?
<p>The problem with the concept of strategic reward
<p>To what extent can pay be strategic? This question was posed by Trevor (2009). He noted that
pay is seen as &lsquo;a means of aligning a company&rsquo;s most strategic asset &ndash; their employees &ndash; to the
strategic direction of the organization&rsquo; and that strategic pay theory is predicated on the notion
of strategic choice. But he claimed that rationalism is limited and pointed out that pay systems
tend to be selected for their legitimacy (best practice as advocated by institutions such as the
CIPD and by management consultants) rather than for purely economic reasons.
<p>His research into the pay policies and practice of three large consumer goods organizations
revealed a gap between intended and actual practice &ndash; intent does not necessarily lead to
action. &lsquo;Irrespective of the strategic desire or the saliency of the design, ineffectual execution
results in ineffectual pay practice which then reacts negatively upon the pay outcomes experi-
enced as a result.&rsquo; The main implications of the findings from this research were that: &lsquo;theory
is out of step with reality and may represent a largely unattainable ideal in practice.&rsquo; As Wright
and Nishii (2004) commented: &lsquo;not all intended HR practices are actually implemented and,
those that are, may often be implemented in ways that differ from the original intention.&rsquo; The
conclusion is that an &lsquo;alternative approach for the use of pay systems in support of strategy is
required: one that acknowledges the relative limits on the ability of companies to manage pay
strategically.&rsquo;
<p>A similar point was made by Armstrong and Brown (2006) when they described &lsquo;the new
reality&rsquo; of strategic reward management as follows:
<p>When mostly North American concepts of strategic HRM and reward first entered into
management thinking and practice in the UK we were both some of their most ardent
advocates, writing and advising individual employers on the benefits of aligning their
reward systems so as to drive business performance. We helped to articulate strategic
plans and visions, and to design the pay and reward changes that would secure better
alignment and performance.
Some 20 years later, we are a little older and a little wiser as a result of these experiences.
We remain passionate proponents of a strategic approach to reward management. But in
conducting and observing this work we have seen some of the risks as well as the opportu-
nities in pursuing the reward strategy path: of an over-focus on planning at the expense of
process and practice; on design rather than delivery; on the boardroom and the HR func-
tion rather than on first and front-line managers and employees; and on concept rather
than communications.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 65
<p> At times there has been a tendency to over-ambition and optimism in terms of what
could and couldn&rsquo;t be achieved by changing pay and reward arrangements, and how
quickly real change could be delivered and business results secured. At times the focus on
internal business fit led to narrow-minded reward determinism, and a lack of attention to
the increasingly important external influences and constraints on reward, from the shift-
ing tax and wider legislative, economic and social environment. And sometimes the focus
on designs and desires meant that the requirements and skills of line and reward manag-
ers were insufficiently diagnosed and developed.
<p>Characteristics of strategic reward
<p>In the light of these comments it is best to regard strategic reward as an attitude of mind rather
than a set of prescribed techniques. It is based on a belief in the need to be forward looking &ndash;
to plan ahead and make the plans happen. It is visionary in the sense that it is concerned with
creating and conceptualizing ideas of where the reward policies and processes of the organiza-
tion should be going. But it is also empirical management that decides how in practice it is
going to get there.
<p>An important characteristic of strategic reward is that it is systematic in the sense that it is
based on analyses of the organization&rsquo;s internal and external environment, its business needs
and the needs of its stakeholders. It is conducted within a framework of articulated beliefs and
values, and it is goal-orientated &ndash; the desired ends and the means of attaining them are clearly
defined. It takes account of the business strategy and what can be done by reward to further its
achievement. Importantly, it is a key instrument in achieving an integrated approach to reward
management, one in which the various aspects of the reward system cohere and are linked to
other HR practices so that they are mutually supportive. It focuses on implementation &ndash; it is
about getting things done rather than just thinking about what needs to be done. Finally, stra-
tegic reward is based upon a philosophy expressed in the form of guiding principles.
<p>Reward philosophy
<p>Strategic reward management is based on a well-articulated philosophy &ndash; a set of beliefs
expressed through guiding principles that are consistent with the values of the organization
and help to enact them. These include beliefs in the need to operate in accordance with the
principles of distributive and procedural justice. Reward strategies in the past have sometimes
focused exclusively on business needs and alignment. Yet unless employees see and experience
fairness and equity in their rewards, the strategy is unlikely to be delivered in practice.
<p>The philosophy recognizes that reward management is a key factor in establishing a positive
employment relationship, one in which there is mutuality &ndash; the state that exists when manage-</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>66 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>ment and employees are interdependent and both benefit from this interdependency. Such a
relationship provides a foundation for the development of a climate of trust.
<p>Guiding principles
<p>A reward philosophy can be expressed through a set of guiding principles that define the
approach an organization takes to dealing with reward. They are the basis for reward policies
and provide guidelines for the actions contained in the reward strategy. Importantly, they can
be used to communicate to employees how the reward system operates and takes into account
their interests as well as those of the business.
<p>Reward guiding principles will be concerned with matters such as:
<p>operating the reward system justly, fairly, equitably and transparently in the interests &bull;
of all stakeholders;
<p>developing reward policies and practices that support the achievement of business &bull;
goals;
<p>rewarding people according to their contribution; &bull;
<p>recognizing the value of everyone who is making an effective contribution, not just the &bull;
exceptional performers;
<p>creating an attractive employee value proposition; &bull;
<p>providing rewards that attract and retain people and enlist their engagement; &bull;
<p>helping to develop a high-performance culture; &bull;
<p>maintaining competitive rates of pay; &bull;
<p>maintaining equitable rates of pay; &bull;
<p>allowing a reasonable degree of flexibility in the operation of reward processes and in &bull;
the choice of benefits by employees;
<p>devolving more responsibility for reward decisions to line managers. &bull;
<p>Examples of guiding principles are given below.
<p>Aegon UK
<p>Aegon UK wishes to:

<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 67
<p>ensure that salaries and benefits remain competitive when compared with comparators &bull;
within our industry sector, so that we can retain and attract staff of the highest
quality;
<p>reduce the previous focus upon grades in favour of broader bands so that personal &bull;
development can be encouraged;
<p>Aegon UK motivate staff sufficiently so that they will ensure the company remains suc- &bull;
cessful, thereby allowing for continued competitive levels of reward for superior per-
formance.
<p>BT
<p>The five key principles of the reward framework at BT are:
<p>Clarity: the reward framework brings transparency to the way people are rewarded for &bull;
their contribution to the business. The same role profiles (within the same job families)
now apply right across BT, and command the same published salary ranges. People
know exactly where they stand.
<p>External focus: the way we reward and recognize people must conform to the market &bull;
in which we operate. Under the new reward framework, salary ranges are now aligned
with the going rate for equivalent jobs across a range of comparable organizations,
geographies and skill sets. This will ensure we remain competitive, and are able to
recruit and retain the people we need.
<p>Focus on roles: a person&rsquo;s place in the organization should be valued by the work they &bull;
do &ndash; not by where they sit in a hierarchy. The new reward framework has replaced
grades with job families, which represent a group of similar roles in a similar field of
activity. A large number of operational managers from across the business have helped
to define a structure that reflects the roles individuals actually do, not historical
grades.
<p>Reward for performance: people who perform well will earn higher rewards than &bull;
people who don&rsquo;t. Reward decisions are now based on capability in role and proven
contributions through achievement of objectives. People should be clear about why
they earn what they do.
<p>Choice: the framework offers an increased choice over the benefits people receive &bull;
as part of their total reward package. This approach ensures that everyone knows
exactly where he or she stands in relation to the market, and in relation to his or
her performance.</p>

<p>Colt Telecom
<p>Colt&rsquo;s reward philosophy states that:
<p>Colt believes that talented and motivated people make a difference; talented people put &bull;
us ahead of the competition and deliver the results on which the success of Colt is built.
Colt seeks to offer a compensation and benefits package that rewards people for their
contribution to the success of the company and ensures that external market competi-
tiveness and internal relativities are taken into account.
<p>The reward mix is designed to promote a performance culture that underpins the &bull;
company business strategy. Reward is geared to driving exceptional effort through the
variable elements of the total package whilst maintaining flexibility, simplicity and
equity within the guiding principles of driving discretionary effort, rewarding employee
contribution and encouraging employees to behave like owners.
<p>The compensation package includes cash and non-cash payments as well as fixed and &bull;
variable elements. The ability to have an impact on shareholder value influences the mix
of the total reward package, with a greater emphasis on variable pay (bonus, share incen-
tive and share ownership schemes) for those at the senior level within the company.
<p>Base salaries are benchmarked regularly across Europe against other telecommunica- &bull;
tion operators, the high-tech sector and other appropriate industries.
<p>The performance management system ensures that performance is assessed and used &bull;
to differentiate achievement among employees at all levels, thus driving discretionary
effort. The bonus scheme rewards individual performance against a mix of company
and individual objectives and contribution to overall company performance.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 69
<p>The company believes in encouraging an ownership mindset, so share option schemes &bull;
offer employees a stake in the organization, which will allow them to share in the com-
pany&rsquo;s success over the medium and long term. Colt offers voluntary, all-employee
share participation schemes in the countries where it is possible to do so. Management
can participate in performance-related option schemes, and it is expected that those
with greater opportunities to influence directly the success of the business will have a
larger proportion of shareholding within their total reward package.
<p>Benefits are designed to be market competitive whilst protecting both employees and &bull;
the company. They comply with local legislation, are tax effective and take into account
social security benefits in all the countries within which Colt operates.
<p>Diageo
<p>Diageo&rsquo;s approach to recognition and reward is based around four key principles:
<p>Performance: rewards are developed that reflect team and individual achievements. &bull;
<p>Market: rewards reflect the market in which an employee is based, whether that be geo- &bull;
graphical or functional, and compare favourably with those of competitors.
<p>Communication: Diageo aims to explain to &lsquo;everyone the components and value of &bull;
their reward package, the criteria that affect it, and how they can influence it&rsquo;.
<p>Effectiveness: the company seeks &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; and ensures its benefits programmes &bull;
&lsquo;remain effective for the business and our employees&rsquo;.
<p>KPMG
<p>The firm&rsquo;s reward philosophy is based on the overarching reward strategy of &lsquo;market-leading
rewards for market-leading performance&rsquo;. It contains six explicit principles that make the
emphasis on rewarding performance very clear. They are:
<p>market-leading bonus for market-leading performance; &bull;
<p>performance-driven reward that is fair and equitable; &bull;
<p>a variable proportion of reward that increases with grade; &bull;
<p>market-competitive salaries; &bull;
<p>competitive benefits, with choice and flexibility; &bull;
<p>people management leaders empowered to make and communicate reward decisions. &bull;</p>

<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 71
<p>Table 4.1 Reward principles for the UK Civil Service
<p>1 Meet business need and be affordable
<p>Business, operational and workforce needs are the drivers for a reward strategy. &bull;
Business cases outline benefits, risks and costs and justify investment. &bull;
Reward arguments need to be sustainable. &bull;
<p>2 Reflect nature of work
<p>Recognize and reflect workforce groups identified by function and skills utilized (eg &bull;
operational, corporate or policy decisions).
<p>Organizations employing similar workforce groups in similar markets are encouraged &bull;
to consider similar reward arrangements.
<p>3 Recognize performance
<p>Reward reflects the continuing value and the sustained contribution of employees and &bull;
their performance in given positions.
<p>Value and performance rewarded reflect how jobholders contribute to their organiza- &bull;
tion, impact delivery and meet professional government (PSG) requirements.
<p>4 Manage total reward
<p>Reward includes all aspects of the &lsquo;employee deal&rsquo;: tangible and intangible elements of &bull;
what is offered.
<p>Total reward is tailored and promoted to attract, engage and retain the right talent as &bull;
well as providing personal choice and flexibility.
<p>Employers/employees need to develop a full understanding and appreciation of the &bull;
value of the total reward package.
<p>5 Manage all cash
<p>Total cash comprises base pay and variable pay. &bull;
Base pay reflects job challenge and individuals&rsquo; competence in their jobs. &bull;
Variable pay reflects performance delivered against agreed objectives. &bull;
<p>6 Face the market
<p>Reward levels, generally and for specific skills, are aligned with agreed market position- &bull;
ing to attract, motivate and retain the right talent.
<p>Reward competitiveness covers each element of total reward (eg base pay, pensions, &bull;
leave) and the overall deal.
<p>Support Equal Pay
<p>Eliminate direct and indirect reward discrimination and reduce any unjustified gender &bull;
pay gaps.
<p>Operate reward systems that are perceived by staff to be reasonable and transparent. &bull;
Reward systems and structures evaluated and kept up to date to ensure that they &bull;
continue to meet the requirements of legislation.</p>

<p>72 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Reward strategy
<p>The process of strategic reward is operationalized through overall or specific reward strategies.
These provide business and people-focused descriptions of what the organization wants to do
about reward in the next few years and how it intends to do it. They generally start with a
review of the current reward arrangements and situation, then a definition of the desired
future state, and the development of reward initiatives and activities to close the gap between
the two.
<p>Aim of reward strategy
<p>The aim of reward strategy is to provide the organization with a sense of purpose and direction
in delivering reward programmes that support the achievement of business goals and meet the
needs of stakeholders. It defines pathways that link the needs of the business and its people
with the reward policies and practices of the organization and thereby communicate and
explain these practices.
<p>Kantor and Kao (2004) elaborate on this description as follows: &lsquo;Reward strategies should
have two primary aims: to articulate a distinctive value proposition that attracts and retains
the right people for the business, and to provide a framework from which the company designs,
administers and evaluates effective reward programmes.&rsquo;
<p>The content of reward strategy
<p>As Helen Murlis (1996) pointed out: &lsquo;Reward strategy will be characterized by diversity and
conditioned both by the legacy of the past and the realities of the future.&rsquo; All reward strategies
are different just as all organizations are different. Of course, similar aspects of reward will be
covered in the strategies of different organizations but they will be treated differently in accord-
ance with variations between organizations in their contexts, business strategies and cultures.
But the reality of reward strategy is that it is not such a clear-cut process as some believe. It
evolves, it changes and it has sometimes to be reactive rather than proactive.
<p>Reward strategy often has to be a balancing act because of potentially conflicting goals. For
example, it may be necessary to reconcile the competing claims of being externally competi-
tive and internally equitable &ndash; paying a specialist more money to reflect market rate pressures
may disrupt internal relativities. Or the belief that a universally applicable reward system is
required may conflict with the perceived need to adopt a policy of segmentation, as described
in Chapter 28.
<p>There are two approaches: 1) a grand design involving the development of overall strategy,
and 2) a focus on one or two specific strategies.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 73
<p>Overall strategy
<p>An overall strategy may cover all aspects of rewards &ndash; valuing roles, the design of grade and pay
structures, contingent pay, non-financial recognition, and pensions and benefits, including
flexible benefits. The aim would be to develop a substantially revised reward system that would
operate as a coherent whole. Alternatively, the strategy may be concerned only with imple-
menting total rewards.
<p>The following are some examples of an overall approach (further examples of total reward
strategies are given in Chapter 3).
<p>AstraZeneca
<p>The reward goals of AstraZeneca are:
<p>everyone to benefit from a common reward programme with the same features; &bull;
<p>draw upon the widest possible pool of talent and to be the &lsquo;employer of choice&rsquo; for &bull;
people already employed within the company, as well as for potential new recruits;
<p>meet varied and changing employee needs by introducing more value, choice and &bull;
flexibility;
<p>win the &lsquo;war for talent&rsquo; by being the first in the industry to offer this level of choice and &bull;
personalization;
<p>promote a culture that values, recognizes and rewards outstanding performance; &bull;
<p>enhance employees&rsquo; commitment to AstraZeneca&rsquo;s objectives so that they deliver their &bull;
personal best.
<p>British Telecommunications
<p>The reward strategy at British Telecommunications (BT) indicates the general direction in
which it is thought reward management at BT should go, with an emphasis on adopting a
more holistic, total reward approach: It states that it will:
<p>Use the full range of rewards (salary, bonus, benefits and recognition) to recruit and
retain the best people, and to encourage and reward achievement where actions and
behaviours are consistent with the BT values.
<p>Centrica
<p>At Centrica, following the merger between British Gas and Enron, the aim of the reward strat-
egy was to:
<p>establish a link between pay and performance; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>74 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>align pay with the market; &bull;
<p>boost teamworking and the creation of a single Centrica culture, rather than to have &bull;
the two cultures of British Gas Trading and Enron;
<p>create a single Centrica Business Services employment contract instead of the two that &bull;
then existed.
<p>The Children&rsquo;s Society
<p>The Children&rsquo;s Society defined its overarching reward strategy as follows: &lsquo;We intend to
develop reward systems which will support our mission and corporate objectives. We will
move towards processes which:
<p>recognize contribution; &bull;
<p>are transparent; &bull;
<p>are owned by line managers and staff; &bull;
<p>reinforce leadership, accountability, teamworking and innovation; &bull;
<p>are market sensitive but not market led; &bull;
<p>are flexible and fair.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>Colt Telecom
<p>The reward strategy of Colt Telecom is expressed as follows:
<p>Base salaries should be determined generally by position against median market, but &bull;
always taking account of personal performance and contribution to business success.
<p>At the senior level there will be greater emphasis on the variable portion of the total package &bull;
including bonus potential and the opportunity to participate in share programmes.
<p>Internal equity is sought by working to ensure that the overall compensation package &bull;
reflects the value and contribution of each job, in relation to other jobs in the organiza-
tion across Europe through the introduction of Colt job levels.
<p>Increases to base salary and variable pay will always be related to the company&rsquo;s ability &bull;
to pay. Compensation must be affordable by the business in relation to its business
success and equitable to its employees, customers and shareholders.
<p>Diageo
<p>The overall objective of the reward strategy at Diageo is to &lsquo;release the potential of every
employee to deliver Diageo&rsquo;s performance goals&rsquo;. The role of the reward strategy comprises
five key elements:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 75
<p>Support and enable the talent agenda. &lsquo;Our role in reward is to help to provide the &bull;
talent the business needs, at the right time, in the right place and for the right price,&rsquo;
said Nicki Demby, Diageo&rsquo;s former Performance and Reward Director. &lsquo;This means
developing reward processes and plans that will hire the best talent, keep it and develop
it. We simply can&rsquo;t buy all the talent that we need to take the organization into its
future. We need to grow our own.&rsquo;
<p>Provide clear principles to enable decision making in the business. By developing clear &bull;
principles, Diageo hopes that when line managers are faced with choices, the right deci-
sions will be more obvious. &lsquo;Less demand will be placed on reward &ldquo;experts&rdquo; in the
business, who can spend more of their time on value creating enhancements to our
processes.&rsquo;
<p>Align the reward approach with Diageo business strategy. The success of the reward &bull;
strategy depends heavily on developing appropriate performance measures in incen-
tives, the cost-effective delivery of reward and consistent processes.
<p>Enable every employee to understand why they get paid what they get paid. &lsquo;We need &bull;
to have a big push on communication,&rsquo; admits Nicki Demby. &lsquo;People do not necessar-
ily understand what they are paid and how we perform. The connection between per-
formance and reward needs to become visceral. As a formal part of each business
review, we are telling people the impact the performance of their business is likely to
have on their pay. It helps people to make the connections between the business deci-
sions that they make and the likely personal impact.&rsquo;
<p>Have a customer service ethic that results in great execution. The reward team&rsquo;s ethic &bull;
is now based on a much greater orientation towards the needs of employees &ndash; its inter-
nal customers. &lsquo;This demands great planning, great communication and great execu-
tion,&rsquo; said Nicki Demby.
<p>Friends Provident
<p>The rationale behind the development of a reward strategy at Friends Provident was the
need to:
<p>match salaries directly to the market; &bull;
<p>give line managers greater accountability for staff salaries and career progression; &bull;
<p>increase the flexibility of pay arrangements at business unit level; &bull;
<p>facilitate a real and fundamental top-down change in corporate culture; &bull;
<p>reward the best performers by paying salaries above the market rate; &bull;
<p>manage salary costs; &bull;
<p>encourage greater accountability by staff for development of their own competencies. &bull;</p>

<p>76 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Kent County Council
<p>The reward strategy is to:
<p>pay people a fair rate for the job and give additional reward for excellent contribution; &bull;
<p>ensure the pay structure is simple, fair, transparent and modern; &bull;
<p>offer a flexible package that meets the needs of a diverse workforce; &bull;
<p>recognize family commitments, provide opportunities for flexible working and &bull;
promote personal fitness and a healthy work&ndash;life balance.
<p>Lloyds TSB
<p>The emphasis at Lloyds TSB is on creating a &lsquo;compelling employment offer&rsquo; &ndash; one that is more
individually focused, tailored to employees&rsquo; needs and interests, and more in tune with the
expectations of a diverse workforce.
<p>Nationwide
<p>At Nationwide the organizational redesign of their reward system emerged from the com-
pany&rsquo;s desire to:
<p>respond to occupational and labour market pressures; &bull;
<p>encourage more flexible working practices; &bull;
<p>streamline operations; &bull;
<p>improve customer service; &bull;
<p>increase skills. &bull;
<p>Tesco
<p>Tesco&rsquo;s overall reward strategy is to:
<p>be on the right side of the competition on total reward, with the reward package being &bull;
above the median;
<p>focus on making reward investment deliver more rather than reducing the size of the &bull;
pot;
<p>reinvest to ensure that every element of reward adds value to the business and is valued &bull;
by staff;
<p>build a simplified, global pay and grading system that enables mobility and flexibility &bull;
and supports the values that are critical to future business growth;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 77
<p>ensure the affordability of the reward package is sustainable, and use Tesco&rsquo;s buying &bull;
power to deliver as much unbeatable value to staff as to customers;
<p>focus on rewarding staff for their contribution in a way that enables them to benefit &bull;
directly from the success they help to create;
<p>ensure more transparency so that the reward package offered by the company is fully &bull;
understood and valued.
<p>Specific reward strategies
<p>Specific reward strategies are more closely focused on one issue, or two or three linked issues
that can be dealt with in a single programme, often over a limited timescale to respond to
pressing needs. Examples of such issues include:
<p>placing reward in a programme for developing a high-performance work system; &bull;
<p>introducing a substantially revised job evaluation scheme; &bull;
<p>conducting a systematic programme for ensuring that as far as possible equal pay for &bull;
work of equal value is achieved;
<p>developing a new grade and pay structure such as a broad-banded, job-family or career- &bull;
family structure;
<p>introducing or revising a contingent pay scheme; &bull;
<p>replacing a traditional performance appraisal scheme with performance management &bull;
processes which emphasize development and motivation;
<p>introducing flexible benefits. &bull;
<p>Examples of more closely focused reward strategies are given below.
<p>The aims of the reward strategy devised by Airbus were to introduce performance pay for all
employees, ensure that its rates were competitive with the external market and deal with
anomalies caused by previous rigidities, such as grade drift brought about by people having to
be promoted to a higher grade to receive additional pay.
<p>The reward strategy at Comet concentrated on developing a comprehensive recognition
scheme, defined as that part of total reward that is not &lsquo;promised&rsquo; and is also typically non-
cash. The aim was to recognize the accomplishment of &lsquo;extra mile&rsquo; performance rather than
everyday performance.
<p>In the Corporation of London, a long-standing job evaluation scheme had decayed and grade
drift (upgradings not justified by a real increase in responsibility) was common. The strategy
was to develop an entirely new job evaluation scheme and use that to help in the design of a
broad-banded job-family structure.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>78 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>When Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham merged to form GlaxoSmithKline (with
100,000 employees worldwide), the organization adopted a new approach to reward that
embodied the new GSK &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; of entrepreneurship, innovation and performance. This stressed
pay for performance and increased the proportion of pay &lsquo;at risk&rsquo;.
<p>In the National Union of Teachers the strategy was to develop a new broad-graded pay struc-
ture. To do this it was necessary to design a new job evaluation scheme as a basis for the struc-
ture.
<p>When Price Waterhouse merged with Coopers and Lybrand to form PriceWaterhouseCoop-
ers, only the former had a flexible benefits plan. Flex had been successful in Price Waterhouse
but the two approaches needed to be harmonized and staff formerly with Coopers and Lybrand
made it clear that they also wanted flexibility, so Choices, its new flexible benefits plan, was
developed for all 20,000 UK employees.
<p>The Shaw Trust, a voluntary organization providing employment for people with disabilities,
had a traditional public sector-type pay scheme &ndash; a spine with progression by fixed increments
related to service. The pressure for the trust to function more like a business than a charity led
to the trustees advocating performance pay. Following extensive analysis and discussion a
strategy emerged to introduce contribution-related pay that, because it was concerned with
both results and competency, was felt to be in tune with the culture of the organization.
<p>The structure of reward strategy
<p>Reward strategies are diverse and so is the structure used by different organizations to define
and present them. Some reward strategies are more complex than others but in one form or
other their structure may contain:
<p>A declaration of intent: the proposed reward developments. &bull;
<p>A rationale: the reasons why the proposals are being made. The rationale makes out the &bull;
business case for the proposals, indicating how they will meet business needs and
setting out the costs and the benefits. It also refers to any people issues that need to be
addressed and how the strategy will deal with them. It includes a clear statement of the
objectives of the strategy and the criteria for success.
<p>A definition of guiding principles: the values that it is believed should be adopted in &bull;
formulating and implementing the strategy.
<p>A plan: how, when and by whom the reward initiatives will be implemented. The plan &bull;
indicates what steps have to be taken and allows for resource constraints and the need
for communications, involvement and training. The priorities attached to each element
of the strategy are indicated and a timetable for implementation drawn up.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 79
<p>Criteria for an effective reward strategy
<p>It supports the achievement of business goals. &bull;
<p>It takes account of the needs of employees as well as those of the organization and its &bull;
other stakeholders.
<p>It is founded on detailed analysis and study, not just wishful thinking. &bull;
<p>It has clearly defined and achievable objectives. &bull;
<p>It can be turned into actionable programmes that anticipate implementation require- &bull;
ments and problems.
<p>It is coherent and integrated, being composed of components that fit with and support &bull;
each other.
<p>It provides a framework within which consistent reward decisions can be made. &bull;
<p>Developing reward strategy
<p>The formulation of reward strategy is best described as a process for developing a sense of
direction, making the best use of resources and ensuring strategic fit. The considerations that
should be taken into account when reviewing and rethinking existing rewards are discussed
below.
<p>Limitations of the formal approach to developing reward strategy
<p>The development of reward strategy has often been described as a logical, step-by-step affair,
the outcome of which is a formal written statement that provides a definitive guide to the
organization&rsquo;s intentions. Many people still believe this and act as if it were the case, but it is a
misrepresentation of reality. In practice the formulation of strategy can never be as rational
and linear a process as some writers describe it or as some managers attempt to make it. There
are limitations to the totally logical model of management that underpins the concept of stra-
tegic reward. In the words of Mabey et al (1998) this is &lsquo;a model of management which is more
rational than is achievable in practice&rsquo;. The temptation is to prescribe specific stages for the
process, but this depends largely on political and social considerations, the organizational
context and the scale and nature of the reward changes involved. Reward strategy is a complex
process that does not and in many situations cannot take place in a sequence of predetermined
steps.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>80 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>It&rsquo;s about evolution not revolution
<p>Reward professionals rarely start with a clean sheet. They have to take note, and keep taking
note, of changes in organizational requirements that are happening all the time. They must
track emerging trends and modify their views accordingly, as long as they do not leap too
hastily on the latest bandwagon. They have to ensure that reward strategy can be implemented
at a pace the organization can manage and people can deal with. The fundamental change in
culture often inherent in such projects takes a lot of time &ndash; and trouble &ndash; to achieve.
<p>It may be helpful to define reward strategy formally for the record and as a basis for planning
and communication. But this should be regarded as no more than a piece of paper that can be
modified when needs change &ndash; as they will &ndash; not as a tablet of stone. Reward strategy, like busi-
ness strategy, is likely to be formulated and re-formulated as it is used. It may emerge over
time in response to evolving situations to become, in the words of Mintzberg (1987), a &lsquo;pattern
in a stream of activities&rsquo;. An HR Director told Duncan Brown and Steven Perkins (2007) that:
&lsquo;We deliberately didn&rsquo;t have a reward strategy, it would have been a nine-day wonder&hellip; we let
it evolve, step-by-step.&rsquo; Brown and Perkins also noted that: &lsquo;Truly strategic reward approaches
are not about supposed best practice or quick fixes or quick wins.&rsquo;
<p>Focus on the context
<p>Developing reward strategy is a matter of thinking about what is likely to work best for the
organization within its context, rather than the &lsquo;next big thing&rsquo;. Will Astill, Reward Manager
of B&amp;Q, explains the thinking behind their reward review:
<p>An overriding theme running through our review was on the desirability of adopting a
strategic approach. It wasn&rsquo;t a case of &lsquo;let&rsquo;s follow the best practice&rsquo;, nor were we lured
into adopting the latest fads and fashions. Taking what someone has done before will
not push you ahead of rivals.
<p>Tim Fevyer, when Senior Manager Compensation and Benefits at Lloyds TSB, had a similar
message: &lsquo;We need to get away from adopting new initiative after new initiative and move
away from a culture of &ldquo;flavour of the month&rdquo;.&rsquo;
<p>Manage the balance
<p>A reward strategy can include all sorts of things. But it is necessary to get the balance right, to
pay attention to the initiatives that are most needed and are most likely to make a difference.
It is also necessary to establish priorities, reflect realities and make the right strategic choices.
If an attempt is made to do too much too soon, or go too far and too fast in one direction,
trouble will ensue. For example, it is necessary to balance the often competing claims of pay </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 81
<p>flexibility against cost control, the devolution of reward responsibilities down the organiza-
tion against consistency across it, internal equity against external competitiveness and indi-
vidual incentives against teamwork.
<p>Keep it simple
<p>Over-complexity is the bane of reward management. It complicates implementation, puts off
the people affected, hampers effective communication and makes the life of line managers dif-
ficult. The history of reward management is littered with examples of &lsquo;the light that failed&rsquo; &ndash;
over-engineered and ambitious plans that did not work.
<p>Think implementation
<p>No reward initiative should be planned without thinking about how it is going to be imple-
mented, what problems might arise and how they will be dealt with. It is particularly impor-
tant to consider the part that will be played by line managers in implementation and whether
they are up to the task. It is also necessary to consider the reactions of people generally &ndash; the
extent to which they might resist change and what can be done about it. Change management
has to be planned; it won&rsquo;t work if it takes place on an ad hoc basis after the event.
<p>Achieve vertical and horizontal integration
<p>One of the most important characteristics of the strategic reward concept is the quest for ver-
tical and horizontal integration as defined at the beginning of this chapter.
<p>Vertical integration
<p>The factors that can make the achievement of vertical integration difficult are:
<p>The business strategy may not be clearly defined. It could be in an emergent or evolu- &bull;
tionary state, which would mean that there would be little or nothing with which to fit
the reward strategy.
<p>Even if the business strategy is clear, it may be difficult to determine precisely how &bull;
reward strategies could help in specific ways to support the achievement of particular
business objectives. A good business case can only be made if it can be demonstrated
that there will be a measurable link between the reward strategy and business perform-
ance in the area concerned.
<p>Even if there is a link, reward specialists have to possess the strategic capability to make &bull;
the connection. They need to be able to see the big picture, understand the business
drivers and appreciate how reward policies and practices can impact on them &ndash; and
none of this is easy.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>82 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Barriers exist between top management and the reward or HR function. The former &bull;
may not be receptive because they don&rsquo;t believe this is necessary, and reward or HR
specialists are not capable of persuading them that they should listen, or do not have
access to them on strategic issues, or lack credibility with top management as a func-
tion that knows anything about the business or should even have anything to do with
the business.
<p>It is up to reward practitioners in their strategic role to overcome these problems by getting to
know what the business is aiming to do and what drives it (this should be possible even when
strategies are &lsquo;emergent&rsquo;), understanding just how reward practices make an impact, and
achieving access to strategic business decision making by demonstrating their credibility as an
integral part of the management of the business.
<p>Horizontal integration
<p>The factors that inhibit the achievement of horizontal fit are difficulties in:
<p>deciding which bundles are likely to be best; &bull;
<p>actually linking practices together &ndash; it is always easier to deal with one practice at a time; &bull;
<p>managing the interdependencies between different parts of a bundle; &bull;
<p>convincing top management and line managers that bundling will benefit the organi- &bull;
zation and them.
<p>These can be overcome by dedicated reward professionals but it is hard work.
<p>Examples of vertical and horizontal integration
<p>The following examples of vertical and horizontal integration are derived from case studies
produced by e-reward (2003&ndash;2005).
<p>B&amp;Q summarized the alignment between their business and HR and reward strategies as
shown in Figure 4.1.
<p>In GlaxoSmithKline the business strategy is very different from that adopted by B&amp;Q but,
similarly, it is reinforced by the HR and reward strategies as shown in Figure 4.2.
<p>The integration of strategy at Lands&rsquo; End is shown in Figure 4.3.</p>

<p>Implementing reward strategy
<p>The aim of implementation is to make the reward strategy an operating reality by building the
capacity of the organization to put into practice the proposals worked out in the development
stage. It is always essential to design with implementation in mind.
<p>Issues and problems of reward strategy implementation
<p>A say&ndash;do gap in reward strategy often occurs when the reward strategy as conceived at the
development stage is unrealistic and unduly complex, and implementation is hurried without
adequate pilot testing or analysis of the likely consequences. Problems can be caused by poor
project management, inadequate attention to managing change and neglecting to ensure that
the supporting processes such as performance management are in place. Failure to achieve
acceptance and understanding of the strategy and commitment to it, by involving line manag-
ers, staff and their representatives in the design and testing of processes and by communicat-
ing properly are common reasons for implementation problems. Underestimating the
importance of providing guidance and training to line managers to ensure they are capable of
playing their part in implementing and operating the strategy can also create difficulties.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Strategic Reward 85
<p>Implementing worthwhile, realistic and achievable strategies
<p>Strategy must be implementation orientated. Effective implementation is dependent on good
design, and good design is always concerned with producing something worthwhile that will
work. No initiative should be implemented without examining the return on investment. This
is the foundation for a business case.
<p>Six tips for implementing reward strategy
Define what objectives are to be achieved by the strategy and how its impact &bull;
will be measured.
<p>Create a project plan that sets out what needs to be done, when and by whom. &bull;
<p>Decide what supporting processes will be needed and how they can be made &bull;
available.
<p>Ensure through communication, involvement and training that those involved &bull;
know what they have to, know why they are expected to do it, believe that it is
worthwhile and have the skills to do it.
<p>Establish a change management programme to ensure that the strategy is &bull;
introduced smoothly and deal with the concerns of anyone who may react
negatively to it.
<p>Identify any other likely implementation problems and decide how they will be &bull;
dealt with.

<p>Introduction
<p>International reward management is the process of rewarding people in international or mul-
tinational organizations. It can involve the worldwide management of rewards, not just the
management of expatriates. This chapter starts with a review of the international scene, includ-
ing definitions of what is meant by international and multinational firms and globalization. It

<p>88 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>continues with a review of international reward strategy before dealing in more detail with the
management of rewards for expatriates.
<p>The international scene
<p>The international scene is composed of international and multinational firms working in the
context of globalization.
<p>International firms are those in which operations take place in subsidiaries overseas that rely
on the business expertise or manufacturing capacity of the parent company. They offer prod-
ucts or services that are rationalized and standardized to enable production or provision to be
carried out locally in a cost-efficient way. Perkins and Hendry (1999) state that international
firms seem to be polarizing around two organizational approaches: a) regionalization, where
local customer service is important, or b) global business streams that involve setting up cen-
trally controlled business segments that deal with a related range of products worldwide.
<p>Multinational firms are those in which a number of businesses in different countries are
managed as a whole from the centre. The degree of autonomy they have will vary and the sub-
sidiaries are not subject to rigid control except over the quality and presentation of the product
or service. They rely on the technical know-how of the parent company but usually carry out
their own manufacturing, service delivery or distribution activities.
<p>The international scene is linked to the notion of globalization, that is, international economic
integration in worldwide markets. This is defined by the International Monetary Fund (1997)
as &lsquo;the growing economic interdependence of countries worldwide through increasing volume
and variety of cross-border transactions in goods and services, freer international capital flows,
and more rapid and widespread diffusion of technology&rsquo;. Globalization is associated with
easily transferable technology and reductions in international trade barriers. As Ulrich (1997)
has pointed out, it requires organizations to move people, ideas, products and information
around the world to meet local needs. New and important ingredients must be added to the
mix when making business strategy: volatile political situations, contentious global trade
issues, fluctuating exchange rates and unfamiliar cultures.
<p>Firms are being forced to react to these issues in their international resourcing and reward
approaches. A survey by Cendant Mobility (2002) showed that a majority of international
organizations were planning to move more staff between locations to meet their increasingly
global businesses&rsquo; needs and to transfer relevant knowledge and skills. Yet a growing number
also reported increasing difficulty in actually achieving this, with factors such as the growth of
dual-career couples and political instability contributing to an apparent greater reluctance to
move overseas. All these impact on reward strategy.
<p>Traditionally, discussions of international reward strategies and practices have tended to focus
on an elite of expatriate workers, sourced from headquarter locations and rewarded in isolation </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Reward 89
<p>from local country staff. Today a diverse and complex pattern is emerging, requiring a more stra-
tegic approach than simply copying the near-universal practice of other multinationals.
<p>Stephen Perkins (2006) explains that achieving an appropriate &lsquo;global/local&rsquo; balance in inter-
national staffing and rewards has therefore become a much more strategic and challenging
issue for HR and reward managers to address. Major organizations such as BP and The World
Bank have overhauled their policies in recent years to achieve their key strategic reward goals
of mobility and affordability in this more demanding global context.
<p>International reward strategy
<p>International reward strategy is concerned with the development of an integrated approach to
building reward policies and practices across international boundaries. It should be integrated
in the sense that it takes into account the business goals and drivers of the parent company
while at the same time fitting the strategy to the different contexts and cultures across the
globe. The issue of the extent to which the reward strategy should be centralized or decentral-
ized (convergence or divergence) needs to be addressed. The strategy should be based on
guiding principles and should cover all aspects of reward management.
<p>Integration
<p>As White (2005) points out, &lsquo;Best practice tells us that global rewards must not be considered
piecemeal&rsquo;. He also emphasizes that:
<p>The development of any reward programme calls for an integrated approach whereby
each individual element of reward supports the others to reinforce organizational objec-
tives. A global rewards philosophy and total rewards approach can facilitate alignment
of an organization&rsquo;s rewards with business strategy, focus employees on the business
goals, and reinforce consistent pay practices.
<p>But he also comments that &lsquo;different local market practices, regulations and culture are indi-
cators that a one size fits all system will not be truly effective.&rsquo;
<p>Convergence or divergence: general considerations
<p>An issue facing all international firms is the extent to which their HR policies, including
reward, should either &lsquo;converge&rsquo; worldwide to be basically the same in each location, or
&lsquo;diverge&rsquo; to be differentiated in response to local requirements. There is a natural tendency for
managerial traditions in the parent company to shape the nature of key decisions, but there
are strong arguments for giving as much local autonomy as possible in order to ensure that </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>90 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>local requirements are sufficiently taken into account. These arguments are often expressed in
the phrase: &lsquo;Think globally but act locally.&rsquo;
<p>As noted by Adler and Ghader (1990) organizations have to follow very different HR policies
and practices according to the relevant stage of their international corporate evolution: domes-
tic, international, multinational and global. Harris and Brewster (1999) refer to this as &lsquo;the
global/local dilemma&rsquo;, the issue being the extent to which operating units across the world are
to be differentiated and at the same time integrated, controlled and coordinated. They suggest
that the alternative strategies are the global approach in which the company&rsquo;s culture predom-
inates and HRM is centralized and relatively standardized (an &lsquo;ethnocentric&rsquo; policy), or the
decentralized approach in which HRM responsibility is devolved to subsidiaries. They state
that the factors affecting this choice are:
<p>the extent to which there are well-defined local norms; &bull;
<p>the degree to which an operating unit is embedded in the local environment; &bull;
<p>the strength of the flow of resources &ndash; finance, information and people &ndash; between the &bull;
parent and the subsidiary;
<p>the orientation of the parent to control; &bull;
<p>the nature of the industry &ndash; the extent to which it is primarily a domestic industry at &bull;
local level;
<p>the specific organizational competences including HRM that are critical for achieving &bull;
competitive advantage in a global environment.
<p>Chris Brewster (2004) believes that convergence may be increasing as a result of the power of
the markets, the importance of cost, quality and productivity pressures, the emergence of
transaction cost economies and the development of like-minded international cadres. The
widespread practice of benchmarking &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; may have contributed to convergence.
<p>However, Brewster considers that European firms at least are so locked into their respective
national institutional settings that no common model is likely to emerge in the foreseeable
future. Since HR systems reflect national institutional contexts and cultures, they do not
respond readily to the imperatives of technology or the market. Managers in each country
operate within a national institutional context and share a set of cultural assumptions. Neither
institutions nor cultures change quickly, and they rarely change in ways that are the same as
those of other countries. As Hofstede (1980) emphasizes, it follows that managers in one
country behave in a way that is noticeably different from those in other countries.
<p>Laurent (1986) proposes that a truly international approach to human resource management
would require the following steps:
<p>1. An explicit recognition by the parent organization that its own peculiar ways of managing
human resources reflect some of the assumptions and values of its home culture.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Reward 91
<p>2. An explicit recognition by the parent organization that its peculiar ways are neither uni-
versally better or worse than others but are different and likely to exhibit strengths and
weaknesses, particularly abroad.
<p>3. An explicit recognition by the parent organization that its foreign subsidiaries may have
other preferred ways of managing people that are neither intrinsically better nor worse
but could possibly be more effective locally.
<p>4. A willingness from headquarters not only to acknowledge cultural differences, but also to
take active steps in order to make them discussable and therefore useable.
<p>5. The building of a genuine belief by all parties that more creative and effective ways of
managing people could be developed as a result of cross-cultural learning.
<p>These principles apply equally well to reward management and are useful criteria to apply
when deciding on the degree of centralization (convergence) or decentralization (divergence)
that should be adopted.
<p>Convergence or divergence in reward policy and practice
<p>The reward strategy should clarify the extent to which reward policy and practice should con-
verge or diverge internationally. There are four levels, as set out in Table 5.1.
<p>Table 5.1 Levels of convergence and divergence of reward policies and practices
<p>Level 1:
Total
convergence
<p>Central reward policies and practices have to be followed by each operating
unit. These may include a standard job evaluation scheme, uniform grade
and pay structure (with scope for local market differentiation), a common
approach to incentives and a common set of benefits.
<p>Level 2:
Partial
convergence
<p>Central reward policies are applied in some but not all aspects of reward
management. Centralization may be limited to senior management or
international staff (expatriates or nationals from countries other than the
parent company working in the local country &ndash; third country nationals).
Reward policies and practices for local nationals are decentralized.
<p>Level 3:
Partial
divergence
<p>Corporate job evaluation schemes and grade structures are recommended
but modification is permitted to fit local conditions. However, all locations
are expected to comply with the international guiding principles for
reward. There may still be centralized policies for senior managers,
expatriates, and third country nationals, and some benefits may be stand-
ardized. But pay levels and pay progression and incentive arrangements are
determined locally.
<p>Level 4:
Total
divergence
<p>Local companies have complete freedom to develop and apply their own
reward policies and practices, although they may be made aware of the
international guiding principles.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>92 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Guiding principles for international reward
<p>Guiding principles for international reward can be set out under the following policy
headings:
<p>the importance attached to a total rewards approach; &bull;
<p>the use of job evaluation to provide for internal equity; &bull;
<p>the relationship between levels of pay in the local company and local market rates; &bull;
<p>the degree of flexibility present in grade and pay structures; &bull;
<p>the scope for pay progression; &bull;
<p>the importance attached to paying for contributions; &bull;
<p>the use of variable pay &ndash; short, medium and long-term incentives; &bull;
<p>the use of forms of recognition other than pay; &bull;
<p>the use of flexible benefits; &bull;
<p>the basis upon which expatriates and third country nationals should be paid. &bull;
<p>The content of international reward strategy
<p>International reward strategy may cover the areas included in the guiding principles, namely:
total reward, job evaluation, market pricing grade and pay structures, contingent pay, benefits
and remuneration of expatriates and third-country nationals.
<p>Rewards for expatriates
<p>As businesses expand globally, they tend to send an increasing number of staff abroad as expa-
triates. The assignment may be a short-term attachment to provide guidance and expertise, or
it may be a secondment to an overseas location that lasts two or three years. Managing expatri-
ates presents a number of problems: for example persuading people to work in possibly
unpleasant or even dangerous countries, convincing them that an overseas assignment is a
good career move, dealing with the issues raised by the partners of employees who do not want
their career or life at home disrupted, and coping with the fact that on returning to their home
country, expatriates often find that their real earnings have fallen. A particularly difficult
problem is that of remuneration (pay, benefits and allowances) and the approaches available
to solving it are considered below.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Reward 93
<p>Expatriate remuneration policies
<p>Expatriate remuneration policies may be based on the following propositions:
<p>Expatriates should not be worse off as a result of working abroad, neither should they &bull;
be significantly better off for doing essentially the same job although they may be com-
pensated for the extra demands made overseas or for the living and working conditions
there.
<p>Home country living standards should be maintained as far as possible. &bull;
<p>Higher responsibility should be reflected in the salary paid (this may be a notional &bull;
home salary).
<p>The remuneration package should be competitive. &bull;
<p>In developing the remuneration package, particular care has to be taken to giving &bull;
proper consideration to the conditions under which the employee will be working
abroad.
<p>Account should be taken of the need to maintain equity as far as possible in remunera- &bull;
tion between expatriates, some of whom will be from different countries.
<p>Account also has to be taken of the problems that may arise when expatriates are paid &bull;
more than nationals in the country in which they are working who are in similar jobs.
<p>The package should be cost effective; in other words, the contribution made by expatri- &bull;
ates should justify the total cost of maintaining them abroad &ndash; assignment costs can
total three or four times the equivalent package in the home country.
<p>Expatriate pay
<p>There are four approaches to calculating expatriate pay: home country, host country, selected
country and hybrid.
<p>Home-country basis
<p>The home based method (sometimes called the balance sheet approach) &lsquo;builds up&rsquo; the salary
to be paid to the expatriate in the following steps:
<p>1. Determine the salary that would be paid for the expatriate&rsquo;s job in the home country, net
of income tax and National Insurance contributions.
<p>2. Calculate the &lsquo;home country spendable&rsquo; or &lsquo;net disposable&rsquo; income. This is the portion of
income used for day-to-day expenditure at home.
<p>3. Apply a cost of living index to the &lsquo;host country expendable income&rsquo; to give the equivalent
buying power in the host country. This is used as a measure of expenditure levels in the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>94 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>host country and is an important yardstick that is used to ensure that the expatriate will
be no worse off abroad than at home.
<p>4. Add extra allowances for working abroad (see below).
<p>This is the most popular approach.
<p>Host-country basis
<p>This involves paying the market rate for the job in the host country. Allowances may be paid
for the expenditure incurred by expatriates because they are living abroad, such as second
home costs and children&rsquo;s education.
<p>Selected-country basis
<p>The salary structure in a selected country (often where the company&rsquo;s headquarters are sited)
provides the base and this is built up as in the home country method.
<p>Hybrid basis
<p>This approach divides the expatriate&rsquo;s salary into two components. One &ndash; the local compo-
nent &ndash; is the same for all expatriates working in jobs at the same level irrespective of their
country of origin. The other local component is based on a calculation of the spendable income
in the host country required to maintain a UK standard of living.
<p>Choice of approach
<p>The choice is often between the two most popular approaches &ndash; the home and host-based
methods. Their advantages and disadvantages are set out in Table 5.2.
<p>The choice will depend upon the organization&rsquo;s convergence or divergence strategy. To a large
extent it also depends on how important it is to encourage people to work overseas for limited
duration assignments, and how much importance is attached to ensuring the motivation and
commitment of the host country staff.
<p>Allowances
<p>Companies add a number of allowances, as described below, to the expatriate&rsquo;s salary to cal-
culate the total expatriate remuneration package. They are designed to compensate for disrup-
tion and to make the assignment attractive to the employee. Most are applied to the notional
home salary but one of them, the cost-of-living allowance, is based on spendable income.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>International Reward 95
<p>Table 5.2 Advantages and disadvantages of the home and host-based methods of paying
<p>expatriates
<p>Method Advantages Disadvantages
<p>Home-based Ensures that expatriates do not &bull;
lose out by working abroad.
<p>Easy to communicate to &bull;
expatriates.
<p>Easier to slot back into home &bull;
country salary on return.
<p>Particularly appropriate for &bull;
shorter assignments after which
the employee will return home.
<p>Expatriates may be paid signifi- &bull;
cantly more than local nationals
doing the same jobs, thereby
causing dissatisfaction and
possible friction.
<p>In effect there will be two reward &bull;
systems in the same country,
which can cause confusion.
<p>Host-based Avoids the possible dissatisfac- &bull;
tion and friction which can arise
when expatriates are paid
significantly more than local
nationals doing the same jobs.
<p>Enables one coherent pay system &bull;
to be maintained.
<p>Expatriates might lose out, &bull;
making it more difficult to
persuade people to work abroad.
<p>May be harder to assimilate &bull;
expatriates back into their own
country&rsquo;s pay systems.
<p>Cost-of-living-allowance: the cost-of-living allowance is reached by applying an index &bull;
to the home country spendable income. The index measures the relative cost, in the
host country, of purchasing conventional &lsquo;shopping basket&rsquo; items such as food and
clothing.
<p>Incentive premium: this offers the expatriate a financial inducement to accept the assign- &bull;
ment. It may be intended to compensate for disruption to family life. But companies are
tending to reduce this premium or do away with it altogether, particularly for intra-Euro-
pean assignments. They are questioning why an employee should receive 10&ndash;15 per cent
of gross salary for simply moving from one culturally similar country to another when no
such allowance would be payable in the case of a relocation within the UK.
<p>Hardship allowance: this compensates for discomfort and difficulty in the host country &bull;
such as an unpleasant climate, health hazards, poor communications, isolation, lan-
guage difficulties, risk and poor amenities.
<p>Separation allowance: this may be paid if expatriates cannot take their family abroad. &bull;
<p>Clothing allowance: a payment for special clothing and accessories that expatriates &bull;
need to buy.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>96 Essentials of Reward Management
<p>Relocation allowance: this covers the cost of expenses arising when moving from one &bull;
country to another.
<p>Housing/utilities: any additional costs of accommodation or utilities. &bull;
<p>Benefits
<p>The benefits provided to expatriates include cars, the costs of educating children, home leave,
rest and recuperation leave if the expatriate is working in a high hardship territory.
<p>International reward: six tips
Decide on the extent to which you want international reward policies to be &bull;
uniformly based on those in headquarters or varied in different countries (a
convergence or divergence policy).
<p>If the policy is inclined to convergence, decide what elements of corporate &bull;
reward policy and practice you want to be applied internationally.
<p>If the policy is inclined to divergence, decide what guiding principles, if any, &bull;
you wish to be adopted in overseas territories.
<p>Take steps to ensure that managements in overseas territories are capable of &bull;
applying the central policies or following the guidelines, and monitor how these
policies and guidelines are implemented.
<p>Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each method of rewarding &bull;
expatriates in different countries and decide on the most appropriate method.
<p>Remember that important aspects of the total reward package for expatriates &bull;
will be their working environment, the existence of family-friendly policies,
career opportunities abroad and when they return and the existence of
satisfactory re-entry policies (job placement and career choice).

<p>102 Performance and Reward
<p>Introduction
<p>Performance management can be defined broadly as the process of taking systematic action to
improve organizational, team and individual performance. It enables performance expecta-
tions to be defined and creates the basis for developing organizational and individual capabil-
ity. For individuals and teams, performance management is associated with both financial and
non-financial rewards.
<p>Organizations exist to meet the needs of their stakeholders. They do this in five ways: first by
delivering high-quality goods and services, second by acting ethically (exercising social respon-
sibility) with regard to their employees and the public at large, third by rewarding their
employees equitably according to their contribution, fourth, in the private sector, rewarding
shareholders by increasing the value of their holdings, as long as this is consistent with the
requirement to meet the needs of other stakeholders, and fifth, ensuring that the organization
has the capability required to guarantee continuing success.
<p>Performance is the key and reward can make a significant contribution to achieving high per-
formance by enhancing engagement, as described in Chapter 7. As Nicki Demby, formerly
Diageo&rsquo;s performance and reward director, told the e-reward researcher (e-reward, 2003a):
&lsquo;Great incentives should be used to drive great business performance. Great performers will
always perform. Great reward programmes can help the whole organization to perform.&rsquo;
<p>Performance also depends on organizational capability &ndash; the capacity of an organization to
perform effectively in order to achieve desired results. These could include sustained compet-
itive advantage and increased shareholder-value in the private sector or high-quality and cost-
effective services in the public and not-for-profit sectors.
<p>The questions that will be answered in this chapter are: What is meant by performance? What
are the factors that influence performance? How can high performance be achieved? How do
rewards help to achieve high performance? What can be done to manage organizational, team
and individual performance?
<p>All these questions relate to the definition in the CIPD&rsquo;s HR Profession Map of what an HR
professional needs to do and know about performance and reward, which is as follows:
<p>Builds a high-performance culture by delivering programmes that recognize and reward
critical skills, capabilities, experience and performance.
<p>The meaning of performance
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary defines performance as: &lsquo;The accomplishment, execution, car-
rying out, working out of anything ordered or undertaken.&rsquo; This refers to outputs/outcomes </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 103
<p>(accomplishment) but also states that performance is about doing the work as well as about
the results achieved.
<p>Performance is indeed often regarded as simply the outcomes achieved: a record of a person&rsquo;s
accomplishments. Kane (1996) argues that performance &lsquo;is something that the person leaves
behind and that exists apart from the purpose&rsquo;. Bernardin et al (1995) believe that: &lsquo;Perform-
ance should be defined as the outcomes of work because they provide the strongest linkage to
the strategic goals of the organization, customer satisfaction, and economic contributions.&rsquo;
<p>Borman and Motowidlo (1993) put forward the notion of contextual performance, which covers
non-job specific behaviours such as cooperation, dedication, enthusiasm and persistence and is
differentiated from task performance covering job-specific behaviours. As Fletcher (2001) men-
tions, contextual performance deals with attributes that go beyond task competence and that
foster behaviours that enhance the climate and effectiveness of the organization.
<p>Performance could therefore be regarded as behaviour &ndash; the way in which organizations,
teams and individuals get work done. Campbell (1990) states that: &lsquo;Performance is behaviour
and should be distinguished from the outcomes because they can be contaminated by systems
factors.&rsquo;
<p>A more comprehensive view of performance is achieved if it is defined as embracing both
behaviour and outcomes. This was well put by Brumbach (1988) as follows: &lsquo;Performance
means both behaviours and results. Behaviours emanate from the performer and transform
performance from abstraction to action. Not just the instruments for results, behaviours are
also outcomes in their own right &ndash; the product of mental and physical effort applied to tasks
&ndash; and can be judged apart from results.&rsquo;
<p>Performance is a complicated notion. As Bates and Holton (1995) emphasize, &lsquo;Performance is
a multi-dimensional construct.&rsquo; It has been pointed out by Campbell et al (1993) that the
components of performance are: 1) job-specific task proficiency, 2) non-job-specific profi-
ciency (eg organizational citizenship behaviour), 3) written and oral communication profi-
ciency, 4) demonstration of effort, 5) maintenance of personal discipline, 6) facilitation of
peer and team performance, 7) supervision/leadership, and 8) management/administration.
<p>This concept of performance leads to the conclusion that when managing the performance of
teams and individuals a number of factors have to be considered, including both inputs
(behaviour) and outputs (results).
<p>Influences on performance
<p>The performance of individuals depends on a number of factors as reviewed below, their level
of engagement as covered in Chapter 7, their levels of competency and skill, which can be
developed with the help of a performance management system as considered later in this </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>104 Performance and Reward
<p>chapter, and, importantly, the work system and the quality of leadership they experience as
discussed at the end of this section.
<p>Influences on individual performance
<p>Vroom (1964) suggested that performance is a function of ability and motivation as depicted in
the formula: Performance = ƒ (Ability x Motivation). The effects of ability and motivation on
performance are not additive but multiplicative. People need both ability and motivation to
perform well and if either ability or motivation is zero there will be no effective performance.
<p>A formula for performance was originated by Blumberg and Pringle (1982). Their equation
was: Performance = Individual Attributes &times; Work Effort &times; Organizational Support. By includ-
ing organizational support in the formula they brought in the organizational context as a
factor affecting performance.
<p>Research carried out by Bailey et al (2001) in 45 establishments focused on another factor
affecting performance &ndash; the opportunity to participate. They noted that &lsquo;organizing the work
process so that non-managerial employees have the opportunity to contribute discretionary
effort is the central feature of a high-performance work system.&rsquo; (This was one of the earlier
uses of the term discretionary effort.)
<p>The &lsquo;AMO&rsquo; formula put forward by Boxall and Purcell (2003) is a combination of the
Vroom&rsquo;s and Bailey, Berg and Sandy&rsquo;s ideas This model posits that performance is a func-
tion of Ability + Motivation + Opportunity to Participate (note that the relationship is
additive not multiplicative).
<p>The work system
<p>All these formulas are concerned with individual performance, but this is influenced by
systems as well as person factors. These include the support people get from the organization
and the leadership and support they get from their managers, and other contextual factors
outside the control of individuals. Jones (1995) makes the radical proposal that the aim should
be to &lsquo;manage context not performance&rsquo; and goes on to explain that:
<p>In this equation, the role of management focuses on clear, coherent support for employ-
ees by providing information about organization goals, resources, technology, struc-
ture, and policy, thus creating a context that has multiplicative impact on the
employees, their individual attributes (competency to perform), and their work effort
(willingness to perform). In short, managing context is entirely about helping people
understand; it is about turning on the lights.
<p>It was emphasized by Deming (1986) that differences in performance are largely due to systems
variations. Coens and Jenkins (2002) were even more adamant. They wrote:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 105
<p>An organizational system is composed of the people who do the work but far more than
that. It also includes the organization&rsquo;s methods, structure, support, materials, equip-
ment, customers, work culture, internal and external environments (such as markets,
the community, governments), and the interaction of these components. Each part of
the system has its own purpose but at the same time is dependent on the other parts&hellip;
Because of the interdependency of the parts, improvement strategies aimed at the parts,
such as appraisal, do little or nothing to improve the system.
<p>Leadership
<p>Leadership as provided by line managers is a key factor in improving performance. The con-
sulting firm Hay McBer, as reported by Goleman (2000), found in a study of 3,871 executives,
selected from a database of more than 20,000 executives worldwide, that leadership had a
direct impact on organizational climate, and that climate in turn accounted for nearly one-
third of the financial results of organizations. Research by Northouse (2006) into 167 US firms
in 13 industries established that over a 20-year period, leadership accounted for more varia-
tions in performance than any other variable.
<p>Leadership can be defined as the process of getting people to do their best to achieve a
desired result. This is the job of line managers, who play a crucial role in providing non-
financial rewards (positive feedback, recognition, opportunity to develop and scope to exer-
cise responsibility). They also, of course, have considerable influence on financial reward
decisions &ndash; pay reviews and fixing rates of pay. Importantly, it is they who are largely respon-
sible for operating the performance management system, job design and on-the-job coach-
ing and development. All these activities impact directly on the performance of their teams
and the individuals in them.
<p>Taking action
<p>All these activities are concerned with developing a high-performance culture, as discussed
later in this chapter. Such a culture depends on adopting the right approach to improving
organizational, team and individual performance and getting the work system and leadership
right. This is the responsibility of senior leaders but they can benefit from the advice, guidance
and support of HR in developing performance and reward systems.
<p>How does reward impact on performance?
<p>Reward makes an overall positive impact on performance when it contributes to the develop-
ment of a high-performance culture, one in which the values, norms and HR practices of an
organization combine to create a climate in which the achievement of high levels of perform-</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>106 Performance and Reward
<p>ance is a way of life. Such a culture can be manifested in a high-performance work system.
Within the high-performance culture and work system, reward impacts on individual and
organizational performance by:
<p>focusing attention on the values of the organization for high performance and the &bull;
behaviours required to achieve it;
<p>ensuring that performance expectations are defined and understood; &bull;
<p>providing the means to encourage and recognize high performance; &bull;
<p>enhancing engagement and promoting positive discretionary effort; &bull;
<p>persuading talented people to join and stay with the organization. &bull;
<p>The next four sections of this chapter examine in more detail the concept of a high-perform-
ance culture, the features of a high-performance work system, and the impact of reward on
individual and organizational performance. These sections provide the background to the
final three sections of the chapter, which deal with approaches to developing organizational,
team and individual performance.
<p>High-performance cultures
<p>A high-performance culture is one in which people are aware of the need to perform well and
behave accordingly in order to meet or exceed expectations. Such a culture embraces a number
of interrelated processes that together make an impact on the performance of the organization
through its people in such areas as productivity, quality, levels of customer service, growth,
profits, and ultimately, in profit-making firms, the delivery of increased shareholder value. In
our more heavily service and knowledge-based economy, employees have become the most
important determinant of organizational success.
<p>Characteristics of a high-performance culture
<p>The following characteristics of a high-performance culture were defined by Lloyds TSB
(source: e-reward, 2003b):
<p>People know what&rsquo;s expected of them &ndash; they are clear about their goals and &bull;
accountabilities.
<p>They have the skills and competencies to achieve their goals. &bull;
<p>High performance is recognized and rewarded accordingly. &bull;
<p>People feel that their job is worth doing, and that there&rsquo;s a strong fit between the job &bull;
and their capabilities.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 107
<p>Managers act as supportive leaders and coaches, providing regular feedback, perform- &bull;
ance reviews and development.
<p>A pool of talent ensures a continuous supply of high performers in key roles. &bull;
<p>There&rsquo;s a climate of trust and teamwork, aimed at delivering a distinctive service to the &bull;
customer.
<p>Another important characteristic is the encouragement of discretionary behaviour.
<p>Discretionary behaviour
<p>Discretionary behaviour takes place when employees exercise an element of choice about the
amount of effort, care, innovation and productive conduct they display and how they do their
job. On the basis of their longitudinal research Purcell et al (2003) suggested that the following
conditions were required to achieve this:
<p>Discretionary behaviour is more likely to occur when individuals have commitment to &bull;
their organization and/or when they feel motivated to do so and/or when they gain
high levels of job satisfaction.
<p>Commitment, motivation and job satisfaction, either together or separately, will be &bull;
higher when people positively experience the application of HR policies concerned
with creating an able workforce, motivating valued behaviours and providing oppor-
tunities to participate.
<p>This positive experience will be higher if the wide range of HR policies necessary to &bull;
develop ability, motivation and opportunity are both in place and mutually reinforcing.
<p>The way HR and reward policies and practices are implemented by front-line manag- &bull;
ers and the way top-level-espoused values and organizational cultures are enacted by
them will enhance or weaken the effect of HR policies in triggering discretionary behav-
iour by influencing attitudes.
<p>The experience of success seen in performance outcomes helps reinforce positive &bull;
attitudes.
<p>Developing a high-performance culture
<p>The above prescriptions by John Purcell and his colleagues for encouraging discretionary
behaviour can be applied to the development of a high-performance culture. They are mainly
concerned with general HR policies and approaches to managing people. Overall, there are
three development approaches that can be adopted: 1) the implementation of high-perform-
ance working through a high-performance work system, 2) the use of rewards, and 3) the use
of systematic methods of managing performance, including performance management
systems. These are discussed in the remaining sections of this chapter.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>108 Performance and Reward
<p>High-performance work systems
<p>A high-performance work system (HPWS) is described by Becker and Huselid (1998) as:
&lsquo;An internally consistent and coherent HRM system that is focused on solving operational
problems and implementing the firm&rsquo;s competitive strategy&rsquo;. They suggest that such a
system &lsquo;is the key to the acquisition, motivation and development of the underlying intel-
lectual assets that can be a source of sustained competitive advantage&rsquo;. This is because it has
the following characteristics:
<p>It links the firm&rsquo;s selection and promotion decisions to validated competency models. &bull;
<p>It is the basis for developing strategies that provide timely and effective support for the &bull;
skills demanded to implant the firm&rsquo;s strategies.
<p>It enacts compensation and performance management policies that attract, retain and &bull;
motivate high-performance employees.
<p>High-performance work systems provide the means for creating a performance culture. They
embody ways of thinking about performance in organizations and how it can be improved.
They are concerned with developing and implementing bundles of complementary practices
that as an integrated whole will make a much more powerful impact on performance than if
they were dealt with as separate entities.
<p>Becker, Huselid and Ulrich (2001) have stated that the aim of such systems is to develop a
&lsquo;high-performance perspective in which HR and other executives view HR as a system embed-
ded within the larger system of the firm&rsquo;s strategy implementation&rsquo;. As Nadler (1989) com-
mented, they are deliberately introduced in order to improve organizational, financial and
operational performance. Nadler and Gerstein (1992) have characterized an HPWS as a way
of thinking about organizations. It can play an important role in strategic human resource
management by helping to achieve a &lsquo;fit&rsquo; between information, technology, people and work.
<p>In their seminal work Manufacturing Advantage: Why high-performance work systems pay off,
Appelbaum et al (2000) stated that high-performance work systems facilitate employee
involvement, skill enhancement and motivation. An HPWS is &lsquo;generally associated with work-
shop practices that raise the levels of trust within workplaces and increase workers&rsquo; intrinsic
reward from work, and thereby enhance organizational commitment&rsquo;. They define high per-
formance as a way of organizing work so that front-line workers participate in decisions that
have a real impact on their jobs and the wider organization.
<p>It is sometimes believed that high-performance work systems are just about HR policies and
initiatives. But as Godard (2004) suggested, they are based on both alternative work practices
and high-commitment employment practices. He called this the high-performance paradigm
and described it as follows.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 109
<p>Alternative work practices that have been identified include: 1) alternative job design prac-
tices, including work teams (autonomous or non-autonomous), job enrichment, job rota-
tion and related reforms; and 2) formal participatory practices, including quality circles or
problem-solving groups, town hall meetings, team briefings and joint steering committees.
Of these practices, work teams and quality circles can be considered as most central to the
high-performance paradigm. High-commitment employment practices that have been
identified include: 1) sophisticated selection and training, emphasizing values and human
relations skills as well as knowledge skills; 2) behaviour-based appraisal and advancement
criteria; 3) single status policies; 4) contingent pay systems, especially pay-for-knowledge,
group bonuses, and profit sharing; 5) job security; 6) above-market pay and benefits; 7)
grievance systems; and others.
<p>High-performance work systems are also known as high-performance work practices (Sung
and Ashton, 2005). Thompson and Heron (2005) referred to them as high-performance work
organizations that &lsquo;invest in the skills and abilities of employees, design work in ways that
enable employee collaboration in problem-solving, and provide incentives to motivate workers
to use their discretionary effort&rsquo;. The terms high-performance system, high-commitment
system and high-involvement system sometimes seem to be used interchangeably. There is
indeed much common ground between the practices included in them although, following
Godard (2004), there may be more emphasis in a high-performance work system on alterna-
tive work practices. Sung and Ashton (2005) noted that:
<p>In some cases high-performance work practices are called &lsquo;high commitment practices&rsquo;
(Walton, 1985) or &lsquo;high involvement management&rsquo; (Lawler, 1986). More recently they
have been termed &lsquo;high-performance organizations&rsquo; (Lawler et al, 1998; Ashton and
Sung, 2002) or &lsquo;high-involvement&rsquo; work practices (Wood et al, 2001). Whilst these
studies are referring to the same general phenomena the use of different &lsquo;labels&rsquo; has
undoubtedly added to the confusion.
<p>The term high-performance work system (HPWS) is the one most commonly used in both
academic and practitioner circles and it is therefore adopted in this chapter. But it is recog-
nized that high commitment and high involvement are both important factors in the pursuit
of high performance. The notions incorporated in these practices therefore need to be incor-
porated in any programme for improving organizational capability wherever they add to the
basic concepts of a high-performance work system.
<p>Components of an HPWS
<p>There is no generally accepted definition of an HPWS and there is no standard list of the fea-
tures or components of such a system. Appelbaum and Batt (1994) identified six models:
American lean production, American team production, German diversified quality produc-</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>110 Performance and Reward
<p>tion, Italian flexible specialization, Japanese lean production and Swedish socio-technical
systems. These systems vary in the degree of autonomy they give the workforce, the nature of
the supporting human resource practices, and the extent to which the gains from the systems
are shared.
<p>In spite of this problem of definition, an attempt to define the basic components of an HPWS
was made by Shih et al (2005) as follows:
<p>Job infrastructure: workplace arrangements that equip workers with the proper abili- &bull;
ties to do their jobs, provide them with the means to do their jobs, and give them the
motivation to do their jobs. These practices must be combined to produce their proper
effects.
<p>Training programmes to enhance employee skills: investment in increasing employee &bull;
skills, knowledge and ability.
<p>Information sharing and worker involvement mechanisms: to understand the available &bull;
alternatives and make correct decisions.
<p>Compensation and promotion opportunities that provide motivation: to encourage &bull;
skilled employees to engage in effective discretionary decision making in a variety of
environmental contingencies.
<p>Developing a high-performance work system
<p>A high-performance work system has to be based on a high-performance strategy that sets out
intentions and plans for how a high-performance culture can be created and maintained. The
strategy has to be aligned to the context of the organization and to its business strategy. Every
organization will therefore develop a different strategy, as is illustrated by the case study exam-
ples set out in Table 6.1.
<p>The approach to developing an HPWS is based on an understanding of what the goals and
performance drivers of the business are, what work arrangements are appropriate to the attain-
ment of those goals and how people can contribute to their achievement. This leads to an
assessment of what type of performance culture is required and what approach to reward is
appropriate for the different segments of the workforce.
<p>The development programme requires strong leadership from the top. Stakeholders &ndash; line
managers, team leaders, employees and their representatives &ndash; should be involved as much as
possible through surveys, focus groups and workshops.
<p>A high-performance work system is the basis for developing a performance culture and pro-
vides the framework for managing performance. This is sometimes assumed to be simply con-
cerned with managing individual performance through performance management systems.
But it is also very much about managing organizational and team performance as described</p>

tional management where, as an element in a coherent bundle of HR policies and practices, it
should be.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>112 Performance and Reward
<p>Impact of reward on individual performance
<p>Extrinsic rewards can be used as motivators to improve performance, although they are not
necessarily effective in this role. They can also convey the message that performance is impor-
tant and help to focus on specific aspects of performance that need to be improved. There is
plenty of evidence, as quoted in Chapter 8, that in the right circumstances incentives can make
a considerable impact on performance (a total of 190 studies covered individually or in meta-
analyses). Although, as mentioned in that chapter, it is generally accepted that while extrinsic
rewards can have an immediate and, in the right circumstances, a powerful effect on motiva-
tion and performance, intrinsic rewards can have a deeper and longer-lasting effect.
<p>People can be motivated to achieve certain goals and will be satisfied if they achieve these goals
through improved performance. They may be even more satisfied if they are then rewarded by
extrinsic recognition or an intrinsic sense of achievement. This suggests that performance
improvements can be achieved by giving people the opportunity to perform through job and
work-system design and leadership, ensuring that they have the knowledge and skill required
to perform, and rewarding them by financial or non-financial means when they do perform.
<p>Impact of reward on organizational performance
<p>The assumption is that improvements in organizational performance will follow improve-
ments in individual performance. This sounds reasonable but it is difficult to prove, although
some research has attempted to do this.
<p>The findings of the research conducted by Allen and Helms (2001) were that reward practices
were significant predictors of performance and explained nearly 41 per cent of the variance in
organizational performance. A relatively small number of reward practices explained the bulk
of variability in organizational performance; these were: employee share option plans (ESOPs),
individual-based performance systems, regular expressions of appreciation, and customer-
satisfaction monitoring tied to rewards. Team-based pay, flexible benefits and increased job
autonomy were not significant predictors of firm performance.
<p>A study by Brown et al (2003) explored the relationship between pay policy as indicated by pay
levels and pay structure on organizational performance in 333 general hospitals in the State of
California. The findings were:
<p>Pay-level practices and pay structures interact to affect resource efficiency, patient care &bull;
outcomes and financial performance.
<p>Higher pay levels are associated with greater efficiency. &bull;
<p>There are diminishing returns for pay&rsquo;s effects on employee performance. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 113
<p>No single theory can fully explain how compensation relates to organizational per- &bull;
formance, but the results show support for efficiency theory (the belief that high levels
of pay will contribute to increases in productivity).
<p>Higher wages can compensate for the negative effects of inequitable pay systems. &bull;
<p>Data on pay satisfaction and organizational level outcomes was collected by Curral et al (2005)
from 6,394 public school teachers and 117 public school districts. The findings were that pay
satisfaction was positively related to school district level academic performance and negatively
related to intention to quit.
<p>Research carried out by McAdams and Hawks (1994) supported the premise that performance
reward plans are instrumental in performance improvements, often with calculable returns.
Just under half the companies in the study were able to attach a financial value to their plans.
For these organizations, the value of the performance improvement translated into a 134 per
cent net return on what was paid out to employees (excluding the costs associated with train-
ing, communications and consulting).
<p>Managing organizational performance
<p>The management of organizational performance takes place on a number of dimensions. It is a
strategic approach that has to take account of the needs of multiple stakeholders. It is the prime
responsibility of top management who plan, organize, monitor and control activities and provide
leadership to achieve strategic objectives and satisfy the needs and requirements of stakeholders.
<p>As Gheorghe and Hack (2007) observe: &lsquo;Actively managing performance is simply running a
business &ndash; running the entire business as one entity. It&rsquo;s a continuous cycle of planning, exe-
cuting, measuring results and planning the next actions. In the context of a larger strategic
initiative, that means continuous improvement.&rsquo;
<p>Organizational capability
<p>The aim of managing organizational performance is to increase organizational capability, the
capacity of an organization to function effectively. It is about the ability of an organization to
guarantee high levels of performance, achieve its purpose (sustained competitive advantage in
a commercial business), deliver results and, importantly, meet the needs of its stakeholders. It
is concerned with the organization as a system and is in line with the belief expressed by Coens
and Jenkins (2002) that to &lsquo;focus on the overall &ldquo;system&rdquo; of the organization yields better
results than trying to get individual employees to improve their performance&rsquo;.
<p>The aim is to increase organizational effectiveness by obtaining better performance from
people, getting them to work well together, improving organizational processes such as the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>114 Performance and Reward
<p>formulation and implementation of strategy, the achievement of high quality and levels of
customer service, and facilitating the management of change.
<p>This has to take place in a context in which organizations are increasingly embracing a new
management culture based on inclusion, involvement and participation, rather than on the
traditional command, control and compliance paradigm, which Flaherty (1999) claims &lsquo;cannot
bring about the conditions and competence necessary to successfully meet the challenges of
endless innovation; relentless downsizing, re-engineering, and multicultural working holisti-
cally&rsquo;. This new management paradigm requires the development of a high-performance work
environment through management practices that value and support achievement, growth and
learning. It also calls for facilitative behaviours that focus on employee empowerment, learn-
ing and development. In other words, it needs performance management.
<p>The dimensions of managing organizational performance
<p>Sink and Tuttle (1990) stated that managing organizational performance includes five
dimensions:
<p>creating visions for the future; &bull;
<p>planning: determining the present organizational state, and developing strategies to &bull;
improve that state;
<p>designing, developing and implementing improvement interventions; &bull;
<p>designing, redesigning, developing, and implementing measurement and evaluation &bull;
systems;
<p>putting cultural support systems in place to reward and reinforce progress. &bull;
<p>A strategic approach to managing organizational performance means taking a broad and long-
term view of where the business is going and managing performance in ways that ensure that
this strategic thrust is maintained. The objective is to provide a sense of direction in an often
turbulent environment, so that the business needs of the organization and the individual and
collective needs of its employees can be met by the development and implementation of inte-
grated systems for managing and developing performance.
<p>Implementing organizational performance management
<p>Organizational performance management systems are strategic in the sense that they are
aligned to the business strategy of the organization and support the achievement of its strate-
gic goals. They will focus on developing work systems and the working environment as well as
developing individuals. To develop the systems and make them function effectively it is neces-
sary to ensure that the strategy is understood, including, as Kaplan and Norton (2000) put it:
&lsquo;The crucial but perplexing processes by which intangible assets will be converted into tangible </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 115
<p>outcomes&rsquo;. The notion of mapping strategy was originated by them as a development of their
concept of the balanced scorecard. Strategy maps show the cause-and-effect links by which
specific improvements create desired outcomes. They are means of describing the elements of
the organization&rsquo;s systems and their interrelationships. They therefore provide a route map
for systems improvement, leading to performance improvement. In addition, they give
employees a clear line of sight into how their jobs are linked to the overall objectives of the
organization and provide a visual representation of a company&rsquo;s critical objectives and the
relationships between them that drive organizational performance. Bourne et al (2003) call
them &lsquo;success maps&rsquo; which they describe as diagrams that show the logic of how the objectives
of the organization interact to deliver overall performance. An example of a strategy map is
given in Figure 6.1.

<p>116 Performance and Reward
<p>This map shows an overall objective to improve profitability as measured by return on capital
employed. In the next line the map indicates that the main contributors to increased profita-
bility are increases to the gross margin (the difference between the value of sales and the cost
of sales), improvements to operational capability and better cost management. At the next
level down the objective is to increase sales turnover in order to increase the gross margin.
How this is to be achieved is set out in the next group of objectives and their interconnections,
comprising increases in customer satisfaction and sales force effectiveness, innovations in
product/market development and marketing, and improvements in customer service and
quality levels. The key objective of improving operational capability is underpinned by devel-
opments in high-performance working and the contribution of the organization&rsquo;s human
capital. The latter is supported by human resource management objectives in the fields of per-
formance management, reward management, talent management, levels of employee engage-
ment, and learning and development.
<p>The overall objective of increasing profitability in this example addresses the concerns of only
one section of the stakeholders of an organization, namely the investors. This need would
probably be given precedence by many quoted companies. But there are other objectives that
they could and should have that relate to their other stakeholders, for example those related to
corporate social responsibility. These could be catered for in separate strategy maps. Better
still, they could be linked to their commercial objectives. Public and voluntary sector organi-
zations will certainly have objectives that relate to all their stakeholders as well as their overall
purpose. A stakeholder approach to strategic performance management is required.
<p>The performance prism
<p>A multiple stakeholder framework for organizational performance management &ndash; the per-
formance prism &ndash; has been formulated by Neely et al (2002). This framework is based on the
proposition that organizations exist to satisfy their stakeholders, and their wants and needs
should be considered first. Neely et al contend that companies in particular must assume a
broader role than simply delivering value to their shareholders. To be successful over time,
even for and on behalf of shareholders, businesses must address multiple stakeholders. If com-
panies do not give each of these the right level of focus, both their corporate reputation and
their market capitalization &ndash; and therefore shareholder value &ndash; are likely to suffer in one way
or another. They suggest that the performance prism can facilitate or structure the analysis of
multiple stakeholders in preparation for applying performance measurement criteria.
<p>They explain the term &lsquo;performance prism&rsquo; as follows: &lsquo;A prism refracts light. It illustrates the
hidden complexity of something as apparently simple as white light. So it is with the Perform-
ance Prism. It illustrates the true complexity of performance measurement and management.
It is a thinking aid which seeks to integrate five related perspectives and provide a structure
that allows executives to think through the answers to five fundamental questions:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 117
<p>1. Stakeholder Satisfaction: Who are our stakeholders and what do they want and need?
<p>2. Stakeholder Contribution: What do we want and need from our stakeholders?
<p>3. Strategies: What strategies do we need to put in place to satisfy these wants and needs?
<p>4. Processes: What processes do we need to put in place to satisfy these wants and needs?
<p>5. Capabilities: What capabilities &ndash; people, practices, technology and infrastructure &ndash; do we
need to put in place to allow us to operate our processes more effectively and efficiently?&rsquo;
<p>Managing team performance
<p>As Purcell et al (1998) pointed out, teams supply the &lsquo;elusive bridge between the aims of the indi-
vidual employee and the objectives of the organization... teams can provide the medium for
linking employee performance targets to the factors critical to the success of the business.&rsquo;
<p>Managing team performance involves the key activities of setting work and process objectives,
and conducting team reviews and individual reviews, which are described below.
<p>Setting work objectives
<p>Work objectives for teams should be based on an analysis of the purpose of the team and its
accountabilities for achieving results. Targets and standards of performance should be dis-
cussed and agreed by the team as a whole. These may specify what individual members are
expected to contribute. Project teams will agree project plans that define what has to be done,
who does it, the standards expected and the timescale.
<p>Setting process objectives
<p>Process objectives are defined by the team getting together and agreeing how the members
should conduct themselves as a team under headings related to team competencies including:
<p>interpersonal relationships; &bull;
<p>the quality of participation and collaborative effort and decision making; &bull;
<p>the team&rsquo;s relationships with internal and external customers; &bull;
<p>the capacity of the team to plan and control its activities; &bull;
<p>the ability of the team and its members to adapt to new demands and situations; &bull;
<p>the flexibility with which the team operates; &bull;
<p>the effectiveness with which individual skills are used; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>118 Performance and Reward
<p>the quality of communications within the team and between the team and other teams &bull;
or individuals.
<p>Team performance reviews
<p>Team performance review meetings analyse and assess feedback and control information on
their joint achievements against objectives and project plans. The agenda for such meetings
could be as follows:
<p>General feedback review: &bull;
<p>progress of the team as a whole; &ndash;
<p>problems encountered by the team that have caused difficulties or hampered &ndash;
progress;
<p>helps and hindrances to the operation of the team. &ndash;
<p>Work reviews: &bull;
<p>how well the team has functioned; &ndash;
<p>review of the individual contribution made by each team member &ndash; ie peer &ndash;
review (see below);
<p>discussion of any new problems encountered by individual team members. &ndash;
<p>Group problem solving: &bull;
<p>analysis of reasons for any shortfalls or other problems; &ndash;
<p>agreement of what needs to be done to solve them and prevent their &ndash;
re-occurrence.
<p>Update objectives: &bull;
<p>review of new requirements, opportunities or threats; &ndash;
<p>amendment and updating of objectives and project plans. &ndash;
<p>Managing individual performance
<p>Individual performance is developed through performance management systems, which play
an important part in performance and reward management. They provide the framework for
improving performance through the agreement of performance expectations and the formu-
lation of performance development plans. As vehicles for feedback and recognition they have
a major role in a performance and reward system. They inform contingent pay decisions.</p>

<p>Performance Management and Reward 119
<p>This section starts with definitions of performance management strategy and the purpose and
principles of performance management. Summaries of the processes involved follow. It ends
with descriptions of how performance management functions as a rewarding process, how it
relates to pay and the use of ratings.
<p>Performance management strategy
<p>Performance management strategy is based on the resource-based view that it is the strategic
development of the organization&rsquo;s rare, hard to imitate and hard to substitute human resources
that produces its unique character and creates competitive advantage. The strategic goal will
be to &lsquo;create firms which are more intelligent and flexible than their competitors&rsquo; (Boxall,
1996) by developing more talented staff and by extending their skills base, and this is exactly
what performance management aims to do.
<p>The purpose of performance management
<p>The purpose of performance management is to get better results from the organization, teams
and individuals by understanding and managing performance within an agreed framework of
planned goals, standards and competency requirements. It is a process for establishing shared
understanding about what is to be achieved, and an approach to managing and developing
people in a way that increases the probability that it will be achieved in the short and longer
term. It is owned and driven by line management. Performance management enhances the
engagement of people by providing the foundation upon which many non-financial motiva-
tion approaches can be built.
<p>Principles of performance management
<p>The extensive research conducted by the CIPD (Armstrong and Baron, 1998, 2004) identified
10 principles of performance management as stated by practitioners:
<p>&lsquo;A management tool which helps managers to manage.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Driven by corporate purpose and values.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;To obtain solutions that work.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Only interested in things you can do something about and get a visible improvement.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Focus on changing behaviour rather than paperwork.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s about how we manage people &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a system.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Performance management is what managers do: a natural process of management.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Based on accepted principle but operates flexibly.&rsquo; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Focus on development not pay.&rsquo; &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Success depends on what the organization is and needs to be in its performance &bull;
culture.&rsquo;
<p>The performance management cycle
<p>Performance management is a natural process of management. It is not an HRM technique or
tool. As a natural process of management, the performance management cycle as shown in
Figure 6.2 corresponds with William Deming&rsquo;s (1986) Plan&ndash;Do&ndash;Check&ndash;Act model.
<p>plan
<p>monitor
<p>actreview
<p>Figure 6.2 The performance management cycle
<p>The performance management processes taking place in this cycle are:
<p>Plan: agreeing objectives and competence requirements; identifying the required &bull;
behaviours; producing plans expressed in performance agreements for meeting objec-
tives and improving performance; preparing personal development plans to enhance
knowledge, skills and competence and reinforce the desired behaviours.
<p>Act: carrying out the work required to achieve objectives by reference to the plans and &bull;
in response to new demands.
<p>Monitor: checking on progress in achieving objectives and responding to new demands; &bull;
treating performance management as a continuous process &ndash; &lsquo;managing performance
all the year round&rsquo; &ndash; rather than an annual appraisal event.
<p>Review: a &lsquo;stocktaking&rsquo; discussion of progress and achievements, held in a review &bull;
meeting and identifying where action is required to develop performance as a basis for
completing the cycle by continuing into the planning stage.
<p>Key features of performance management
<p>The key features of performance management are that:</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Performance Management and Reward 121
<p>At every stage the aim is to obtain agreement between managers and individuals on &bull;
how well the latter are doing and what can be done jointly to develop strengths and
deal with any weaknesses.
<p>Discussions between managers and individuals take the form of a dialogue; managers &bull;
should not attempt to dominate the process and it should not be perceived as an alter-
native method of control.
<p>Performance management is largely about managing expectations; both managers and &bull;
individuals understand and agree what they expect of one another, thus developing a
more positive psychological contract.
<p>Positive feedback is used to motivate people by recognizing their achievements and &bull;
potential.
<p>The process is forward looking: it does not dwell on the past and the dialogue is about &bull;
what can be done in the future to develop performance and give individuals the oppor-
tunity to grow (this is an important means of motivation).
<p>Performance management is a continuous process, not an annual event; managers and &bull;
individuals are there to manage performance throughout the year.
<p>Performance management as a rewarding process
<p>Performance management, if carried out properly, can reward people by recognition
through feedback, opportunities to achieve, the scope to develop skills, and guidance on
career paths. All these are non-financial rewards that can encourage job and organizational
engagement and make a longer-lasting and more powerful impact than financial rewards
such as performance-related pay.
<p>Performance management is, of course, also associated with pay by generating the informa-
tion required to decide on pay increases or bonuses related to performance, competence or
contribution. In some organizations this is its main purpose, but performance management is,
or should be, much more about developing people and rewarding them in the broadest
sense.
<p>Performance management and pay
<p>Performance management is not inevitably linked to pay, although this is often assumed to be
the case. Only 42 per cent of respondents to the CIPD 2003/04 survey (Armstrong and Baron,
2004) with performance management had contingent pay. The proportion in public sector
organizations was even less &ndash; 29 per cent.
<p>However, those who use contingent pay must have a means of deciding on increases, which has
to be based on some form of assessment. The most typical approach is performance appraisal, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>122 Performance and Reward
<p>which generates ratings to inform contingent pay decisions, often through a formula (a pay
matrix as described in Chapter 28). This may conflict with the developmental purposes of per-
formance management &ndash; the performance review meeting is in danger of focusing on the ratings
that emerge from it and how much money will be forthcoming. Issues concerning development
and the non-financial reward approaches discussed earlier will be subordinated to this preoccu-
pation with pay. Many organizations attempt to get over this problem by holding development
and pay review meetings on separate dates, often several months apart (decoupling). Some try to
do without formulaic approaches (ratings and pay matrices) altogether, although it is impossible
to dissociate contingent pay completely from some form of assessment.
<p>Rating performance
<p>Traditional performance appraisal schemes almost always included some form of overall rating
of performance, and 80 per cent of the respondents to the 2009 e-reward survey of contingent
pay schemes with performance management used ratings. As set out in Table 6.2 there are argu-
ments for the use of rating as a summary of the assessment and to inform performance-related
or contribution-related pay decisions; but there are also powerful arguments against.
<p>Table 6.2 Arguments for and against rating
<p>Arguments for rating Arguments against rating
<p>Ratings let people know where they &bull;
stand.
<p>It is necessary to sum up judgements &bull;
about people.
<p>Ratings give people something to &bull;
strive for.
<p>They provide a basis for assessing &bull;
potential.
<p>They are needed to inform perform- &bull;
ance or contribution pay decisions.
<p>Ratings are likely to be subjective and &bull;
inconsistent.
<p>To sum the overall performance of a person &bull;
with a single rating is a gross over-simplifica-
tion of what may be a complex set of factors
affecting that performance.
<p>It is hard to rate qualitative aspects of &bull;
performance.
<p>To label people as &lsquo;average&rsquo; or &lsquo;below &bull;
average&rsquo; or whatever equivalent terms are
used is both demeaning and demotivating.
<p>Line managers tend not to differentiate &bull;
between ratings.
<p>The use of ratings to inform decisions on &bull;
performance pay or inclusion in a talent
management programme will dominate
performance reviews and prejudice the real
purpose of such reviews, which is to provide
the basis for developing skills and improving
performance.</p>

<p>Performance Management and Reward 123
<p>The most common number of rating levels among the respondents to the 2003/4 CIPD survey who
used them was five (47 per cent of respondents) followed by four (28 per cent of respondents). Tra-
ditionally, five-level scales have been used on the grounds that raters prefer this degree of fineness
in performance definition and can easily recognize the middle grade and distinguish those who fall
into higher or lower categories. Four-level scales are used when it is believed that they avoid the
problem inherent in five-level scales of taking the easy route of rating in the middle of the scale.
Three examples of a five-level scale and two of a four-level scale are given in Table 6.3 below.

<p>Steps to enhance engagement &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>The concept of &lsquo;engagement&rsquo; has become very popular. The term is sometimes used loosely as
a powerful notion that embraces pretty well everything the organization is seeking with regard
<p> 127</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>128 Performance and Reward
<p>to the contribution and behaviour of its employees in terms of levels of job performance, will-
ingness to do that much more by exercising discretionary effort, motivation and identification
with the organization. It is also used in a more specific way to describe what takes place when
people are interested in and positive, even excited, about their jobs and motivated to achieve
high levels of performance. This specific idea of &lsquo;job engagement&rsquo; is distinguished from organ-
izational commitment or engagement, which focuses on attachment to the organization as a
whole rather than to a job.
<p>Reilly and Brown (2008) noted that the terms job satisfaction, motivation and commitment
are generally being replaced now in business by engagement because it appears to have more
descriptive force and face validity. As Emmott (2006) commented: &lsquo;Employee engagement has
become a new management mantra &ndash; and it&rsquo;s not difficult to see why. Engaged employees &ndash;
those who feel positive about their jobs &ndash; perform better for their employers and can promote
their organization as &ldquo;an employer of choice&rdquo;.&rsquo; In this chapter consideration is given to the
meaning of employee engagement (there are different definitions) and the relationship
between reward and employee engagement.
<p>The meaning of employee engagement
<p>The concept of engagement was defined by Gallup (2009) as: &lsquo;The individual&rsquo;s involvement and
satisfaction with as well as enthusiasm for work&rsquo;. Balain and Sparrow (2009) noted that a number
of other well-known applied research and consultancy organizations have defined engagement
on similar lines, often emphasizing the importance of discretionary effort as the key outcome or
distinguishing feature of an engaged employee. An academic definition based on research by
Maslach et al (2001) referred to engagement as: &lsquo;A positive, fulfilling, work-related state of mind
that is characterized by vigour, dedication, and absorption&rsquo;.
<p>The Institute for Employment Studies (IES) (Robinson et al, 2004) defined employee engage-
ment as follows:
<p>Engagement is a positive attitude held by the employee towards the organisation and its
values. An engaged employee is aware of business context, and works with colleagues to
improve performance within the job for the benefit of the organisation. The organisa-
tion must work to nurture, maintain and grow engagement, which requires a two-way
relationship between employer and employee.
<p>The IES model of engagement is shown in Figure 7.1.
<p>Motivation can be defined as goal-directed behaviour, commitment as the relative strength of
the individual&rsquo;s identification with and involvement in an organization, and organizational
citizenship behaviour as &lsquo;innovative and spontaneous activity directed toward achievement of
organizational objectives, but which goes beyond role requirements&rsquo; (Katz and Kahn, 1966).</p>

<p>Other definitions place more emphasis on job engagement as distinct from organizational
engagement or commitment. An engaged employee was defined by Bevan et al (1997) as
someone &lsquo;who is aware of business context, and works closely with colleagues to improve per-
formance within the job for the benefit of the organization&rsquo;. Murlis and Watson (2001) defined
&lsquo;engaged performance&rsquo; as: &lsquo;A result that is achieved by stimulating employees&rsquo; enthusiasm for
their work and directing it towards organizational success. This result can only be achieved
when employers offer an implied contract to their employees that elicits specific positive
behaviours aligned with the organization&rsquo;s goals.&rsquo;
<p>A comprehensive analysis of the concept of engagement was made by Balain and Sparrow
(2009). They distinguished between job engagement and organizational engagement and con-
cluded that:
<p>To understand what really causes engagement, and what it causes in turn, we need to
embed the idea in a well-founded theory. The one that is considered most appropriate
is social exchange theory, which sees feelings of loyalty, commitment, discretionary
effort as all being forms of social reciprocation by employees to a good employer. This
work separates out job engagement from organizational engagement.
<p>Anther perspective on engagement is provided by the Hay Group employee effectiveness
model, which shows how employee engagement and &lsquo;employee enablement&rsquo; combine to
produce employee effectiveness, as shown in Figure 7.2.</p>

<p>Why engagement is important
<p>However it is defined, employee engagement is important to employers because a considera-
ble amount of research indicates that high levels of engagement that result in behaviours such
as maximizing discretionary effort, taking initiative, wanting to develop, or aligning actions
with organizational needs deliver a range of organizational benefits; for example:
<p>Higher productivity/performance: engaged employees perform 20 per cent better than &bull;
the average (Conference Board, 2006).
<p>Lower staff turnover: engaged employees are 87 per cent less likely to leave (Corporate &bull;
Leadership Council, 2004).
<p>Better attendance: engaged employees have lower sick leave levels (CIPD, 2007). &bull;
<p>Improved safety (Vance, 2006). &bull;</p>

<p>The factors that influence engagement
<p>Research cited by IDS (2007) has identified two key elements that have to be present if genuine
engagement in its broadest sense is to exist. The first is the rational aspect, which relates to
employees&rsquo; understanding of their role, where it fits in the wider organization, and how it
aligns with business objectives. The second is the emotional aspect, which has to do with how
people feel about the organization, whether their work gives them a sense of personal accom-
plishment and how they relate to their managers.
<p>Engagement will be affected by work and job design, the quality of life provided by the working
environment and the quality of leadership. A detailed explanation of the antecedents, types
and consequences of engagement by Balain and Sparrow (2009) based on their research is
shown in Table 7.1.

<p>132 Performance and Reward
<p>Enhancing engagement
<p>Financial incentives may increase engagement for some people in the short run, but the great-
est impact on engagement is made by non-financial rewards, especially when they generate
intrinsic motivation through the work itself and the work environment, and when they are
provided by line managers.
<p>Intrinsic motivation
<p>Intrinsic motivation depends on the way in which work or jobs are designed. Three character-
istics have been distinguished by Lawler (1969) as being required in jobs if they are to be
intrinsically motivating:
<p>Feedback: individuals must receive meaningful feedback about their performance, &bull;
preferably by evaluating their own performance and defining the feedback. This implies
that they should ideally work on a complete product/process/service, or a significant
part of it that can be seen as a whole.
<p>Use of abilities: the job must be perceived by individuals as requiring them to use abil- &bull;
ities they value in order to perform the job effectively.
<p>Self-control (autonomy): individuals must feel that they have a high degree of &bull;
self-control over setting their own goals and over defining the paths to these goals.
<p>The approaches to motivation through job design suggested by Robertson and Smith (1985)
are to influence: 1) skill variety, by providing opportunities for people to do several tasks and
combining tasks; 2) task identity, by combining tasks and forming natural work units; 3) task
significance, by informing people of the importance of their work; 4) autonomy, by giving
people responsibility for determining their own working systems; and 5) feedback, by estab-
lishing good relationships and opening feedback channels.
<p>These approaches may be used when setting up new work systems or jobs, and the intrinsic
motivation strategy should include provision for guidance and advice along these lines to
those responsible for such developments. But the greatest impact on the design of work systems
or jobs is made by line managers on a day-to-day basis. The strategy should therefore include
arrangements as part of a leadership development programme for educating them in the
importance of good work and job design and what they can do to improve intrinsic motiva-
tion. Performance management, with its emphasis on agreeing role expectations, is a useful
means of doing this.</p>

<p>Engagement and Reward 133
<p>The work environment
<p>A strategy for increasing engagement through the work environment will be generally con-
cerned with developing a culture that encourages positive attitudes to work, promoting inter-
est and excitement in the jobs people do, and reducing stress. Lands&rsquo; End believes that staff
who are enjoying themselves, who are being supported and developed and who feel fulfilled
and respected at work will provide the best service to customers. The thinking behind the
company&rsquo;s wish to inspire staff is straightforward &ndash; employees&rsquo; willingness to do that little bit
extra arises from their sense of pride in what the organization stands for: quality, service and
value. It makes the difference between a good experience for customers and a poor one.
<p>The strategy also needs to consider particular aspects of the work environment, especially
communications, involvement, work&ndash;life balance and working conditions. It can include the
formulation and application of &lsquo;talent relationship management&rsquo; policies that are concerned
with building effective relationships with people in their roles, treating individual employees
fairly, recognizing their value, giving them a voice and providing opportunities for growth.
<p>Line managers
<p>Line managers play a vital and immediate part in increasing levels of engagement through
leadership. They need help to understand what they are expected to do and to develop the
skills they need. This help can be given through blended learning programmes, which may
include formal training (especially for potential managers or those in their first leadership
role), e-learning, coaching and mentoring.
<p>Performance management can provide line managers with a useful framework in which they
can deploy their skills in improving performance through increased engagement. This applies
particularly to the performance management activities of role definition, performance
improvement planning, joint involvement in monitoring performance and feedback.
<p>Developing engagement policies through reward
<p>Reilly and Brown (2008) contend that appropriate reward practices and processes, both finan-
cial and non-financial and managed in combination, can help to build and improve employee
engagement , and that badly designed or executed rewards can hinder it. Their model based on
research into how reward policies influence performance through engagement is shown in
Figure 7.3.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Financial rewards comprise all rewards that have a monetary value and add up to total remu-
neration &ndash; base pay, pay contingent on performance, contribution, competency or skill, pay
related to service, financial recognition schemes, and benefits such as pensions, sick pay and
health insurance. As explained in Chapter 3 they are the core elements in total rewards.
<p>The management of a reward system requires decisions on levels of pay, how jobs should be
valued, the design and operation of grade and pay structures and the choice of benefits. Such
decisions can be complex and difficult, but the problems pale by comparison with the issues
surrounding the use of financial rewards contingent on performance, contribution, compe-
tence or skill.
<p>Labour economists distinguish between the incentive effect of financial rewards (generating
more engagement and effort) and the sorting effect (attracting better-quality employees). The
fundamental issue is the extent to which financial rewards provide an incentive effect. The
sorting effect is important but creates less controversy, perhaps because it is more difficult to
pin down.
<p>A vociferous chorus of disapproval has been heard on the incentive effect. One of the best-
known and most influential voices is that of Alfie Kohn (1993) who stated in the Harvard Busi-
ness Review that &lsquo;bribes in the workplace simply can&rsquo;t work.&rsquo; He asserted that: &lsquo;Rewards, like
punishment, may actually undermine the intrinsic motivation that results in optimal per-
formance. The more a manager stresses what an employee can earn for good work, the less
interested that employee will be in the work itself.&rsquo; He also claimed that: &lsquo;At least two dozen
studies over the last three decades have conclusively shown that people who expect to receive </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>138 Performance and Reward
<p>a reward for completing a task or for doing that task successfully simply do not perform as well
as those who expect no reward at all.&rsquo; He did not identify these studies. He returned to the fray
in 1998 when he wrote that: &lsquo;Offering workers the equivalent of a doggie biscuit for whatever
we demand is never going to be successful in any meaningful sense.&rsquo;
<p>Jeffrey Pfeffer (1998) concluded in his equally influential Harvard Business Review article &lsquo;Six
dangerous myths about pay&rsquo; that: &lsquo;Most merit-pay systems share two attributes: they absorb
vast amounts of management time and make everybody unhappy.&rsquo;
<p>More recently, Adrian Furnham (2006) asserted that: &lsquo;The idea that better paid people are
more productive and happy is na&iuml;ve and essentially evidence free.&rsquo; And Simon Caulkin (2009)
wrote in his Observer column that: &lsquo;Evidence to show monetary incentives improve perform-
ance is simply non-existent.&rsquo;
<p>On the other hand there is the less audible chorus of those who have collected evidence that
financial incentives do improve performance (seemingly unknown to commentators such as
those mentioned above) and have questioned some of the findings and theories of the research-
ers who have cast doubts on the effectiveness of financial incentives.
<p>Gerhart and Rynes (2003) in their comprehensive review of compensation research noted that
managers may well be confused by the fact that: &lsquo;Researchers often disagree on many of the
most central questions surrounding pay, depending on their disciplinary training, ideological
beliefs and other factors.&rsquo; Amongst the disagreements they instanced was whether or not pay
is a strong motivator of performance.
<p>The aim of this chapter is to present the evidence on the role and effectiveness of financial incen-
tives so as to inform decisions on what can usefully be done about them by means of contingent
pay schemes (as described in Chapter 10) or, if financial incentives are not favoured, other non-
financial methods of rewarding people (as considered in Chapter 9). The chapter starts with a
review of the motivation theories and research that have influenced views about how incentives
work or don&rsquo;t work. To understand the use of financial rewards it is necessary to know about the
role of money and the extent to which it matters to people, and to appreciate the factors that
affect satisfaction with pay, as discussed in the next section of the chapter. Decisions on financial
rewards also need to take account of the many research projects that have studied their effective-
ness, and the following section of the chapter summarizes the major negative and positive
research findings. The next section lists the advantages and disadvantages of financial rewards in
the shape of contingent pay, and the final section sets out criteria for their use. First, however, it
is necessary to consider the difference between incentives and rewards.
<p>Incentives and rewards
<p>There is a strong body of opinion, at least in academic circles, that financial rewards are bad
&ndash; because they don&rsquo;t work and indeed are harmful &ndash; while non-financial rewards are good, at </p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 139
<p>least when they provide intrinsic motivation. But the critics quoted at the beginning of this
chapter and later on are mainly referring to financial incentives. They do not appear to recog-
nize that incentives are not the same as rewards. They can be distinguished as follows:
<p>Rewards offer tangible recognition to people for their achievements and contribution. &bull;
Financial rewards consist of job-based pay, which provides base pay related to the value
of the job, and person-based pay, which provides rewards that recognize the individu-
al&rsquo;s contribution, competence or skill. Rewards can also be non-financial, for example
recognition. If rewards are worth having and attainable and people know how they can
attain them, they can act as motivators.
<p>Incentives are intended to encourage people to work harder and achieve more. They &bull;
are supposed to provide direct motivation: &lsquo;Do this and we will make it worth your
while.&rsquo; Incentives are generally financial but they can take the form of non-financial
rewards such as promotion or a particularly interesting assignment.
<p>If this distinction is not made it may be assumed that financial rewards only exist to provide
an incentive. They may do this or, as the nay-sayers contend, they may not. But financial
rewards can act as rewards in the sense referred to above and may be justified because they are
a form of tangible recognition &ndash; they are a means of informing people that they have done
well, and accord with the reasonable belief that people who do better should be valued more
and rewarded accordingly.
<p>Of course the opponents of financial rewards say that there are better ways of recognizing
people than throwing money at them. They emphasize the power of intrinsic rewards, assert
that extrinsic rewards erode intrinsic interest, claim that money is not so important to people
as the supporters of financial rewards believe and suggest that job satisfaction is not domi-
nated by feelings about pay. These issues are discussed in the next two sections of this chapter,
in the first of which the theories that have influenced the opinions of those dubious about
financial rewards are summarized and in the second the role of money and the relationship
between pay and job satisfaction are considered. These are followed by a review of the research
evidence on the effectiveness of financial incentives, which leads to final sections in which con-
clusions are reached on the case for or against financial rewards, and the factors that lead to
success in the contingent pay schemes that are devised to provide such rewards are analysed.
<p>The theoretical framework
<p>The theoretical framework is based on the concepts of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation.
Extrinsic motivation arises when something is done to or for people to motivate them. Extrin-
sic rewards include pay, praise and promotion. Intrinsic motivation as originally defined by
Deci (1975) is provided by the self-generated factors that influence people to behave in a par-
ticular way or to move in a particular direction. Intrinsic rewards include responsibility (feeling </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>140 Performance and Reward
<p>that the work is important and having control over one&rsquo;s resources), freedom to act, scope to
use and develop skills and abilities, interesting and challenging work and opportunities for
advancement and growth. In the phrase coined by Herzberg (1968), intrinsic rewards arise
from the work itself. It is generally accepted that while extrinsic rewards can have an immedi-
ate and, in the right circumstances, a powerful effect on motivation and performance, intrinsic
rewards can have a deeper and longer-lasting effect.
<p>Financial rewards are, of course, extrinsic rewards and the doubts about them expressed by
commentators such as those quoted at the beginning of this chapter are mainly based on three
motivation theories: Maslow&rsquo;s (1954) hierarchy of human needs, Herzberg&rsquo;s (1957, 1968)
motivation-hygiene theory, and Deci and Ryan&rsquo;s (1985) cognitive evaluation theory. All these
theories downgrade the role of money or extrinsic rewards as motivators. They have been very
influential, especially Maslow and Herzberg, but in some circles the contribution of Deci and
Ryan appears to have had the most powerful effect on, for example, Kohn, Furnham and
Pfeffer.
<p>Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of human needs
<p>Maslow&rsquo;s theory is based on the proposition that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy of
significance. At the bottom of the hierarchy are physiological and safety needs that are best
satisfied by money. Once these basic needs are satisfied individuals progress to &lsquo;higher&rsquo; needs
not associated with money &ndash; social needs, esteem and, ultimately, self-fulfilment, which is
achieved by being engaged in meaningful work.
<p>The problem with this theory is that it was based on interviews with highly creative individuals
and has not been verified by empirical research.
<p>Herzberg&rsquo;s motivation-hygiene theory
<p>Herzberg&rsquo;s theory concentrates on identifying the factors that contribute to satisfaction or dis-
satisfaction at work. He explained that: &lsquo;The factors involved in producing job satisfaction
(and motivation) are separate and distinct from the factors that lead to job dissatisfaction.&rsquo; He
called the latter &lsquo;hygiene factors&rsquo;, using hygiene in the medical sense as being preventative,
because they can cause dissatisfaction and need to be stopped from doing so. But they cannot
produce lasting satisfaction, which means that while financial incentives may motivate in the
short term the effect quickly wears off. In contrast the &lsquo;satisfiers&rsquo; associated with the work itself
(achievement, responsibility, recognition and advancement) have a deeper and longer-lasting
effect on motivation.
<p>Herzberg&rsquo;s two-factor theory has been criticized by Opsahl and Dunnette (1966) who stated
that the data on feelings about pay &lsquo;seem inconsistent with the interpretations and lend no
substantial support to hypotheses of a so-called differential role for money in leading to job </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 141
<p>satisfaction or job dissatisfaction&rsquo;. They contended that Herzberg&rsquo;s research methodology was
flawed because no attempt was made to measure the relationship between satisfaction and
performance and they suggested that the two-factor nature of the theory is an inevitable result
of the questioning method used by the interviewers. Gerhart and Rynes (2003) noted from
Herzberg&rsquo;s (1968) summary of his research that pay was mentioned as a satisfier nearly as
often as it was listed as a dissatisfier It has also been suggested (Schwab and Cummings, 1970;
Kanfer, 1990) that wide and unwarranted inferences have been drawn from small and special-
ized samples and that there is no evidence to indicate that &lsquo;satisfiers&rsquo; act as motivators &ndash; it has
been argued by both Maslow (1954) and Adams (1965) that a satisfied need is no longer a
motivator.
<p>In spite of these criticisms the Herzberg two-factor theory continues to thrive; partly because
it is easy to understand and seems to be based on &lsquo;real-life&rsquo; rather than academic abstractions,
and partly because it convincingly emphasizes the positive value of the intrinsic motivating
factors. It is also in accord with a fundamental belief in the dignity of labour and the Protestant
ethic &ndash; that work is good in itself. As a result, Herzberg had immense influence on the job
enrichment movement, which sought to design jobs in a way that would maximize the oppor-
tunities to obtain intrinsic satisfaction from work and thus improve the quality of working life.
His emphasis on non-financial motivators is also reflected in the concept of total rewards. As
Dunham (1984) commented: &lsquo;Herzberg is living proof that a theory need not be perfect to
make a valuable contribution.&rsquo; The same applies to Maslow.
<p>Cognitive evaluation theory
<p>Deci (1975) defined intrinsically motivated behaviours as &lsquo;those in which there is no apparent
reward except with the activity itself&rsquo;. Deci and Ryan (1985) explained that: &lsquo;Intrinsic motiva-
tion is non-drive-based motivation. It is based on the needs to be competent and self-deter-
mining (that is, to have a choice). It means that a person carries out an activity in the absence
of a reward contingency or control.&rsquo; They analysed evidence from over 100 studies (possibly
those referred to by Alfie Kohn and Jeffrey Pfeffer), which they claimed showed that when
subjects received monetary rewards their intrinsic motivation for rewarded activity declined
because it reduced their self-determination through the shift from internal to external control.
This led to the development of their cognitive evaluation theory (CET).
<p>They pointed out that &lsquo;Rewards, like feedback, when used to convey to people a sense of appre-
ciation for work well done, will tend to be experienced informationally and will maintain or
enhance intrinsic motivation. But when they are used to motivate people, they will be experi-
enced controllingly and will undermine intrinsic motivation.&rsquo; In other words, they were
making the distinction between rewards and incentives referred to earlier in this chapter.
<p>Deci et al (1999) followed up this research by carrying out a meta-analysis of 128 experiments
on rewards and intrinsic motivation to establish the extent to which intrinsic motivation was </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>142 Performance and Reward
<p>undermined by rewards. Meta-analysis is a technique for combining the results of a large
number of conceptually related studies to reach generalizations based on statistical criteria.
What is called a &lsquo;between-groups design&rsquo; is used, in which a rewarded group is compared to a
control group (a non-rewarded group) on a common dependent measure (intrinsic motiva-
tion).The aim is to establish the relation between the independent and dependent variables of
rewards and intrinsic motivation and to determine what factors moderate the size of the rela-
tion (eg type of reward and the basis upon which the reward is given). Relevant studies are
identified and the results of each study are transformed into a measure called an effect size,
which indicates the extent to which the experimental rewarded group and the control non-
rewarded group differ in terms of intrinsic motivation (interest in the task and continuing to
carry it out after the rewards have been removed).
<p>The meta-analysis study conducted by Deci et al focused on the overall effects of rewards on
intrinsic motivation for tasks of initial high interest only, on the grounds that in low-interest
tasks there was little or no intrinsic motivation to undermine. The results of the study indi-
cated that for high-interest tasks, rewards had significant negative effects on what the research-
ers called &lsquo;free-choice measures&rsquo;, which included the time spent on the task after the reward
was removed.
<p>As noted by Gerhart and Rynes (2003): &lsquo;The vast majority of research on this theory has been
performed in school rather than work settings, often with elementary school-aged children.&rsquo;
But that did not stop other commentators assuming that the results were equally significant
for working adults. It is interesting to note that research in industry conducted by Ryan,
Mimms and Koestner (1983), while it found that financial incentives did decrease intrinsic
motivation in high-control organizational cultures, also established that in organizations with
the opposite high-involvement culture, both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation was increased
by monetary incentives. Context is all-important.
<p>Moreover, the outcomes of the Deci et al study were challenged by another meta-analysis of
145 studies conducted by Cameron et al (2001). This concluded that tangible rewards can be
used to produce both negative and positive effects on measures of intrinsic motivation. As
they commented:
<p>Our results suggest that in general, rewards are not harmful to motivation to perform
a task. Rewards given for low-interest tasks enhance free-choice intrinsic motivation.
On high-interest tasks, verbal rewards produce positive effects on free-choice motiva-
tion and self-reported task interest. Negative effects are found on high-interest tasks
when the rewards are tangible, expected (offered beforehand), and loosely tied to level
of performance. When rewards are linked to level of performance, measures of intrinsic
motivation increase or do not differ from a non-rewarded control group.</p>

<p>They quoted a number of studies including Dickinson and Taylor (1989), Mawhinney et al
(1989) and Skaggs et al (1992), which showed that rewards do not inevitably have pervasive
negative effects on intrinsic motivation.
<p>Conclusions on the theory
<p>As Gerhart and Rynes (2003) commented:
<p>Although the ideas developed by Maslow, Herzberg and Deci have had considerable
appeal to many people, the prevailing view in the academic literature is that the specific
predictions of these theories is not supported by empirical evidence. On the other hand
it would be a mistake to underestimate the influence that these theories have had on
research and practice. Pfeffer, Kohn and others continue to base their argument regard-
ing the ineffectiveness of money as a motivator on such theories.
<p>Steers (2001) contended that: &lsquo;Motivation theories that were discredited long ago still perme-
ate current textbooks.&rsquo; He was referring mainly to Maslow and Herzberg.
<p>The role of money
<p>Commentators who question the usefulness of financial rewards often contend that money is
much less important than many people think. As Pfeffer (1998) wrote: &lsquo;People do work for
money &ndash; but they work even more for meaning in their lives. In fact, they work to have fun.
Companies that ignore this fact are essentially bribing their employees and will pay the price
in a lack of loyalty and commitment.&rsquo; Furnham (2006) stated that: &lsquo;Money is not everything.
Many would be happy with more time off, or more job security, than more money. People are
prepared to trade-off things for money once they have enough or grow weary of the game.&rsquo;
<p>Views about the importance of pay
<p>Many surveys have been carried out to assess the relative importance of pay in relation to other
factors affecting motivation. Typically, pay is somewhere down the list after job interest,
achievement, recognition and development opportunities. As Kohn (1998) stated: &lsquo;Numerous
studies have shown that when people are asked what is most important to them about work,
money ranks well behind such factors as interesting work or good people to work with.&rsquo; For
example, 1,355 managers and other professionals surveyed by Ritchie and Martin (1999)
placed money and tangible rewards ninth in a list of 12 &lsquo;motivational drivers&rsquo;.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>144 Performance and Reward
<p>In an earlier study, Jurgensen (1978) assessed the relative importance of job characteristics
(including pay) to 50,000 job applicants over a 30-year period. Pay was the fifth most impor-
tant characteristic to men and the seventh most important to women. However, when asked
to rate the importance of the same 10 attributes to &lsquo;someone just like yourself &ndash; same age, edu-
cation, gender and so on&rsquo;, pay jumped to being the most important factor among both men
and women. In other words, people seemed to believe that pay was the main motivator to eve-
ryone except themselves.
<p>As Slovic and Lichtenstein (1971) commented, people tend to give lower ratings to factors that
are regarded as socially less acceptable than others. They overrate the socially desirable impor-
tance of job challenge and opportunities for learning, and underrate the importance of &lsquo;low-level
motivators such as pay&rsquo;. Such ranking exercises, as Lawler (1971) pointed out, produce results
that vary according to the methodology used and can therefore be misleading. They do not prove
that pay is perceived to be relatively unimportant. Studies such as those conducted by McDou-
gall (1973) and Blackburn and Mann (1979) have indicated that the opposite is the case.
<p>Money and motivation
<p>It is reasonable to assume that people need money and therefore want money but the question
is: How well does it perform as a motivator? It has been suggested by Wallace and Szilagyi
(1982) that money can serve the following reward functions:
<p>It can act as a goal that people generally strive for, although to different degrees. &bull;
<p>It can act as an instrument that provides valued outcomes. &bull;
<p>It can be a symbol that indicates the recipient&rsquo;s value to the organization. &bull;
<p>It can act as a general reinforcer because it is associated with valued rewards and there- &bull;
fore takes on reward value itself.
<p>Money can motivate because it is linked directly or indirectly with the satisfaction of many
needs. It satisfies the basic need for survival and security, if income is regular. It can also satisfy
the need for self-esteem (it is a visible mark of appreciation) and status &ndash; money can set you in
a grade apart from your fellows and can buy you things they cannot afford. Money satisfies the
less desirable but nevertheless prevalent drives of acquisitiveness and cupidity. So money may
in itself have no intrinsic meaning, but it acquires motivating power because it comes to sym-
bolize so many intangible goals. It acts as a symbol in different ways for different people, and
for the same person at different times. Pay is often a dominant factor in the choice of employer
and is an important consideration when people are deciding whether or not to stay with an
organization. Money can indeed motivate but it is not the only motivator. As Gerhart and
Rynes (2003) comment: &lsquo;Although we see little evidence to support the notion that money is
of secondary importance as a motivator, there is nevertheless ample evidence that money is
not the only reward that motivates.&rsquo;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 145
<p>However, according to Herzberg (1968) money does not result in lasting satisfaction. People
may feel good when they get an increase as, apart from the extra money, it is a way of making
people feel they are valued. But the feeling of euphoria can die away and it must be re-empha-
sized that different people have different needs. Some will be much more motivated by money
than others. What cannot be assumed is that money motivates everyone in the same way and
to the same extent.
<p>To believe that financial incentives will always motivate people to perform better is as simplis-
tic as to assume, like Kohn, that they never motivate people to perform better. Some people
will be more motivated by money that others and, if handled properly, an incentive scheme in
the right context can encourage them to perform more effectively as long as they can link their
effort to the reward and the reward is worth having. But others may be less interested in
money and will respond more to intrinsic or non-financial rewards. It can be argued in accord-
ance with total rewards philosophy that most people are likely to react positively to a judicious
mix of both financial and non-financial rewards.
<p>What is clear is that simplistic assumptions about the power of money to motivate can lead
organizations into developing simplistic performance-related pay schemes or other forms of
incentives. And we can be sure that a multiplicity of interdependent factors are involved in
motivating people. Money is only one of those factors that may work for some people in some
circumstances, but may not work for other people in other circumstances.
<p>It should also be remembered that while an increase in pay arising from a contingent pay
scheme may motivate people who get it, for a limited period perhaps, it may well demotivate
those who don&rsquo;t get it or feel that they are not getting enough compared with other people.
The number of people demotivated in this way could be larger than the number who have
been motivated. Paradoxically, therefore, contingent pay schemes are in danger of increasing
the amount of demotivation existing in the organization rather than enhancing motivation.
<p>Factors affecting satisfaction with pay
<p>As Lawler (1990) points out, people&rsquo;s feelings about the adequacy of their pay are based upon
comparisons they make between their own and others&rsquo;. External market comparisons are the
most critical because they are the ones that strongly influence whether individuals want to stay
with the organization. Many people, however, are unlikely to leave for pay reasons alone unless
the increase they expect from a move is substantial, say 10 per cent.
<p>Lawler also comments: &lsquo;Sometimes it seems that individuals are never satisfied with the
pay.&rsquo; One of the reasons suggested by Lawler for low pay satisfaction seems to be that indi-
viduals seek out unfavourable comparisons. First they look externally: if comparisons there
are favourable, they focus on internal comparisons. Only if these are favourable as well are
they likely to be satisfied. He states that: &lsquo;A finding that employees are dissatisfied with pay
is, in effect, a non-finding. It is to be expected. The key thing that the organization needs to </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>146 Performance and Reward
<p>focus on is whether its employees are more dissatisfied with their pay than are employees in
other organizations.&rsquo;
<p>Reactions to reward policies and practices will depend largely on the values and needs of indi-
viduals and on their employment conditions. It is therefore dangerous to generalize about the
causes of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. However, it seems reasonable to believe that, as men-
tioned above, feelings about external and internal equity (the &lsquo;felt fair&rsquo; principle as defined by
Jaques, 1961) will strongly influence most people. Research by Porter and Lawler (1968) has
also shown that higher-paid employees are likely to be more satisfied with their rewards but
the satisfaction resulting from a large pay increase may be short-lived. People tend to want
more of the same. In this respect, at least, the views of Maslow and Herzberg have been sup-
ported by research.
<p>Other factors which may affect satisfaction or dissatisfaction with pay include the degree to
which:
<p>individuals feel their rate of pay or increase has been determined fairly (the principle of &bull;
procedural justice);
<p>rewards are commensurate with the perceptions of individuals about their ability, con- &bull;
tribution and value to the organization founded on information or beliefs about what
other people, inside and outside the organization, are paid (the principle of distributive
justice);
<p>individuals are satisfied with other aspects of their employment &ndash; for example, the &bull;
quality of working life, work&ndash;life balance, their status, promotion prospects, opportu-
nity to use and develop skills, and relations with their managers and colleagues.
<p>Job satisfaction and performance
<p>Pay may increase job satisfaction but does job satisfaction improve performance? It is a com-
monly held and a seemingly not unreasonable belief that it does. But research has not established
any strongly positive connection between satisfaction and performance. A review of the exten-
sive literature on this subject by Brayfield and Crockett (1955) concluded that there was little
evidence of any simple or appreciable relationship between employee satisfaction and perform-
ance. An updated review of their analysis by Vroom (1964) covered 20 studies, in each of which
one or more measures of job satisfaction or employee attitudes was correlated with one or more
criteria of performance. The median correlation of all these studies was 0.14, which is not high
enough to suggest a marked relationship between satisfaction and performance
<p>It can be argued that it is not job satisfaction that produces high performance but high per-
formance that produces job satisfaction, and that a satisfied worker is not necessarily a pro-
ductive worker and a high producer is not necessarily a satisfied worker. People are motivated
to achieve certain goals and will be satisfied if they achieve these goals through improved per-</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 147
<p>formance. They may be even more satisfied if they are then rewarded by extrinsic recognition
or an intrinsic sense of achievement. It can also be argued that some people may be compla-
cently satisfied with their job and will not be inspired to work harder or better. They may find
other ways to satisfy their needs.
<p>Research on the effectiveness of financial rewards
<p>Much research has been conducted on the effectiveness of financial rewards in terms of their
impact on people and performance. A number of UK projects in the early 1990s produced
negative results on the impact of performance-related pay (PRP) on people, and these have
influenced views about PRP ever since. But four more recent studies in the UK and many
studies in the United States over the years have established a positive relationship between
incentive pay and performance. A selection of these negative and positive projects are summa-
rized below.
<p>Research projects producing mainly negative results
Kessler and Purcell (1992)
<p>Research into individual performance-related pay (PRP) was conducted over a three-year
period in nine private and public sector organizations of varying sizes and operating in differ-
ent product and labour markets. Material was also gained from interviews with over 60 senior
and management figures.
<p>The main findings and conclusions were that:
<p>PRP was seen as a means of targeting pay to those who most deserve it and thus pro- &bull;
vides better value for money than inflexible, less discriminatory increases related to
cost of living or service.
<p>Managements often experienced difficulties in operating the scheme because of the &bull;
lack of formal supporting systems, absence of prior management training and the
highly subjective nature of assessments.
<p>The potential for distorting the system is perhaps at its greatest at the assessment &bull;
stage.
<p>PRP depends on &lsquo;sending messages&rsquo; to individual members of staff but this entails the &bull;
risk of sending the wrong messages.
<p>At the crudest of levels, PRP schemes are informed by the view that employees will be
motivated if they perceive a direct relationship between effort and reward. Such a view is
simplistic for a number of reasons. First, as a means of explaining employee behaviour it
clearly has limited value, with a whole body of research stressing the importance of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>148 Performance and Reward
<p>employee expectations and need in understanding motivation. Second, it is highly ques-
tionable whether employee expectations of the performance&ndash;reward link underlying this
motivational approach can remain undistorted by ongoing social, political and economic
workplace pressures influencing the operation of this pay system. Third, and perhaps
most significant, it misses the point because many senior managers are sceptical of such a
link themselves and do not necessarily claim any major impact in this particular respect.
<p>The amount of money available may be too small to make any impact. &bull;
<p>The sophisticated procedures and systems needed and their application by manag- &bull;
ers present a range of difficulties to the achievement of recruitment, retention and
motivation.
<p>&lsquo;There are major difficulties in finding measures of PRP effectiveness. The bottom line &bull;
measure of effectiveness for any payment system is arguably an improvement in overall
organizational performance, assumed to flow from improved employee performance. It
is, however, clear that the complex range of factors interacting to determine organiza-
tional performance make it difficult to isolate the impact of a payment system alone.&rsquo;
<p>Thompson (1992a)
<p>Marc Thompson, then with the IMS (now the Institute for Employment Studies), investigated
the employer&rsquo;s experience of individual performance-related pay (IPRP) in 20 organizations
in the public and private sectors. He found that:
<p>Employers did not know if their scheme was effective in raising productivity for the &bull;
simple reason that they did not monitor schemes on this basis.
<p>Many companies did not think through the introduction of IPRP in a coherent manner. &bull;
<p>There was some indication that line managers were neither totally aware nor convinced &bull;
of the appropriateness of IPRP &ndash; it was this issue that led to some of the most difficult
problems in practice.
<p>There are two main problems with the operation of IPRP schemes: 1) the values of &bull;
employers may conflict with the values of employees, and 2) tensions may arise from
employers&rsquo; beliefs about employee motivation and behaviour.
<p>One employer commented: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an act of faith really&hellip; we think things would be worse &bull;
if we weren&rsquo;t using it.&rsquo;
<p>One of the few employers who had conducted a survey on perceptions of IPRP found &bull;
that when it was first introduced, less than 20 per cent felt it motivated; changes in the
scheme&rsquo;s administration had seen this rise to over 60 per cent (just over 80 per cent felt
that they were rated fairly).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 149
<p>One of the most consistent problems encountered in studying the effects of perform- &bull;
ance pay is that of causality &ndash; attributing increases or decreases in productivity to the
payment system rather than to other factors such as technology, changes in working
practices or changes in the product market.
<p>The theoretical framework most used to support IPRP is expectancy theory, but this is &bull;
based exclusively on the motivating effects of extrinsic rewards and ignores intrinsic
rewards &ndash; it implies that &lsquo;money is the central incentive in terms of human motivation.&rsquo;
<p>There is no best approach to the introduction of IPRP and employers are advised to &bull;
tread carefully when considering its implementation.
<p>Thompson (1992b)
<p>A survey was conducted of nearly 1,000 employees in three organizations to obtain their views
about performance-related pay. The findings were as follows:
<p>There was little evidence that PRP had served to motivate employees. &bull;
<p>&lsquo;It is possible that performance pay may be more successful in demotivating the very &bull;
employees it needs to stimulate most &ndash; the average performers &ndash; and may , in practice,
contribute to a downward spiral of motivation among such employees.&rsquo;
<p>In only one of the three cases was PRP associated with the retention of high performers. &bull;
<p>Poor performers were as likely to stay as high performers. &bull;
<p>The relationship between the subordinate and the line manager was the most impor- &bull;
tant in influencing employee perceptions about PRP.
<p>Achieving distributive and procedural justice was important. &bull;
<p>&lsquo;Informing staff, training them in appraisal and involving them in the design of the &bull;
scheme from the outset is key to gaining employee trust in and winning commitment
to PRP.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;Unfortunately none of the three organizations undertook all three interventions and &bull;
very few had either informed or trained their staff.&rsquo;
<p>The lack of these interventions &lsquo;may explain the widespread distrust of the fairness and &bull;
equity of the schemes&rsquo;.
<p>&lsquo;Across the three case study organizations there was a surprising consensus in the per- &bull;
ceived poor management of the appraisal and merit pay process by line managers.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;Given that performance management is a policy intervention to be owned by the line &bull;
there is a need to equip managers to take on this responsibility.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;There is evidence that participative processes may be important in ensuring the greater &bull;
success of PRP among employees.&rsquo;</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>150 Performance and Reward
<p>Marsden and Richardson (1994)
<p>The results of a survey of 2,000 Inland Revenue staff indicated that the system had only a small
positive motivational effect on staff. The researchers concluded that: &lsquo;If motivation was not
improved at all significantly, or had deteriorated, it is hard to see why performance should
have been changed for the better. Why should performance pay have had so little general effect
on motivation when 57 per cent of the staff reported being in favour of the principle of PRP?
First, and most importantly, it was widely judged to be unfair in its operation.&rsquo;
<p>Research projects producing mainly positive results
<p>Evidence is available from a number of academic studies that indicate that performance pay
improves performance:
<p>Abowd (1990) showed that bonus payments based on economic or market measures &bull;
could contribute to a strong economic return.
<p>Booth and Frank (1999) found through their analysis of UK data provided by the &bull;
British Household Panel Survey that jobs with performance-related pay attracted
workers of higher ability and induced workers to provide greater effort.
<p>Gupta and Shaw (1998) conducted a meta-analysis of 39 rigorously designed studies &bull;
examining the effects of financial incentives on performance. A strong positive effect
was found on performance quantity. Only six studies examined performance quality
separately and a consistent relationship between incentives and quality was not
found.
<p>Guzzo &bull; et al (1985) found through a meta-analysis that, when applied in the right way
and in the right situations, incentives can have strongly positive effects on productiv-
ity.
<p>Heneman (1992) reviewed five studies that established a positive link between a merit- &bull;
pay system and performance.
<p>Jenkins &bull; et al (1998) said of their study that it &lsquo;underscores the generalizable positive
relationship between financial incentives and performance&rsquo;.
<p>Lazear (1999) found that the productivity of operatives in a factory increased by 44 per &bull;
cent following the introduction of a piece-rate incentive plan.
<p>Locke &bull; et al (1980) reviewed 44 studies on the adoption of incentive systems that showed
in almost all cases a substantial improvement in performance.
<p>Marsden (2004) conducted a series of attitude surveys across a range of UK public serv- &bull;
ices on employee and line manager judgements on the effects of performance pay. Per-
formance pay was the instrument of a major renegotiation of performance norms, and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 151
<p>this rather than motivation was the principal dynamic. Goal-setting and appraisal by
line managers played a key role in this process.
<p>Prendergast (1999) reviewed the effect of incentives in both private and public sectors, &bull;
leading to the conclusion that workers do respond to them.
<p>Prentice &bull; et al (2007) found that research indicated strong evidence that UK civil serv-
ants do respond to financial incentives.
<p>Stajkovic and Luthans (2001) showed that routine pay for performance increased per- &bull;
formance over its baseline level by 11 per cent, while performance pay applied through
the systematic procedures of the organizational behaviour model increased perform-
ance by 31.7 per cent.
<p>Sturman &bull; et al (2003) used utility analysis techniques to assess the costs and benefits of
a contingent pay strategy. The conclusion was that the four-year benefit of linking pay
to performance was substantial.
<p>Thompson (1998) in a study of 400 companies in the British aerospace industry estab- &bull;
lished that the high-value-added and low-value-added companies were clearly differ-
entiated in terms of their pay practices, with virtually double the number of
high-value-added companies applying individual performance-related pay schemes to
more than two-thirds of their staff.
<p>West &bull; et al (2005) conducted research in 15 customer service organizations into methods
of rewarding customer service, and found that in the five organizations superior to
others in terms of customer service, 60 per cent had performance pay while in the other
10 only 29 per cent had performance pay.
<p>Implications
<p>A recurring theme in the negative UK studies was that the problems arose because of the ways
in which schemes were introduced and operated within particular contexts rather than because
of the principles upon which they were based. An example was the incorrect assumption that
schemes that worked well in the private sector would work equally well in the public sector.
<p>This was confirmed in research conducted for the Department of Employment by Bowey and
Thorpe (1982). This showed that performance pay design bore no correlation with successful
outcomes, which were more dependent on the effectiveness of communication and support
systems. The quality and communication of scheme objectives linked to business strategy and
goals was found to be a key differentiator between successful and unsuccessful performance.
It was noted that the essential requirement is to tailor pay schemes to suit the particular organ-
ization and environment.</p>

<br>
<p>152 Performance and Reward
<p>Arguments for and against financial rewards
<p>The concept of financial rewards in the shape of contingent pay has aroused strong feelings
amongst those who support and those who oppose them. The arguments for and against are
set out below.
<p>Arguments for
<p>The most powerful argument advanced for financial rewards is that those who contribute
more should be paid more. It is right and proper to recognize achievement with a financial and
therefore tangible reward. This is in accordance with the principle of distributive justice,
which, while it states that rewards should be provided equitably, does not require them to be
equal except when the value of contribution is equal.
<p>Arguments against
<p>The main arguments against financial rewards are that:
<p>The extent to which contingent pay schemes motivate is questionable &ndash; the amounts &bull;
available for distribution are usually so small that they cannot act as an incentive.
<p>The requirements for success are exacting and difficult to achieve. &bull;
<p>Money by itself it will not result in sustained motivation; intrinsic motivation provided &bull;
by the work itself goes deeper and lasts longer.
<p>People react in widely different ways to any form of motivation &ndash; it cannot be assumed &bull;
that money will motivate all people equally, yet that is the premise on which contingent
pay schemes are based.
<p>Financial rewards may possibly motivate those who receive them but they can demoti- &bull;
vate those that don&rsquo;t, and the numbers who are demotivated could be much higher
than those who are motivated.
<p>Contingent pay schemes can create more dissatisfaction than satisfaction if they are &bull;
perceived to be unfair, inadequate or badly managed.
<p>Employees can be suspicious of schemes because they fear that performance bars will &bull;
be continuously raised; a scheme may therefore only operate successfully for a limited
period.
<p>Schemes depend on the existence of accurate and reliable methods of measuring per- &bull;
formance, contribution, competence or skill, which might not exist.
<p>Individuals are encouraged to emphasize only those aspects of performance that are &bull;
rewarded.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Financial Rewards 153
<p>Contingent pay decisions depend on the judgement of managers, which in the absence &bull;
of reliable criteria can be partial, prejudiced, inconsistent or ill-informed.
<p>The concept of contingent pay is based on the assumption that performance is com- &bull;
pletely under the control of individuals when in fact it is affected by the system in
which they work.
<p>Contingent pay, especially performance-related pay, can militate against quality and &bull;
teamwork.
<p>Another powerful argument against contingent pay is that it has proved difficult to manage.
Organizations, including the Civil Service, rushed into performance-related pay in the 1980s
without really understanding how to make it work. Inevitably problems of implementation
arose. Studies such as those mentioned earlier have all revealed these difficulties. Failures may
arise because insufficient attention has been given to fitting schemes to the context and culture
of the organization; instead they are often rooted in implementation and operating processes,
especially those concerned with performance management, the need for effective communica-
tion and involvement, and line management capability.
<p>The last factor is crucial. As Thompson (1992a, 1992b) explained, the success of contingent
pay rests largely in the hands of line managers. They have to believe in it as something that
will help them as well as the organization. They must also be good at practising the crucial
skills of agreeing targets, measuring performance fairly and consistently, and providing
feedback to their staff on the outcome of performance management and its impact on pay.
Line managers can make or break contingent pay schemes. Vicky Wright (1991) summed it
up: &lsquo;Even the most ardent supporters of performance-related pay recognize that it is diffi-
cult to manage well,&rsquo; and Oliver (1996) made the point that &lsquo;performance pay is beautiful in
theory but difficult in practice.&rsquo;
<p>There is also the problem of moral hazard inherent in financial incentives. The concept of
moral hazard originated in insurance, where it describes the phenomenon of people who
because they are insulated from risk by being insured proceed to take unnecessary risks. The
term was extended to incentives by Prendergast (1999), who pointed out that: &lsquo;Contracts
offering incentives can give rise to dysfunctional behaviour whereby agents emphasize only
those objects of performance that are rewarded&hellip; Compensation on any sub-set of tasks will
result in reallocation of activities towards those that are directly compensated and away from
the uncompensated activities.&rsquo; A &lsquo;moral hazard&rsquo; exists when incentive schemes encourage
undesirable behaviour in which people strive to obtain higher rewards by manipulating results,
hiding or even falsifying poor figures, focusing on easy short-term gains rather than the
tougher long-term demands or going for one result and neglecting another important outcome,
as when they pursue output increases at the expense of quality. These problems can be difficult
to spot, especially if everyone&rsquo;s attention is focused on headline figures and not what lies
beneath them. As Lawler (1971) warned: &lsquo;It is quite difficult to establish criteria that are both
measurable quantitatively and inclusive of all the important job behaviours.&rsquo;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>154 Performance and Reward
<p>Criteria for effectiveness
<p>The effectiveness of financial rewards in the shape of contingent pay depends on the following
factors:
<p>There must be accurate, consistent and fair assessment of performance or contribution. &bull;
<p>Pay differences can be related to performance or contribution differences and can be &bull;
seen to be related.
<p>The principles of procedural and distributive justice are upheld. &bull;
<p>There is a climate of trust in the organization &ndash; as Thompson (1992b) commented: &bull;
&lsquo;Where there is trust, involvement and a commitment to fairness, the (PRP) schemes
work.&rsquo;
<p>Performance management systems function well. &bull;
<p>Line managers have the necessary skills and commitment. &bull;
<p>Stakeholders, including line managers, employees and employee representatives, have &bull;
been involved in the design of the scheme.
<p>The scheme is appropriate to the context and culture of the organization. &bull;
<p>The scheme is not unduly complex. &bull;
<p>The purpose, methodology and effect of the scheme have been communicated and &bull;
understood.
<p>There is a clear line of sight between effort and reward. &bull;
<p>Rewards are attainable and worth attaining. &bull;
<p>Summaries of the factors that have been found in various research projects to relate to the
success of financial rewards in the shape of contingent pay plans are shown in Table 8.1.
<p>Gupta and Shaw (1998) summed up the dos and don&rsquo;ts of financial incentives admirably, as
set out in Table 8.2.</p>

<p>156 Performance and Reward
<p>Conclusions
<p>A comprehensive study by Brown and Armstrong (1999) into the effectiveness of contingent
pay as revealed by a number of research projects produced two overall conclusions: 1) contin-
gent pay cannot be endorsed or rejected universally as a principle, and 2) no type of contingent
pay is universally successful or unsuccessful. They concluded their analysis of the research
findings by stating that &lsquo;the research does show that the effectiveness of pay-for-performance
schemes is highly context and situation-specific; and it has highlighted the practical problems
which many companies have experienced with these schemes.&rsquo;
<p>Six tips for using financial rewards
Provide for the accurate, consistent and fair assessment of performance or &bull;
contribution.
<p>Fit the scheme to the context and culture of the organization. &bull;
<p>Keep it simple. &bull;
<p>Involve stakeholders, including line managers, employees and employee &bull;
representatives, in the design of the scheme.
<p>Communicate the purpose, methodology and effect of the scheme. &bull;
<p>Ensure that there is a clear line of sight between effort and reward and that the &bull;
rewards provided by the scheme are attainable and worth attaining.

<p>Non-financial Rewards 161
<p>Introduction
<p>Non-financial rewards are those that focus on the needs people have to varying degrees for
recognition, achievement, responsibility, autonomy, influence and personal growth. They
incorporate the notion of relational rewards, which are the intangible rewards concerned with
the work environment (quality of working life, the work itself, work&ndash;life balance), recogni-
tion, performance management, and learning and development.
<p>Non-financial rewards can be extrinsic, such as praise or recognition, or intrinsic, arising from
the work itself associated with job challenge and interest and feelings that the work is worth-
while.
<p>This chapter starts with an exploration of the significance of non-financial rewards. It then
deals with each of the major aspects of non-financial rewards and ends with a discussion on
how they can be developed as an important part of a total rewards approach.
<p>The significance of non-financial rewards
<p>Latham and Locke (1979) noted that: &lsquo;Money is obviously the primary incentive&rsquo; but they
went on to say that &lsquo;money alone is not enough to motivate high performance.&rsquo; Money may
be an important factor in attracting and retaining people (the sorting effect). It can produce
satisfaction, but this may be short-lived. And if the principles of distributive and procedural
justice are not followed, it can cause lasting dissatisfaction.
<p>It can be said that money will motivate some of the people all of the time and, perhaps, all of
the people some of the time. But it cannot be relied on to motivate all of the people all of the
time. To rely on it as the sole motivator is misguided. Money has to be reinforced by non-
financial rewards, especially those that provide intrinsic motivation. When motivation is
achieved by such means it can have a more powerful and longer-lasting effect on people, and
financial and non-financial rewards can be mutually reinforcing.
<p>Reward systems should therefore be designed and managed in such a way as to provide the
best mix of all kinds of motivators according to the needs of the organization and its
members.
<p>Types of non-financial rewards
Non-financial rewards can be classified as follows:
<p>individual extrinsic rewards: non-financial recognition, praise, feedback; &bull;
<p>individual intrinsic rewards: fulfilling work, opportunity to grow; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>162 Performance and Reward
<p>collective extrinsic rewards: work&ndash;life balance policies, employee well-being services, &bull;
concierge services, voluntary benefits, learning and development and talent manage-
ment programmes;
<p>collective intrinsic rewards: work environment enhancement, work system design. &bull;
<p>Individual extrinsic rewards
Non-financial recognition
<p>Recognition is one of the most powerful methods of rewarding people. They need to know not
only how well they have achieved their objectives or carried out their work but also that their
achievements are appreciated. Recognition needs are linked to the esteem needs in Maslow&rsquo;s
(1954) hierarchy of needs. They are defined by Maslow as the need to have a stable, firmly
based, high evaluation of oneself (self-esteem) and to have the respect of others (prestige).
These needs are classified into two subsidiary sets: first, &lsquo;the desire for achievement, for ade-
quacy, for confidence in the face of the world, and for independence and freedom&rsquo;, and second,
&lsquo;the desire for reputation or status defined as respect or esteem from other people, and mani-
fested by recognition, attention, importance or appreciation&rsquo;.
<p>Belief in the motivational value of recognition is supported by Herzberg&rsquo;s (1957, 1968)
research, which identified recognition as an important &lsquo;satisfier&rsquo;. Although the methodology
he used has been heavily criticized, the proposition that recognizing people for what they
achieve makes them feel good and therefore helps to enlist their engagement rings true.
<p>Recognition is a form of feedback that lets people know that they have done well and therefore
provides positive reinforcement. Research by Brand et al (1982) found that a feedback pro-
gramme in a US government agency that involved public recognition brought about an
increase in productivity of 26 to 149 per cent in different sections. A meta-analysis by DeNisi
and Kluger (2000) of 131 empirical studies that had tested how well feedback interventions
worked indicated a modest but positive effect of feedback on performance overall.
<p>Recognition can be provided by positive and immediate feedback from managers and col-
leagues that acknowledges individual contributions, and by managers who listen to and act
upon the suggestions of their team members. Other actions that provide recognition include
allocation to a high-profile project and enrichment of the job to provide scope for more inter-
esting and rewarding work.
<p>There are other forms of recognition such as public &lsquo;applause&rsquo;, status symbols of one kind or
another, sabbaticals, treats, trips abroad and long-service awards, all of which can function as
rewards. But they must be used with care. One person&rsquo;s recognition implies an element of
non-recognition to others and the consequences of having winners and losers need to be care-
fully managed. Recognition schemes are examined more thoroughly in Chapter 14.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Non-financial Rewards 163
<p>Praise
<p>Praise is, of course, a form of recognition. It can be given privately during the course of work
or in a performance review meeting. Public praise can be even more rewarding. But the praise
must be genuine and saved for real achievements. It should not be fulsome.
<p>Feedback
<p>Feedback is another form of recognition. If done properly it can increase self-belief and provide
the basis for self-directed learning.
<p>Individual intrinsic rewards
Fulfilling work
<p>Work can be fulfilling and therefore motivating when individuals feel that what they do is
worthwhile and adds value. This implies that they should ideally work on a complete process
or product, or a significant part of it that can be seen as a whole. Work is also fulfilling when
it requires people to use abilities they value to perform it effectively and scope is provided for
achievement, responsibility, autonomy and influence.
<p>Use of abilities
<p>Fulfilling work enables people to use and develop their abilities. This is particularly the case
when people are stretched, but not too hard, to achieve more than they expected they could
achieve.
<p>Achievement
<p>The need to achieve applies in varying degrees to all people in all jobs, although the level at
which it operates will depend on the orientation of the individual and the scope provided by
the work to fulfil a need for achievement. People feel rewarded and motivated if they have the
scope to achieve as well as being recognized for the achievement.
<p>Responsibility
<p>Individuals can be motivated by being given more responsibility for their work. People are in
positions of responsibility when they are held to account for what they do. They are in charge
of their work and the resources required to do it. Being given more responsibility can satisfy
needs for achievement and increase self-esteem. It is also a form of recognition.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>164 Performance and Reward
<p>Autonomy
<p>Autonomy exists when an individual has freedom to make decisions and act independently
without reference to higher authority. It enhances self-belief, gives people more opportunity
to achieve and provides an opportunity to develop skills.
<p>Influence
<p>Jobs are more fulfilling if people can influence what they do or exert wider influence on policy
and operational decisions.
<p>Opportunity to grow
<p>Alderfer (1972) emphasized the importance of providing people with opportunities for per-
sonal growth as a means of rewarding and therefore motivating them. He believed that satis-
faction of growth needs takes place when individuals have the opportunity to be what they are
most fully and to become what they can. Most learning and development opportunities take
place in the course of everyday work, and the organization can encourage this through coach-
ing, mentoring and support in the implementation of personal development plans created as
part of the performance management process.
<p>Collective extrinsic rewards
<p>Collective extrinsic rewards are provided by the organization in the shape of policies,
procedures, services and programmes such as the following:
<p>Work&ndash;life balance policies reward people by recognizing their needs outside work by, &bull;
for example, adopting family-friendly policies, including the provision of more flexible
working arrangements.
<p>Employee well-being services can be provided for individuals to help them deal with &bull;
their problems. This may involve counselling or personal casework where the aim is as
far as possible to get individuals to help themselves.
<p>Concierge services provide employees with help by undertaking mundane personal &bull;
tasks such as getting their car serviced, home repairs or waiting at home for deliveries.
<p>Voluntary benefit schemes provide opportunities for employees to buy goods or serv- &bull;
ices at discounted prices. The employer negotiates deals with the suppliers.
<p>Learning and development programmes give employees the chance to develop their &bull;
skills and careers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Non-financial Rewards 165
<p>Collective intrinsic rewards
<p>Collective intrinsic rewards are provided mainly through the work environment. They relate
to the quality of working life provided and the organization&rsquo;s core values.
<p>Quality of working life
<p>The quality of working life refers to the feelings of satisfaction and well-being arising from the
work itself and the way people are treated. On the basis of their longitudinal research in 12
companies Purcell et al (2003) concluded that:
<p>What seems to be happening is that successful firms are able to meet peoples&rsquo; needs both
for a good job and to work &lsquo;in a great place&rsquo;. They create good work and a conducive
working environment. In this way they become an &lsquo;employer of choice&rsquo;. People will
want to work there because their individual needs are met &ndash; for a good job with pros-
pects linked to training, appraisal and working with a good boss who listens and gives
some autonomy but helps with coaching and guidance.
<p>Specifically, the quality of working life depends on having a system of work that enables jobs
to be designed that provide for intrinsic motivation, on good working conditions and on the
leadership qualities of line managers and team leaders.
<p>Core values
<p>The significance of the core values of an organization as a basis for creating a rewarding work
environment was identified by the research conducted by John Purcell and his colleagues
referred to above. The most successful companies had what the researchers called &lsquo;the big
idea&rsquo;. They had a clear vision and a set of integrated values that were embedded, enduring, col-
lective, measured and managed. They were concerned with sustaining performance and flex-
ibility. Clear connections existed between positive attitudes towards HR policies and practices,
levels of satisfaction, motivation and commitment, and operational performance.</p>

<p>166 Performance and Reward
<p>Using non-financial rewards: six tips
Develop the use of non-financial rewards as part of a total rewards policy. &bull;
<p>Introduce employment practices designed to ensure the fair and ethical &bull;
treatment of employees.
<p>Involve employees as stakeholders in drawing up a set of core values associated &bull;
with the employment relationship and in planning and implementing the steps
required to ensure that everyone concerned &lsquo;lives the values&rsquo;.
<p>Review the features of the work environment and introduce changes that will &bull;
improve the quality of working life and deal with any issues that may affect it.
<p>Examine ways in which the design of the work system and jobs can be improved &bull;
to make them more rewarding. Ensure that all those involved in work or job
design (which means line managers) know what they can do and why and how
they should do it.
<p>Develop and implement specific policies and practices in such areas as &bull;
recognition, work&ndash;life balance, well-being programmes, concierge services,
voluntary benefits, performance management, learning and development and
talent management.

<p>Introduction
<p>Contingent pay is concerned with answering two fundamental reward management questions:
1) What do we value? and 2) What are we prepared to pay for? Contingent pay schemes are
based on measurements or assessments. These may be expressed as ratings that are converted

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>168 Performance and Reward
<p>by means of a formula to a payment. Alternatively, there may be no formal ratings and pay
decisions may be based on broad assessments rather than a formula.
<p>This chapter deals only with schemes that provide payments to individuals in addition to their
base rate, related to their performance, contribution, competency, or skill. Bonus schemes,
which pay non-consolidated lump sums based on performance (variable pay), are covered in
Chapter 11. Pay schemes rewarding for team or organizational performance are described in
Chapters 12 and 13 respectively. In addition, rewards can be provided by recognition schemes
as discussed in Chapter 14.
<p>The e-reward 2009 survey of contingent pay established that contingent pay schemes were
used by the 107 respondents in the proportions shown in Table 10.1.

<p>Objectives of contingent pay
<p>The main objectives for using contingent pay given by respondents to the e-reward 2009
survey are set out in Table 10.2.
<p>Criteria for success
<p>The following are the five criteria for effective contingent pay:
<p>Individuals have a clear line of sight between what they do and what they will get for &bull;
doing it. A line of sight model adapted from Lawler (1988) is shown in Figure 10.1. The
concept expresses the essence of expectancy theory: that motivation only takes place
when people expect that their effort and contribution will be rewarded. The reward
should be clearly and closely linked to accomplishment or effort &ndash; people know what
they will get if they achieve defined and agreed targets or standards, and can track their
performance against them.</p>

<p>Rewards are worth having. &bull;
<p>Fair and consistent means are available for measuring or assessing performance, &bull;
competence, contribution or skill.
<p>People are able to influence their performance by changing their behaviour and &bull;
developing their competencies and skills.
<p>The reward follows as closely as possible the accomplishment that generated it. &bull;
<p>These are demanding requirements and few schemes meet them in full. That is why contin-
gent pay arrangements can often promise more than they deliver.
<p>The various forms of contingent pay are described in the following sections of this chapter.
<p>Performance-related pay
<p>Performance-related pay (PRP) is the most popular contingent pay scheme. It is also contro-
versial, largely because, especially in its early days, it was introduced and managed badly and
the high expectations of its impact on performance and its ability to change cultures were not </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>170 Performance and Reward
<p>fulfilled. The assumptions governing the use of PRP and its method of operation are discussed
below.
<p>PRP assumptions
<p>Performance-related pay rests heavily on three assumptions:
<p>that individual differences in performance can be accurately and fairly measured; &bull;
<p>that pay differences can be fairly related to performance differences and can be seen to &bull;
be related;
<p>that individuals will increase their efforts to gain more rewards, resulting in increased &bull;
performance.
<p>These assumptions are difficult to justify. Fair measurement is hard in any situation where
outcomes cannot be quantified, and this is the most typical situation. Relating pay fairly to
performance can be subject to partiality or prejudice. The success of PRP largely depends on
the line managers who make pay recommendations, and they are not necessarily equipped
with the skills or the powers of judgement required to do so fairly and consistently.
<p>In addition, the effectiveness of PRP as an incentive is highly questionable. As normally oper-
ated it fails to meet the requirements of expectancy theory in three critical ways: 1) people are
too often unclear about what they have to do to get a reward, 2) people do not necessarily
expect that they will get a reward, and 3) they do not expect that the reward will be worthwhile
(the amounts available for distribution, typically around 3 per cent of pay, are far too small to
act as an incentive). PRP schemes also fail the fifth criteria for contingent pay listed above, in
that the reward is usually made annually and therefore fails to follow as closely as possible the
accomplishment that generated it. Moreover, they usually rely on potentially subjective and
inaccurate ratings. As Murphy and Cleveland (1995) concluded following their extensive
review of performance appraisal: &lsquo;It is surprisingly difficult to determine whether or not per-
formance ratings provide valid and accurate indications of individuals&rsquo; performance.&rsquo; And
research carried out by Viswesvaran et al (1996) established the mean inter-rater reliability of
supervisory ratings of overall job performance was only .52.
<p>Methods of operating PRP
<p>Methods of operating PRP vary considerably but its typical main features are modelled in
Figure 10.2 and described below.
<p>The basis of the scheme is that pay increases are related to the achievement of agreed results
defined as targets or outcomes. Scope is provided for consolidated pay progression within pay
brackets attached to grades or levels in a graded or career/job-family structure or zones in a
broad-banded structure. Such increases are permanent.</p>

<p>Performance
pay Performance Rating Formula
<p>Figure 10.2 Performance-related pay model
<p>A formula in the shape of a pay matrix as illustrated in Figure 10.3 is often used to decide on
the size of increases. This indicates the percentage increase payable for different performance
ratings according to the position of the individual&rsquo;s pay in the pay range. This is sometimes
referred to as an individual &lsquo;compa-ratio&rsquo; (short for comparison ratio) and expresses pay as a
percentage of the mid-point in a range. A compa-ratio of 100 per cent means that the salary
would be at the mid-point.
<p>Pay progression in a graded structure is typically planned to decelerate through the grade for
two reasons. First, it is argued in line with learning curve theory that pay increases should be
higher during the earlier period in a job when learning is at its highest rate. Second, it may be
assumed that the central or reference point in a grade represents the market value of fully
competent people. Depending on the pay policy of the organization, this may be at or higher
than the median. Especially in the latter case, it may be believed that employees should progress
quite quickly to that level but, because beyond it they are already being paid well, their pay
need not increase so rapidly. This notion is reasonable but it can be difficult to explain to
people why they get smaller percentage increases when they are performing well at the upper
end of their scale.
<p>Alternatively or additionally, high levels of performance or special achievements may be
rewarded by cash bonuses that are not consolidated and have to be re-earned. Individuals may
be eligible for such bonuses when they have reached the top of the pay bracket for their grade,
or when they are assessed as being fully competent, having completely progressed along their
learning curve. The rate of pay for someone who reaches the required level of competence can
be aligned to market rates according to the organization&rsquo;s pay policy.

<br>
<p>172 Performance and Reward
<p>Another approach is to define performance zones in a pay range as in the following examples.
<p>XANSA
<p>Salary ranges are divided into three levels:
<p>Entry level typically represents employees who are new to the job, meeting some objec- &bull;
tives and demonstrating some of the skills and competencies at the required level.
<p>Market average typically represents employees who either consistently meet their &bull;
objectives and demonstrate many of the skills and competencies at the required level,
or who meet most but not all objectives and consistently demonstrate all of the skills
and competencies at the required level.
<p>High level typically represents employees who meet all objectives and exceed some, and &bull;
who demonstrate all of the skills and competencies at the required level and some at a
higher level.
<p>Nationwide
<p>The majority of ranges consist of a target rate (100 per cent of the median market rate), a
minimum (80 per cent), and a maximum (120 per cent). People tend to enter the range at the
minimum. Progression thereafter is solely by means of performance. Each year, pay scales are
uplifted by the percentage paid to &lsquo;good&rsquo; performers. The percentage increases paid to indi-
viduals are applied to the target, rather than their own salaries, ensuring that everyone on a
particular range with the same performance rating receives the same amount of money; that
is, the same effort is guaranteed the same reward.
<p>Employees who start on the minimum of a range are guaranteed progression to the target in
three years if they receive consistently &lsquo;good&rsquo; performance ratings. Those rated higher receive
enhanced progression. Once the target has been reached, employees get the percentage increase
resulting from their performance rating based on their target salary. This means that &lsquo;good&rsquo;
performers will stay at the target, since this (and the rest of the scales) is uprated by the per-
centage given to good performers, while better performers will move beyond the target towards
the maximum.
<p>Conclusions on PRP
<p>PRP has all the advantages and disadvantages listed in Chapter 8 for any form of financial
reward. Many people feel the latter outweigh the former. It has attracted a lot of adverse
comment, primarily because of the difficulties organizations have met in managing it but also
because it is uni-dimensional in that it is only concerned with results and not how the results </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Contingent Pay Schemes 173
<p>are achieved. Contribution-related pay schemes, which aim to overcome the latter problem,
are becoming more popular.
<p>Contribution-related pay
<p>Contribution-related pay as modelled in Figures 10.4 and 10.5 provides a basis for making pay
decisions that are related to assessments of both the outcomes of the work carried out by indi-
viduals and their inputs in terms of the levels of competency that have influenced these out-
comes. It focuses on what people in organizations are there to do: that is, to contribute by their
skill and efforts to the achievement of the purpose of their organization or team. In some
schemes the rewards are related to contributions both to achieving results and to upholding
corporate core values.
<p>Contribution-related pay is a holistic process that takes into account all aspects of a person&rsquo;s
performance in accordance with Brumbach&rsquo;s (1988) view that performance means both
behaviours and results.
<p>The case for contribution-related pay was made by Brown and Armstrong (1999) as follows:
<p>Contribution captures the full scope of what people do, the level of skill and competence
they apply and the results they achieve, which all contribute to the organization achiev-
ing its long-term goals. Contribution pay works by applying the mixed model of per-
formance management: assessing inputs and outputs and coming to a conclusion on
the level of pay for people in their roles and their work; both in the organization and in
the market; taking into account both past performance and future potential.

<p>174 Performance and Reward
<p>However, there is the difficulty of measurement. It is hard enough to measure performance
when outputs cannot be quantified, and it is even more difficult objectively to measure the
level of competency. This is the problem of purely relating pay to competency as discussed
later.
<p>Main features
<p>The main features of contribution-related pay are modelled in Figure 10.6.
<p>An example of a pay for contribution scheme based on a balanced score card in a UK bank is
shown in Figure 10.7.
<p>Methods of deciding contribution awards
<p>There are six basic approaches as described below.
<p>Matrix formula
<p>Pay awards are governed by assessments of performance and competency, and the amount is
determined by a pay matrix such as the one illustrated in Figure 10.8.
<p>This approach is rather mechanistic.

<p>Separate consolidated increases and bonuses
<p>Output is the only factor that governs cash bonuses but competency is the major component
in determining base pay, on the grounds that the latter is paid for what people are capable of
doing while the former rewards them for what they have already achieved.
<p>Relate consolidated increases to competence up to a reference point and then
pay cash bonuses for exceptional performance
<p>This is a development of the second approach. Its main features are:
<p>A &lsquo;reference point&rsquo; rate of pay is determined within each grade, band or level, which &bull;
includes jobs of broadly equal size.
<p>The reference point is defined as the rate of pay for a person in a job who is highly com- &bull;
petent, ie fully competent in all aspects of the job and therefore achieving high levels of
performance.
<p>The reference point takes account of both internal relativities and market rates. &bull;
<p>The level of comparison for market rates is in accordance with the pay policy of the &bull;
organization &ndash; this might be to set at above the median, eg at the upper quartile, to
ensure that the high quality of staff required can be attracted and retained.
<p>The reference point is the maximum level of consolidated pay a high performer can &bull;
expect to attain.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>176 Performance and Reward
<p>A minimum level of pay for each grade is determined and progression to the reference point &bull;
depends upon achieving defined levels of competence &ndash; there may be three or four levels.
<p>There is scope to reward those who perform exceptionally well with a re-earnable cash &bull;
bonus, which could be consolidated if the level of exceptional performance is sustained
over two to three years up to a maximum level defined for the grade.
<p>A version of this contribution scheme developed for the Shaw Trust is modelled in Figure 10.9.
<p>Rewards as either consolidated increases or bonuses
<p>In this approach, as illustrated in Figure 10.10, performers can earn a mix of base pay increase
and bonus that varies according to their position in the pay range. However, in this example,
all outstanding performers receive a payment of 10 per cent of their base pay. Line managers
would therefore not have to pass on the difficult message to outstanding individuals who are
high in their pay range that they would be getting a smaller increase in spite of their contribu-
tion (this would be the case in a scheme using a typical PRP matrix as illustrated in Figure
10.3). Here, the higher up the range individuals are, the greater the proportion of their increase
that is payable as a bonus. So those high in the range who are assessed as outstanding get 8 per
cent as bonus and 2 per cent addition to their base pay, while outstanding individuals low in
their range and below their market rates would get an 8 per cent addition to their base pay and
a 2 per cent bonus.
<p>Threshold payments
<p>This method can be used to provide a measure of contingent pay related to contribution in a pay
spine with progression based on fixed increments. A threshold is built into the pay range, as illus-
trated in Figure 10.11 for an incremental payment scheme. To cross the threshold into a higher
part of the range individuals must meet contribution criteria that will define the level of compe-
tence required and indicate any performance (outcome) criteria that may be relevant.

<p>Threshold systems may be particularly relevant where there is a large pay span in a grade, as in
some incremental scales, and it is felt that progression needs to be controlled. They could be
regarded as a halfway house to a full contribution pay scheme and, because they do not rely on
a suspect formula and contain defined and transparent criteria, they may be more acceptable
to staff and trade unions. However, their effectiveness depends on the definition of clear and
assessable criteria and the willingness of all those concerned to assess contribution on the basis
of evidence about the extent to which individuals meet the criteria. Judgements are still
involved and the system depends on the ability of managers to exercise them fairly and con-
sistently and to be prepared to make hard decisions on the basis of objective evidence that may
mean that staff do not progress through the threshold. There is a real danger that if managers
do not have the courage of their convictions, staff will more or less automatically progress
through the thresholds as happened in the time of &lsquo;merit bars&rsquo;, although the criteria for cross-
ing those bars were seldom defined explicitly.
<p>Holistic assessment
<p>A holistic approach can be adopted to assessing the level of contribution and therefore possi-
ble awards in the shape of base pay increases or bonuses. This approach leads to a decision on </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>178 Performance and Reward
<p>the level of pay appropriate for individuals in relation to the comparative levels of contribu-
tion of their peers and their own market worth, which will include consideration of their
potential and the need to retain them.
<p>Consideration is given both to what individuals have contributed to the success of their team
and to the level of competence they have achieved and deployed. Team members who are con-
tributing at the expected level will be paid at or around the reference point for the grade or
zone, and this reference point will be aligned to market rates in accordance with the organiza-
tion&rsquo;s market pay policies. If, in the judgement of the line manager, individuals are achieving
this level of contribution but are paid below their peers at the reference point, the pay of those
individuals would be brought up to the level of their peers, or towards that level if it is felt that
the increase should be phased. Individuals may be paid above the reference point if they are
making a particularly strong contribution or if their market worth is higher.
<p>The policy guideline would be that the average pay of those in the grade should broadly be in
line with the reference point (a compa-ratio of 100) unless there are special market rate con-
siderations that justify a higher rate. Those at or above the reference point who are contribut-
ing well could be eligible for a cash bonus. A &lsquo;pay pot&rsquo; would be made available for distribution,
with guidelines on how it should be used.
<p>This approach depends largely on the judgement of line managers, although they would be
guided and helped in the exercise of that judgement by HR. Its acceptability to staff as a fair
process depends on precise communications generally on how it operates and equally precise
communications individually on why decisions have been made. The assessment of contribu-
tion should be a joint one as part of performance management, and the link between that
assessment and the pay decision should be clear.
<p>Other characteristics
<p>The other characteristics of contribution pay are that:
<p>It is concerned with people as team members contributing to team performance, not &bull;
acting as individuals.
<p>It can operate flexibly &ndash; approaches may be varied between different groups of people. &bull;
<p>It is tailored to suit the business and HR strategy of the organization. &bull;
<p>There is a clear business-related rationale that serves stated HR and reward purposes &bull;
&ndash; individual and team contribution expectations are defined on the basis of the corpo-
rate and team business goals to be achieved and are measured accordingly.
<p>It operates transparently &ndash; everyone understands how the scheme operates and how it &bull;
affects them, and staff and their representatives will have contributed to the design of
the system and will take part in regular reviews of its effectiveness, leading to modifica-
tions when required.</p>

<p>Contingent Pay Schemes 179
<p>Example: paying for contribution at Kent County Council
<p>Kent County Council is unusual amongst local authorities in implementing for its staff an
approach to pay review and progression that rewards high performance, in line with its stated
goal, to improve the delivery of Kent County Council services. The approach is called Total
Contribution Pay (TCP) and was developed and implemented in 2005/06 on a phased basis.
The use of the word &lsquo;contribution&rsquo; and avoidance of performance-related pay terminology
was deliberate, and not just because Kent County Council was one of those authorities that
experimented with and abandoned PRP in the 1990s.
<p>The approach aims to &lsquo;maximize the contribution, skills and capability of all our employees&rsquo;,
that is to reward the &lsquo;how&rsquo; of someone&rsquo;s performance, as well as the results that they deliver. It
focuses on &lsquo;the day-to-day actions and behaviours&rsquo; of individuals to improve their perform-
ance, with the flexibility to appropriately reward those who achieve and contribute most.
<p>Total contribution is assessed through an annual appraisal process that considers four ele-
ments: the delivery of agreed objectives and accountabilities, how the job is done by incor-
porating a behavioural competency framework, achievement relative to a personal
development plan, and wider job contribution, which encapsulates everything else outside
of the job description.
<p>As part of the process, staff receive a rating on a five-point scale. On the basis of this rating,
they can achieve faster incremental progression through their pay scale. There is a strong
emphasis on fairness and consistency in ratings, and senior management review and moderate
the initial rating distributions produced.
<p>Conclusions on contribution pay
<p>Contribution-related pay provides a broader basis for pay decisions than performance-related
pay, and the concept of contribution is an attractive one in that it refers to the fundamental
reason why people are employed in organizations &ndash; to make a contribution to organizational
success. But contribution pay decisions depend on the measurement of both performance and
competency. Measuring performance is bad enough. Measuring competency is even worse.
The requirements for success are demanding and it is essential to ensure that the organization
is ready for contribution pay and to plan its introduction with great care, including ample
consultation and involvement. Organizations should never rush into contribution pay &ndash; more
time than is usually thought necessary is needed to plan and implement it.</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>180 Performance and Reward
<p>Competency-related pay
<p>The main features of competency-related pay schemes are illustrated in Figure 10.12 and
described below.
<p>Method of operation
<p>People receive financial rewards in the shape of increases to their base pay by reference to the
level of competency they demonstrate in carrying out their roles. It is a method of paying
people for the ability to perform now and in the future. As in the case of PRP, scope is pro-
vided for consolidated pay progression within pay brackets attached to grades or levels in a
narrow graded or career-family structure, or zones in a broad-banded structure (competence
pay is often regarded as a feature of such structures). The rate and limits of progression through
the pay brackets can be based on ratings of competence using a PRP type matrix, but they may
be governed by more general assessments of competence development.
<p>Conclusions on competency-related pay
<p>Competency-related pay is attractive in theory because it can be part of an integrated compe-
tency-based approach to HRM. It fits with the concept of human capital management, which
emphasizes the skills and competencies people bring with them to the workplace. It is all about
&lsquo;paying for the person&rsquo;. As Brown and Armstrong (1999) comment: &lsquo;Increasingly, organiza-
tions are finding that success depends on a competent workforce. Paying for competency
means that an organization is looking forward, not back.&rsquo; Pay based on competency avoids the
overemphasis in PRP schemes on quantitative and often unrealistic targets. It is appealing
because it rewards people for what they are capable of doing, not for results over which they
might have little control. However, as the 2009 e-reward survey showed, it is much less popular
than performance or contribution pay.
<p>There are three reasons for this. First, there is the problem of measurement. As Sparrow (1996)
suggested, difficulties arise because of deciding the performance criteria on which competen-
cies are based, the complex nature of what is being measured and the relevance of the results
to the organization. He concluded that &lsquo;we should avoid over-egging our ability to test,
measure and reward competencies.&rsquo; Second, there is the problem raised by Sparrow of answer-
ing the question &lsquo;what are we paying for?&rsquo; Are we paying for behavioural competencies, ie

<p>Contingent Pay Schemes 181
<p>how people behave, or technical competencies (competences), ie what people have to know
and be able to do to perform well? If we are just rewarding behaviour (competencies) then
this increases the measurement difficulties. The third reason was explained by Lawler (1993).
He expresses concern about schemes that pay for an individual&rsquo;s personality traits and
emphasizes that such plans work best &lsquo;when they are tied to the ability of an individual to
perform a particular task and when there are valid measures available of how well an indi-
vidual can perform a task&rsquo;. He also points out that &lsquo;generic competencies are not only hard
to measure, they are not necessarily related to successful task performance in a particular
work assignment or work role.&rsquo;
<p>This raises another question: &lsquo;Are we paying for the possession of competency or the use of
competency?&rsquo; Clearly it must be the latter. But we can only assess the effective use of compe-
tency by reference to performance. The focus is therefore on results and if that is the case,
competency-related pay begins to look suspiciously like performance-related pay. Perhaps the
difference between the two is all &lsquo;smoke and mirrors&rsquo;. Competency-related pay could be
regarded as no more than a more acceptable name for PRP.
<p>It has also been noted by Zingheim and Schuster (2002) that pay systems built round compe-
tencies are:
<p>complex and over-designed; &bull;
<p>vague and ambiguous; &bull;
<p>laborious and time consuming; &bull;
<p>disconnected from the labour market; &bull;
<p>tentatively championed and communicated. &bull;
<p>There may be a case for rewarding the possession of competency but there is an even stronger
one for linking the reward to outcomes (performance) as well as inputs (competency). This is
the basis of the notion of contribution-related pay as described above and provides the expla-
nation for the growing popularity of that approach compared with the more rarefied notion
of competency-related pay.
<p>Skill-based pay
<p>Skill-based pay provides employees with a direct link between their pay progression and the
skills they have acquired and can use effectively. It focuses on what skills the business wants to
pay for and what employees must do to demonstrate them. It is therefore a people-based
rather than a job-based approach to pay. Rewards are related to the employee&rsquo;s ability to apply
a wider range or a higher level of skills to different jobs or tasks. It is not linked simply with the
scope of a defined job or a prescribed set of tasks.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>182 Performance and Reward
<p>A skill may be defined broadly as a learned ability that improves with practice in time. For
skill-based pay purposes the skills must be relevant to the work. Skill-based pay is also known
as knowledge-based pay, but the terms are used interchangeably, knowledge being regarded
loosely as the understanding of how to do a job or certain tasks.
<p>Skill-based pay was originally applied mainly to operatives in manufacturing firms, but it has
been extended to technicians and workers in retailing, distribution, catering and other service
industries. The broad equivalent of skill-based pay for managerial, professional and adminis-
trative staff and knowledge workers is competency-related pay, which refers to expected
behaviour as well as often to knowledge and skill requirements. There is clearly a strong family
resemblance between skill and competency-related pay &ndash; they are both person-based pay
schemes. But they can be distinguished both by the way in which they are applied, as described
below and by the criteria used.
<p>Method of operation
<p>Skill-based pay works as follows:
<p>Skill blocks or modules are defined. These incorporate individual skills or clusters of &bull;
skills that workers need to use and that will be rewarded by extra pay when they have
been acquired and the employee has demonstrated the ability to use them effectively.
<p>The skill blocks are arranged in a hierarchy, with natural break points between clearly &bull;
definable different levels of skills.
<p>The successful completion of a skill module or skill block will result in an increment in &bull;
pay. This will define how the pay of individuals can progress as they gain extra skills.
<p>Methods of verifying that employees have acquired and can use the skills at defined &bull;
levels are established.
<p>Arrangements for &lsquo;cross-training&rsquo; are made. These will include learning modules and &bull;
training programmes for each skill block.
<p>Conclusions on skill-based pay
<p>Skill-based pay systems are expensive to introduce and maintain. They require a considerable
investment in skill analysis, training and testing. Although in theory a skill-based scheme will
pay only for necessary skills, in practice individuals will not be using them all at the same time
and some may be used infrequently, if at all. Inevitably, therefore, payroll costs will rise. If this
increase is added to the cost of training and certification, the additional costs may be consider-
able. The advocates of skill-based pay claim that their schemes are self-financing because of
the resulting increases in productivity and operational efficiency, but there is little evidence
that such is the case. For this reason, skill-base schemes have never been as popular as the
other forms of contingent pay in the UK.</p>

<p>Contingent Pay Schemes 183
<p>Overall conclusions on contingent pay
<p>There are strong arguments against contingent pay, especially those referring to the problems
of measurement and assessment and therefore perceived fairness that exist in all the varieties
described in this chapter. Steps can be taken to reduce the problems through extensive consul-
tation and communications, effective performance management processes, providing training
and guidance to line managers, and monitoring the operation and impact of the contingent
pay scheme carefully. However, it is very difficult to overcome them completely.
<p>But what is the alternative? One answer is to rely more on non-financial motivators, although
it is still necessary to consider what should be done about pay. The traditional alternative is
service-related pay. This certainly treats everyone equally (and therefore appeals to trade
unions) but pays people simply for being there and this could be regarded as inequitable in
that rewards take no account of relative levels of contribution. Two other alternatives are
team-based pay and pay based on organizational performance. But the former still has meas-
urement difficulties and other problems, as described in Chapter 12, and has never become
really popular, while the rewards provided by the latter, although they may increase commit-
ment to the organization, are too remote from the day-to-day activities of most employees to
make any real impact on performance.
<p>Another alternative is a spot rate job-based system. Most people, however, want and expect a
range of base pay progression or some other method of payment for results such as cash
bonuses.
<p>It is because none of these alternatives adequately satisfies the natural inclination of people
to believe that individuals who contribute more should be paid more that contingent pay
schemes are common in the private sector (according to the CIPD 2009 survey, 89 per cent
of private sector service organizations and 85 per cent of manufacturing organizations have
them), although they are used less in the public and voluntary sectors (33 and 30 per cent
respectively).
<p>Contingent pay schemes, whatever their faults, are here to stay. What is evident is that they are
difficult to manage and considerable care and effort is therefore required when designing and
operating them.

<p>Introduction
<p>Bonuses in the form of cash payments are an increasingly important part of the remuneration
package. They received a very bad press during the banking crisis of 2008&ndash;09 due to what was
perceived to be excessively high rewards for failure and to the belief that the attraction of
astronomic bonuses led to excessive risk taking with other people&rsquo;s money. Clearly, bonus

<br>

<br>
<p>188 Performance and Reward
<p>schemes can go wrong, especially when the &lsquo;moral hazard&rsquo; is present of striving to obtain
higher rewards by manipulating results or focusing on easy short-term gains rather than the
tougher long-term goals. However, the worst excesses have applied to directors and senior
executives as discussed in Chapter 20 rather than other staff. There is a case for bonus pay-
ments to the latter if the scheme is properly based and well administered. Certainly, bonus
schemes are popular. The CIPD 2009 reward survey found that 61 per cent of respondents had
schemes rewarding individual results, 56 per cent had schemes driven by business results and
41 per cent had combination schemes rewarding both individual and business results.
<p>This chapter starts with definitions of what bonus schemes aim to achieve and their justifica-
tion. It continues with a list of the criteria for bonus schemes, which leads to an analysis of the
different types of bonus schemes and who can be covered by them. The chapter ends with a
summary of how they can be designed and introduced.
<p>Bonus schemes defined
<p>Bonus schemes provide cash payments to employees that are related to the performance of
their organization, their team or themselves, or a combination of two or more of these. Bonuses
are often referred to as &lsquo;variable pay&rsquo; or &lsquo;pay-at-risk&rsquo;.
<p>A defining characteristic of a bonus is that it has to be re-earned, unlike increases arising from
contingent pay schemes such as performance or contribution-related pay or pay related to
service, which are consolidated into base pay. Such payments can be described as annuities or
&lsquo;gifts that go on giving&rsquo;.
<p>Cash bonuses may be the sole method of providing people with rewards in addition to their
base pay, or they may be paid on top of individual contingent pay.
<p>Aims of bonus schemes
<p>The aims of bonus schemes may differ, but typically, they include one or more of the following:
<p>to enable people to share in the success of the organization and therefore increase their &bull;
commitment to it;
<p>to provide rewards related to business performance so as to increase motivation, com- &bull;
mitment and engagement;
<p>to provide a reward that recognizes past performance or achievements and encourages &bull;
individuals and teams to perform well in the future;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Bonus Schemes 189
<p>to provide a direct incentive that increases motivation and engagement and generates &bull;
higher future levels of individual and team performance;
<p>to ensure that pay levels are competitive and will attract and retain good-quality &bull;
people.
<p>Rationale for bonus schemes
<p>Bonuses can provide a reward for a special achievement and be used to provide financial
recognition to people who are at the top of the salary range for their grade and are continu-
ing to perform. Lump-sum payments can sometimes make a bigger impact on people (they
can go out and spend them) than incremental increases spread thinly out over a year. Overall
they contribute to the creation of a high-performance culture and make a positive impact
on bottom-line results.
<p>The business cases made by a number of respondents to the 2006 e-reward survey of bonus
schemes are given below:
<p>&lsquo;The bonus structures are such that they are self-financing when people are over the &bull;
100 per cent to target levels. As the 100 per cent target level is set at the budget level,
everything over this is of added benefit. The structure of the schemes also has a higher
weighting of the products with more margin, which again helps to self-finance the
schemes.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;The industry is driven by margins and total operating profit at branch and regional &bull;
levels, so the bonus schemes reflect this requirement to deliver. The schemes are rigor-
ously enforced and tested by finance.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;We have a pay-for-performance culture and in turn recognize and award high achiev- &bull;
ers. This is a key driver in motivating employees and organizational performance.&rsquo;
<p>&lsquo;The bonus scheme is a key to attaining scorecard performance at levels necessary to &bull;
achieve the flexibility to manage costs finely in line with varying volumes of production
and the lowest margin products to ensure that the site can make a positive profit before
tax contribution.&rsquo;
<p>When considering the rationale it is necessary to evaluate the case for having a bonus scheme
either as an alternative to a more conventional individual contingent pay scheme (ie only pro-
viding cash bonuses), or as an addition to contingent pay (ie providing both cash bonuses and
the opportunity to earn contingent pay that is consolidated in base pay). The advantages and
disadvantages of these alternatives are summarized in Table 11.1.</p>

<p>Criteria for a bonus scheme
<p>An effective bonus scheme must:
<p>be based on realistic, significant and measurable key performance indicators; &bull;
<p>not create a moral hazard, ie an incentive to act inappropriately in pursuit of a high &bull;
bonus;
<p>not encourage the pursuit of short-term gains or engagement in unduly risky enter- &bull;
prises at the expense of longer-term and sustained success;
<p>never reward failure; &bull;
<p>only pay out if a demanding threshold of performance is achieved; &bull;
<p>provide a clear line of sight between effort or contribution and the reward; &bull;
<p>operate fairly, equitably, consistently and transparently; &bull;
<p>be appropriate for the type of people to whom it applies; &bull;</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Bonus Schemes 191
<p>contain arrangements to restrict (cap) the maximum payment to an acceptable sum; &bull;
<p>provide for review at regular intervals to decide whether the scheme needs to be &bull;
amended, replaced or cancelled;
<p>provide scope to moderate corporate bonuses by reference to personal performance. &bull;

<p>Bonuses based on organizational performance may be made available to all staff to provide a
general reward and encourage identification with the business. Such bonuses can be in addi-
tion to contingent pay. They are sometimes provided in organizations that have team pay for
certain categories of staff, for example branch staff in a financial services company, but are
unable to extend team payments to other categories of staff who do not work in such well-
defined teams. Combination plans may also be applied to all staff, although they are some-
times restricted to senior managers. Bonuses based on individual performance may also be
paid to all categories of staff or restricted to certain categories, such as directors or sales staff.
<p>Designing a bonus scheme
<p>The considerations affecting the design of a bonus scheme are set out below.
<p>Formula
<p>Every bonus scheme is different. In an individual scheme a single criterion such as profit
before tax may be used for directors, with a threshold performance level to generate a bonus
and a sliding scale up to a maximum that determines the size of the bonus. Alternatively, in a
scheme applying to all staff, ratings may be used that determine the size of the bonus for indi-
viduals or teams by reference to the extent to which objectives have been achieved.
<p>The formula for a combined scheme may be more complex:
<p>Table 11.2 continued</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>194 Performance and Reward
<p>Individual or team payments may only be made if a threshold level of organizational &bull;
performance is reached.
<p>The level of bonus related to organizational performance may be modified in accord- &bull;
ance with the level of individual performance achieved.
<p>There are many variations on the split between corporate and individual bonuses, &bull;
although a 50/50 division is quite common.
<p>The split may vary at different levels, providing a greater proportion of bonus for cor- &bull;
porate performance at higher levels.
<p>Examples of the formulae used by the e-reward survey respondents are given in Table 11.3.

<p>Group-wide business performance. Individual element &lsquo;flexes&rsquo; the
maximum business performance downward for bad performance &ndash; eg if
rating &lsquo;1&rsquo; to &lsquo;3&rsquo;, get the full bonus; rating &lsquo;4&rsquo;, the business performance
bonus is reduced by 25%; a &lsquo;5&rsquo; rating by 50%; a &lsquo;6&rsquo; rating gets zero award.
<p>Business performance creates a bonus opportunity for an individual, which
is then flexed according to a personal performance factor.</p>

<p>Bonus Schemes 195
<p>Introducing a bonus scheme
<p>The actions required when introducing a scheme are:
<p>Consult with those concerned on the purpose and features of the scheme. &bull;
<p>Define responsibilities for introducing, maintaining and evaluating the scheme. &bull;
<p>Pilot test it if at all possible in a department or division or a representative sample of &bull;
employees to obtain information on how well the formula works, the appropriateness
of the measures, the cost of the scheme, its impact, the effectiveness of the process of
making decisions on bonuses (eg the application of performance management) and
the reactions of staff.
<p>Make amendments as necessary in the light of the test. &bull;
<p>Prepare a description for communication to staff of the purpose of the scheme, how it &bull;
works and how staff will be affected.
<p>Ensure that the scheme is bedded down in the organization&rsquo;s day-to-day operating &bull;
processes, including management reports and performance reviews.
<p>Draw up a budget for the costs of the scheme. &bull;
<p>Define operating and control processes including responsibilities, the achievement of &bull;
fairness and consistency and cost control.
<p>Prepare a plan for introducing the scheme, covering the agreement of performance &bull;
indicators and targets, methods of reviewing performance, the process of deciding on
bonus payments and communications.
<p>Bonus schemes: six tips
Base the scheme on realistic, significant and measurable key performance &bull;
indicators.
<p>Do not create a moral hazard, ie an incentive to act inappropriately in pursuit &bull;
of a high bonus.
<p>Do not encourage the pursuit of short-term gains or engage in unduly risky &bull;
enterprises at the expense of longer-term and sustained success.
<p>Never reward failure. &bull;
<p>Only pay out if a demanding threshold of performance is achieved. &bull;
<p>Provide a clear line of sight between effort or contribution and the reward. &bull;</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Two factors have combined to create interest in rewarding teams rather than individuals. The
first is the significance attached to good teamwork and the belief that team pay would enhance
it, and the second is dissatisfaction with the individual nature of performance-related pay,
which is believed to be prejudicial to teamwork. The notion of team pay appeals to many
people but the number of organizations who use it is relatively small. The e-reward 2009
survey of contingent pay found that only 11 per cent of respondents had team pay.

<p>198 Performance and Reward
<p>Team pay is an attractive idea but one difficult to put into practice The reason for the limited
number of schemes may be that organizations find it hard to meet the quite exacting condi-
tions for team pay set out later in this chapter. Others may believe that they have to focus their
incentive schemes on individual rather than group effort.
<p>This chapter starts with a definition of team pay and its aims and rationale, and continues with
a description of how team pay works, an analysis of the arguments for and against team pay
and suggestions on how team pay can be introduced. It ends with a summary of the outcomes
of research into a team project in the NHS with mixed results that illustrates some of the dif-
ficulties with team rewards.
<p>Team pay defined
<p>Team pay links payments to members of a formally established team to the performance of
that team. The rewards are shared among the members of the team in accordance with a pub-
lished formula or on an ad hoc basis in the case of exceptional achievements. Rewards for indi-
viduals may also be influenced by assessments of their contribution to team results. To
appreciate how team pay works it is necessary to understand the nature of a team and the
various types of teams to which it can apply.
<p>The nature of a team
<p>A team has been defined by Katzenbach and Smith (1993) as &lsquo;A small number of people with
complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals and
approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable&rsquo;.
<p>Types of teams
<p>There are four types of teams as described below.
<p>Organizational teams
<p>These consist of individuals who are linked together organizationally as members of, for
example, the &lsquo;top management team&rsquo;, departmental heads in an operational or research divi-
sion, section heads or team leaders in a department, or even people carrying out distinct and
often separate functions, as long as they are all contributing to the achievement of the objec-
tives of their department or section.
<p>Members of organizational teams can be related to one another by the requirement to achieve
an overall objective, but this may be loosely defined and the degree to which they act in consort
will vary considerably. In a sense, organizations are entirely constructed of such &lsquo;teams&rsquo;, but </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Team Pay 199
<p>team reward processes may be inappropriate unless their members are strongly united by a
common purpose and are clearly interdependent. If such is not the case, some form of bonus
related to organizational performance might be preferable.
<p>Work teams
<p>These are self-contained and permanent teams whose members work closely together to
achieve results in terms of output, the development of products or processes, or the delivery
of services to customers. This type of team will be focused on a common purpose and its
members will be interdependent &ndash; results are a function of the degree to which they can work
well together. It is for this type of team that continuing team pay reward schemes may be
appropriate as long as team targets can be established and team performance can be measured
accurately and fairly.
<p>Project teams
<p>These consist of people brought together from different functions to complete a task lasting
several months to several years. When the project is completed the team disbands. Examples
include product development teams or a team formed to open a new plant. Project teams may
be rewarded with cash bonuses payable on satisfactory completion of the project to specifica-
tion, on time and within the cost budget. Interim &lsquo;milestone&rsquo; payments may be made as pre-
determined stages of the project are completed satisfactorily.
<p>Ad hoc teams
<p>These are functional or cross-functional teams set up to deal with an immediate problem.
They are usually short-lived and operate as a task force. It is unusual to pay bonuses to such
teams unless they deliver exceptional results.
<p>Aim of team pay
<p>The aim of team pay is to encourage and reinforce the sort of behaviour that leads to and sus-
tains effective team performance by:
<p>providing incentives and other means of recognizing team achievements; &bull;
<p>clarifying what teams are expected to achieve by relating rewards to the attainment of &bull;
predetermined and agreed targets and standards of performance, or to the satisfactory
completion of a project or a stage of a project;
<p>conveying the message that one of the organization&rsquo;s core values is effective teamwork. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>200 Performance and Reward
<p>Rationale for team pay
<p>There are four reasons for team pay:
<p>Teams are the natural unit in organizations and it is appropriate to reward them as &bull;
such.
<p>Team pay encourages good teamwork while performance pay that encourages indi- &bull;
vidual effort militates against it.
<p>Team performance measures are often the only ones available; measuring output at an &bull;
individual level can be difficult, especially in the public sector.
<p>As noted by Prentice &bull; et al (2007) on the basis of their research, team incentives can help
to promote peer monitoring in smaller teams, particularly when team members are
mutually dependent on each other to achieve results.
<p>How team pay works
<p>The most common method of providing team pay is to distribute a cash sum related to team
performance amongst team members. There are a number of formulas and ways of distribut-
ing team pay as described below.
<p>The team pay formula
<p>This establishes the relationship between team performance, as measured or assessed in quan-
titative or qualitative terms, and the reward. It also fixes the size of the bonus pool or fund
earned by the team to be distributed among its members, or the scale of payments made to
team members, in relation to team performance with regard to certain criteria. Bonuses may
be related to performance in such specific areas as sales, throughput, achievement of targets in
the form of the delivery of results for a project, levels of service or an index of customer satis-
faction. Targets are agreed and performance is measured against the targets.
<p>Alternatively bonuses may be related to an overall criterion, which can be a more subjective
assessment of the contribution of the team to organizational performance.
<p>Method of distributing bonuses
<p>Bonuses can be distributed to team members in the form of either a percentage of base salary
or the same sum for each member, usually based on a scale of payments. Payment of bonus as
a percentage of base salary is the most popular method. The assumption behind it is that base
salary reflects the value of the individual&rsquo;s contribution to the team. The correctness of this </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Team Pay 201
<p>assumption clearly depends on the extent to which base salary truly indicates the level of per-
formance of individuals as team members.
<p>Team pay and individual pay
<p>Some organizations pay team bonuses only. A minority pay individual bonuses as well,
which are often related to an assessment of the competence of the person thus, it is thought,
providing encouragement to develop skills and rewarding individuals for their particular
contribution.
<p>Dealing with high and low individual performance in a team
<p>It is sometimes assumed by advocates of team pay that all members of a team contribute
equally and should therefore be rewarded equally. In practice the contribution of individual
team members will vary and if this is the case, for example, in shopfloor groups, team pressure
may be forcing everyone to work at the same rate so as to avoid &lsquo;rate busting&rsquo;. This is an
example of how a highly cohesive team can work against the interests of the organization.
<p>When designing a team pay scheme, decisions have to be made on the likelihood that some
people will perform better or worse than others. It may be decided that, even if this happens,
it would be invidious and detrimental to single anyone out for different treatment. It could,
however, be considered that &lsquo;special achievement&rsquo; or &lsquo;sustained high-performance&rsquo; bonuses
should be payable to individuals who make an exceptional contribution, while poor perform-
ers should receive a lower bonus or no bonus at all.
<p>Project team bonuses
<p>The design considerations described above apply to permanent work teams. Different arrange-
ments are required for project teams specially set up to achieve a task and, usually, disbanded
after the task has been completed. Project team bonuses should, wherever possible, be self-
financing &ndash; they should be related to increases in income or productivity or cost savings arising
from the project. Project teams can be set targets and their bonuses can be linked with achiev-
ing or surpassing targeted results. Alternatively, a fixed bonus can be promised if the project is
on time, meets the specification and does not exceed the cost budget. The bonus could be
increased for early completion or to reflect cost savings. For lengthy projects, interim pay-
ments may be made at defined &lsquo;milestones&rsquo;.
<p>Ad hoc bonuses
<p>Where there are no predetermined arrangements for paying bonuses to teams, a retrospective
bonus can be paid to a project or ad hoc team in recognition of exceptional achievement.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>202 Performance and Reward
<p>Requirements for team pay
<p>Team pay works best if teams:
<p>stand alone as performing units for which clear targets and standards can be agreed and &bull;
outputs measured;
<p>have a considerable degree of autonomy: team pay is likely to be most effective in self- &bull;
managed teams;
<p>are composed of people whose work is interdependent: it is acknowledged by members &bull;
that the team will deliver the expected results only if they work well together and share
the responsibility for success;
<p>are stable: members are used to working with one another, know what is expected of &bull;
them by fellow team members and know where they stand in the regard of those
members;
<p>are mature: teams are well established, used to working flexibly to meet targets and &bull;
deadlines, and capable of making good use of the complementary skills of their
members.
<p>These are exacting requirements. If they can be met there may be a good case for team pay.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of team pay
<p>Team pay can:
<p>encourage teamworking and co-operative behaviour; &bull;
<p>enhance flexible working within teams and encourage multiskilling, clarify team goals &bull;
and priorities and provide for the integration of organizational and team objectives;
<p>encourage less effective performers to improve in order to meet team standards; &bull;
<p>serve as a means of developing self-managed or self-directed teams. &bull;
<p>But:
<p>The effectiveness of team pay depends on the existence of well-defined and mature &bull;
teams, and they may be difficult to identify. Even if they can be identified, do they need
to be motivated by a purely financial reward?
<p>Team pay may seem unfair to individuals who could feel that their own efforts are &bull;
unrewarded.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Team Pay 203
<p>Pressure to conform, which is accentuated by team pay, could result in the team main- &bull;
taining its output at lowest common denominator levels &ndash; sufficient to gain what is
thought collectively to be a reasonable reward but no more.
<p>It can be difficult to develop performance measures and methods of rating team per- &bull;
formance that are seen to be fair. Team pay formulae may well be based on arbitrary
assumptions about the correct relationship between effort and reward.
<p>There may be pressure from employees to migrate from poorly performing teams to &bull;
high-performing teams. If this is allowed, it could cause disruption and stigmatize the
teams from which individuals transfer, while if it is refused, it could leave dissatisfied
employees in the inadequate teams, making them even worse.
<p>For many organizations, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.
<p>Developing team pay
<p>If, in spite of the problems that may beset team pay, it is decided to introduce it, the develop-
ment steps are as follows:
<p>1. Initial analysis
<p> This should identify whether there are teams that satisfy the requirements set out above.
<p>2. Select teams
<p> Decide on which teams will be eligible for team pay.
<p>3. Scheme design
<p> Decide the team bonus formula (the criteria to be used in judging performance, the
amount available for team pay and the method of distributing team pay).
<p>4. Scheme introduction.
<p>Team pay is likely to be unfamiliar and should therefore be introduced with care, especially if it
is replacing an existing system of individual PRP. The process will be easier if employees have
been involved in developing the scheme, but it is still essential to communicate in detail to all
employees the reasons for introducing team pay, how it will work and how it will affect them.
<p>It is easier to introduce team pay into mature teams whose members are used to working
together, trust one another and can recognize that team pay will work to their mutual advan-
tage. Although it may seem an attractive proposition to use team pay as a means of welding
new work teams together, there are dangers in forcing people who are already having to
adapt to a different situation to accept a radical change in their method of remuneration. It
should be remembered that it may not be easy to get people in work teams to think of their </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>204 Performance and Reward
<p>performance in terms of how it impacts on others. It can take time for employees to adapt
to a system in which a proportion of their pay is based on team achievement.
<p>When it comes to launching team pay it may be advisable to pilot it initially in one or two well-
established teams. Experience gained from the pilot scheme can then be used to modify the
scheme before it is extended elsewhere. If the pilot scheme teams think it has been a success,
other teams may be more willing to convert to team pay.
<p>NHS case study
<p>As reported by Reilly et al (2005), the UK Department of Health decided to trial team pay in
NHS trusts. The 17 teams in the trial were based at a number of sites and were given targets
aimed at improving the patient experience through faster response, better service or an
improved environment. The team reward was a cash payment: money put into an &lsquo;improve-
ment fund&rsquo; for staff to spend on staff facilities/development or a mixture of the two.
<p>Many positive results were achieved by the trials. These included improvements in the man-
agement of the trusts and benefits to patients and staff. The end-of-pilot survey results gener-
ally elicited positive responses to questions relating to the operation of team-based pay. But as
the researchers involved in the survey observed: &lsquo;So far so good, but there are still question
marks over the success of the scheme. First, not all sites met their targets&hellip; and not every par-
ticipant was as keen about the benefits of the scheme. Second, even at the better performing
sites, did team-based pay drive service improvement, even if the staff thought it did?&rsquo;
<p>In the opinion of the researchers, the causes of relative failure in some trusts can be attributed
to the following three factors:
<p>Team structure: some people were excluded from teams, which they resented, and the &bull;
teams sometimes cut across natural groupings. But the size of the team and the degree
to which it was well established did not make much difference.
<p>Targets: there were a number of difficulties with targets. Some administrators found it &bull;
hard to specify output, let alone outcome measures. They felt happier with input
metrics. It was confirmed that the poorer the &lsquo;line of sight&rsquo; between work actions and
the target, the less likely there was to be employee engagement and thereby effort to
deliver. In particular, when targets were externally imposed, failure was more probable.
The degree of stretch in the targets varied greatly, but it did not always seem easy at the
outset to predict what would be hard to achieve and what would be easier.
<p>Matters outside the team&rsquo;s control: these genuinely affected the teams&rsquo; ability to deliver, &bull;
producing understandable criticism.
<p>The main conclusions reached by the researchers were that:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Team Pay 205
<p>Success depends on having a clear purpose, effective leadership, the trust of staff in the &bull;
integrity and competence of management, good communications and efficient project
management.
<p>The &lsquo;right&rsquo; size of team depends on the objectives of the exercise; for example, bigger &bull;
teams may be necessary to cope with complex processes and multiple targets.
<p>Targets need to be clear and simple, easy to communicate and evaluate, relate to the &bull;
work people do and seen as achievable and within the team&rsquo;s control.
<p>As with all schemes, team-based pay will only operate successfully for a limited period, &bull;
because employees fear that the performance bar will be continuously raised and the
discretionary effort that schemes tap into may not always be there to exploit.
<p>Team pay: six tips
Be clear about the objectives of team pay. &bull;
<p>Ensure that there are clearly defined teams in the organization for which the &bull;
results achieved by the joint efforts of team members can be measured.
<p>Involve team leaders and team members in developing the team pay scheme, &bull;
including methods of setting targets and measuring and monitoring
performance, and the formula used for calculating team pay.
<p>Provide training in team building and operating the scheme. &bull;
<p>Pilot test the scheme. &bull;
<p>Get teams involved in setting their own targets and monitoring their own &bull;
performance.

<p>Introduction
<p>Many organizations believe that their financial reward systems should extend beyond indi-
vidual contingent pay, which does not recognize collective effort, or team pay, which is diffi-
cult. They believe that their system should help to enhance engagement and commitment and
convince employees that they have a stake in the business as well as providing them with addi-
tional pay. The response to this belief is to offer financial rewards that are related to business
or organizational performance (sometimes known as company-wide or factory-wide schemes).
This is a popular form of reward &ndash; the 2009 e-reward reward survey found that 59 per cent of
respondents had such schemes.
<p>206 </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding for Business Performance 207
<p>Types of schemes
<p>The three types of formal business performance schemes are:
<p>Profit-sharing: the payment of sums in cash or shares related to the profits of the &bull;
business.
<p>Share ownership schemes: employees are given the opportunity to purchase shares in &bull;
the company; 29 per cent of the respondents to the 2009 CIPD survey had such
schemes.
<p>Gain-sharing: the payment of cash sums to employees related to the financial gains &bull;
made by the company because of its improved performance; only 3 per cent of the
CIPD 2009 respondents had such schemes.
<p>Less formally, managements can make decisions on the amount to be paid out in the form of
individual performance or contribution-related increments or individual/team cash bonuses.
These decisions are made on the basis of what they believe the organization can afford. This
creates what is sometimes called a &lsquo;pot&rsquo; from which payments are funded. The assessment of
affordability (a potent word for many managements) can determine pay review budgets on
the proportion of the pay roll, eg 3 per cent, that can be allocated for increments or bonuses.
<p>Aims
<p>The aims of relating rewards to business performance are to:
<p>increase the commitment of employees to the organization; &bull;
<p>enable employees to share in the success of the organization; &bull;
<p>stimulate more interest in the affairs of the organization; &bull;
<p>focus employees&rsquo; attention on what they can contribute to organizational success and &bull;
bring areas for improvement to their attention;
<p>obtain tax advantages for employees through approved share schemes &ndash; such &lsquo;tax-effi- &bull;
cient&rsquo; schemes enable the business to get better value for money from its expenditure
on employee remuneration.
<p>Perhaps the two most important reasons for organizational schemes are the beliefs that they
increase the identification of employees with the company and that the company is morally
bound to share its success with its employee stakeholders &ndash; those who collectively make a
major contribution to it. However, it is generally recognized that they do not provide a direct
incentive because the links between individual effort and the collective reward are too
remote.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>208 Performance and Reward
<p>Profit-sharing
<p>Profit-sharing is a plan under which an employer pays to eligible employees, as an addition to
their normal remuneration, special sums related to the profits of the business. The amount
shared is either determined by an established formula or entirely at the discretion of manage-
ment. As a percentage of pay, the value of profit shares varies considerably between compa-
nies, and within companies from year to year. Between 2 per cent and 5 per cent is a fairly
typical range of payments but it can be 20 per cent or more. It is unlikely that profit distribu-
tions of less than 5 per cent will make much impact on commitment, never mind motivation.
Employees tend to take the smallish sums they receive for granted.
<p>Profits can be distributed in the form of cash or shares, usually share options. The arrange-
ments for profit-sharing are concerned with eligibility, the basis for calculating profit shares
and the method of distribution. They vary considerably between companies.
<p>Eligibility
<p>In most schemes all employees except directors are eligible. A period of time, often one year&rsquo;s
service, is usually required before profit shares can be received.
<p>Basis of calculation
<p>There are three approaches to calculating profit shares:
<p>A predetermined formula: a fixed percentage of profits is distributed. This clarifies the &bull;
relationship of pay-out to profits and demonstrates the good faith of management, but
it lacks flexibility and the amount available may fluctuate widely.
<p>No predetermined formula: the board determines profit shares entirely at its own dis- &bull;
cretion in accordance with the directors&rsquo; assessment of what the company can afford.
This gives them complete control over the amount distributed but, because of the
secrecy involved, is at odds with the principle of getting employees more involved with
the organization. This is the most typical approach.
<p>A threshold formula: a profit threshold is set below which no profits will be distributed &bull;
and a maximum limit is defined. Between these, the board exercises discretion on the
amount to be distributed.
<p>Methods of distributing profit shares
<p>There are four methods of distribution:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding for Business Performance 209
<p>Percentage of pay with no allowance for service: this is a fairly common method that &bull;
recognizes that profit shares should be related to the employee&rsquo;s basic contribution as
measured by their level of pay, which takes into account service.
<p>Percentage of pay with an allowance for service: this approach is also frequently used &bull;
on the grounds that it rewards loyalty.
<p>Percentage of pay with an allowance for individual performance: this method is fairly &bull;
rare below board level because of the difficulty of measuring the relationship between
individual performance and profit.
<p>As a fixed sum irrespective of earnings, service or performance: this is an egalitarian &bull;
approach but is fairly rare.
<p>Share ownership schemes
<p>There are two main forms of share ownership plans: share incentive plans and save-as-you-
earn (SAYE) schemes. These can be Inland Revenue and Customs approved, and if so produce
tax advantages as well as linking financial rewards in the longer term to the prosperity of the
company.
<p>Share incentive plans
<p>Share incentive plans must be Inland Revenue and Customs approved. They provide employ-
ees with a tax-efficient way of purchasing shares in their organization, to which the employer
can add &lsquo;free&rsquo;, &lsquo;partnership&rsquo; or &lsquo;matching&rsquo; shares. There is a limit to the amount of free shares
that can be provided. Employees can use up a sum determined by the Inland Revenue and
Customs out of pre-tax and pre-National Insurance Contributions pay to buy partnership
shares, and employers can give matching shares at a ratio of up to two matching shares for
each partnership share.
<p>Save-as-you-earn schemes
<p>SAYE schemes must be Inland Revenue and Customs approved. They provide employees with
the option to buy shares in the company in three, five or seven years&rsquo; time at today&rsquo;s price or
at a discount of up to 20 per cent of that price. Purchases are made from a savings account
from which the employee pays an agreed sum each month. The monthly savings must be
between &pound;5 and &pound;250. Income tax is not chargeable when the option is granted.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>210 Performance and Reward
<p>Impact of share schemes
<p>A study by Oxera (2007) examined the impact of tax-advantaged employee share schemes on
company performance. The key findings were that the tax advantages of such schemes were
not sufficient on their own to increase productivity. Other factors were important: namely,
having non-tax-advantaged schemes, company size (only firms in the upper quartile experi-
enced a statistically significant productivity effect) and being a listed company. In these cir-
cumstances productivity does increase; for example, companies with both tax-advantaged and
non-tax-advantaged schemes achieved increases in productivity of around 5.2 per cent in the
long run.
<p>Gain-sharing
<p>Gain-sharing is a formula-based company or factory-wide bonus plan that provides for
employees to share in the financial gains made by a company as a result of its improved per-
formance. The formula determines the share by reference to a performance indicator such
as added value or some other measure of productivity. In some schemes the formula also
incorporates performance measures relating to quality, customer service, delivery or cost
reduction.
<p>The most popular performance indicator is value added, which is calculated by deducting
expenditure on materials and other purchased services from the income derived from sales of
the product. It is, in effect, the wealth created by the people in the business. A manufacturing
business &lsquo;adds value&rsquo; by the process of production as carried out by the combined contribu-
tion of management and employees.
<p>Gain-sharing differs from profit-sharing in that the latter is based on more than improved
productivity. A number of factors outside the individual employee&rsquo;s control contribute to
profit, such as depreciation procedures, bad debt expenses, taxation and economic changes.
Gain-sharing aims to relate its pay-outs more specifically to productivity and performance
improvements within the control of employees.
<p>Although the financial element is obviously a key feature of gain-sharing, its strength as a
means of improving performance lies equally in its other important features &ndash; ownership,
involvement and communication. The success of a gain-sharing plan depends on creating a
feeling of ownership that first applies to the plan and then extends to the operation. When
implementing gain-sharing, companies enlist the support of employees in order to increase
their commitment to the plan. The involvement aspect of gain-sharing means that informa-
tion generated on the company&rsquo;s results is used as a basis for enabling employees to make sug-
gestions on ways of improving performance, and for giving them scope to make decisions
concerning their implementation.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding for Business Performance 211
<p>However, gain-sharing has never been popular in the UK, perhaps because its use is mainly
limited to the manufacturing sector and it takes time to plan and operate if it is to work well.
Conventional profit-sharing and share ownership schemes are much easier to manage.
<p>Rewarding for business performance: six tips
Produce a case for the scheme; this could be a business case but it could also be &bull;
a case based on the moral obligation of employers to share their prosperity with
employees.
<p>Ensure that you get the maximum benefit in terms of engagement and &bull;
commitment from whatever scheme you adopt.
<p>Ensure that the scheme is given full publicity (as long, of course, as it is paying &bull;
out).
<p>Remember that a scheme may enhance engagement but will not directly &bull;
motivate people.
<p>Make the most of any opportunities the scheme presents to involve employees &bull;
in discussing their contribution to the firm&rsquo;s prosperity.
<p>Consider how a scheme could complement an individual or team bonus plan. &bull;

recognition awards
<p>How to design a scheme &bull;
<p>You will also be able to learn from a number of examples.
<p>Introduction
<p>Recognition schemes acknowledge success. They can form an important part of a total reward
approach, as described in Chapter 3. They complement direct financial rewards and can there-
fore enhance the reward system. As discussed in Chapter 9, recognition schemes are based on
the belief that taking steps to ensure that people&rsquo;s achievements and contribution are recog-
nized is an effective way of motivating them.
<p>Recognition schemes defined
<p>Recognition schemes enable appreciation to be shown to individuals for their achievements
either informally on a day-to day basis or through formal recognition arrangements. They can
take place quietly between managers and individuals in their teams or be visible celebrations
of success.

<p>Recognition Schemes 213
<p>A recognition scheme can be formal and organization wide, providing scope to recognize
achievements by gifts or treats or public applause. Typically, the awards are non-financial but
some organizations provide cash awards. Importantly, recognition is also given less formally
when managers simply say &lsquo;well done&rsquo;, &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; or &lsquo;congratulations&rsquo; face to face or in a brief
note of appreciation.
<p>Benefits of recognition schemes
<p>Recognition schemes can:
<p>enable people&rsquo;s achievements and contributions to be publicly acknowledged and &bull;
provide an effective way of motivating them;
<p>complement and reinforce financial rewards as part of a total reward process; &bull;
<p>increase engagement by demonstrating that the organization values its employees; &bull;
<p>provide rewards for the average performers who are the core contributors in a business &bull;
and may not benefit much if at all from performance pay;
<p>provide ways of rewarding teams as well as individual effort and contribution; &bull;
<p>give line managers the means to provide their people with instant rewards for achieve- &bull;
ment or contribution rather than making them wait until the end of the year for a pos-
sible performance pay increase.
<p>Principles of recognition
<p>The principles that need to be borne in mind when developing recognition schemes are that
recognition:
<p>should be given for specially valued behaviours and exceptional effort as well as for &bull;
special achievements;
<p>should be personalized so that people appreciate that it applies to them; &bull;
<p>needs to be applied equitably, fairly and consistently throughout the organization; &bull;
<p>must be genuine, not used as a mechanistic motivating device; &bull;
<p>should not be given formally as part of a scheme if the achievement has been rewarded &bull;
under another arrangement, for example a bonus scheme;
<p>needs to be given as soon as possible after the achievement; &bull;
<p>should be available to all &ndash; there should be no limits on the numbers who can be recognized; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>214 Performance and Reward
<p>should not be predicated on the belief that such schemes are just about rewarding &bull;
winners;
<p>should be available for teams as well as individuals to reward collective effort; &bull;
<p>should not be based on an over-elaborate scheme. &bull;
<p>It is also necessary to bear in mind that awards above &pound;100 are subject to income tax in the UK.
<p>Types of recognition
Day-to-day recognition
<p>The most effective form of recognition is that provided by managers to their staff on a day-to-
day basis. This is an aspect of good management practice in the same way as getting to know
people, monitoring performance (without being oppressive) and providing positive feedback.
It is provided orally on the spot or in a short note (preferably handwritten) of appreciation,
and should take place soon after the event (not delayed until an annual performance review).
It must be genuine &ndash; people can easily spot insincerity, or someone simply going through the
motions.
<p>This type of recognition should be a natural part of the daily routine. The organization should
aim to develop a recognition culture that is nurtured by the management style of senior man-
agers and permeates the organization through each level of management so that it becomes
&lsquo;the way we do things around here&rsquo;. Managers can be encouraged to adopt this style, but this
should be more by example than by precept, not the subject of a scheme, process or system.
<p>Public recognition
<p>Recognition for particular achievements or continuing effective contributions can be pro-
vided by public &lsquo;applause&rsquo; through an &lsquo;employee of the month scheme&rsquo; or some other
announcement using an intranet, the house journal or notice boards.
<p>Formal recognition
<p>Formal recognition schemes provide individuals (and importantly, through them, their part-
ners) with tangible forms of recognition such as gifts, vouchers, holidays or trips in the UK or
abroad, days or weekends away at hotels or health spas, or meals out. Some schemes also
provide cash awards. Team awards may be through outings, parties and meals. Such schemes
may be centrally driven, with formal award ceremonies. Managers and employees can nomi-
nate individuals for awards. If the awards are substantial, organizations can set up a recogni-
tion committee with employee representatives to agree on who should be eligible, thus
ensuring that decisions are transparent.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Recognition Schemes 215
<p>Formal schemes can provide for different levels of recognition and rewards, as illustrated in
the schedule, shown in Table 14.1, which was developed for a large local authority. This pro-
vides for a graduated series of awards that can be made by managers within a budget. At the
lowest level, managers may be given quite a lot of autonomy to make immediate small recog-
nition awards. The next higher level of rewards would have to be approved by a senior manager
and the highest level would be reviewed by a recognition committee for final approval by top
management.
<p>Table 14.1 Levels of recognition
<p>Level Examples
<p>1: Below &pound;25 Volunteering to help others when the workload is heavy. &bull;
Providing extra help to a customer. &bull;
Working late or at weekends without extra pay to meet an impor- &bull;
tant deadline.
<p>Taking on a temporary extra task that is not part of normal duties. &bull;
Demonstrating valued behaviours. &bull;
<p>2: &pound;25 to &pound;150 Identifying improved work practices. &bull;
Providing a sustained level of customer service. &bull;
Making or recommending cost savings when not part of role. &bull;
Demonstrating valued behaviours that make a significant short- &bull;
term impact.
<p>3: &pound;500 to &pound;1,000 Generating significant extra revenue when not part of role. &bull;
Reducing costs significantly when not part of role. &bull;
Successfully completing a major project that is not part of normal &bull;
role.
<p>Demonstrating valued behaviours that make a significant long- &bull;
term impact.</p>

<p>216 Performance and Reward
<p>Examples of non-cash awards
<p>Some ideas for non-cash awards include:
<p>basket of fruit; &bull;
<p>books; &bull;
<p>bottle of champagne (with a personalized label); &bull;
<p>cinema or theatre vouchers; &bull;
<p>dinner out for two (include a taxi and a babysitter); &bull;
<p>experience days (eg hot air balloon ride, or a day at a health and beauty spa); &bull;
<p>flowers (delivered to the workplace or at home); &bull;
<p>food hamper; &bull;
<p>Fridays off for a month; &bull;
<p>gift certificates; &bull;
<p>jewellery; &bull;
<p>personal letter from the chairman or chief executive; &bull;
<p>plaques or certificates; &bull;
<p>points-based catalogue gifts; &bull;
<p>retail shopping vouchers; &bull;
<p>tickets to a concert, theatre or sports event; &bull;
<p>trip for two to Amsterdam, Barcelona or Paris; &bull;
<p>trophy (passed from one person to another); &bull;
<p>weekend in a hotel for two. &bull;
<p>Designing a recognition scheme
<p>The principles set out earlier in this chapter should be borne in mind when designing and
implementing a recognition scheme. Line managers and employees should be consulted,
guidelines prepared and explained to managers, and the details of the scheme publicized.
<p>The implementation of the scheme should be monitored and steps taken to maintain the
impetus &ndash; managers can lose interest. Progress reports should be made to employees so that
they know that the scheme is working well.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Recognition Schemes 217
<p>Examples of recognition schemes
British Gas
<p>Recognition awards at British Gas are focused more on behaviours than financial results, say,
which should be recognized by the bonus scheme. There are several levels of recognition, none
of which involve cash awards. These are:
<p>everyday recognition from the line manager who says &lsquo;thank you&rsquo;, either by means of a &bull;
personal note or at a team meeting;
<p>site/directorate level; &bull;
<p>British Gas-wide and Centrica-wide recognition. &bull;
<p>It is intended that a minimum of 20 per cent of staff should be recognized by their line manager;
current rates are around 40 per cent. Three-hour workshops are being run to help line manag-
ers understand the benefits of recognition and how to do it.
<p>Camelot
<p>The company believes that it is important to reward staff as near to the event of exceptional
performance as possible, so it has put in place a recognition scheme to provide instant rewards.
Managers and the staff consultative forum were involved in designing the scheme.
<p>The recognition scheme, called Above and Beyond, rewards &lsquo;one off, exceptional, perform-
ance that is not part of the normal job&rsquo;. Managers make their nominations online and they are
approved almost immediately. The employee is then informed and can spend the reward, in
the form of points, straight away. Awards average &pound;50, but range from &pound;10 to &pound;200. The com-
pany&rsquo;s recognition budget is &pound;25 per quarter per employee, so there is an expectation that
most staff will get at least one award each year.
<p>Staff can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; their awards on goods or retail vouchers or add them to their own money to
buy big items such as holidays. Rather than train all the managers, the company used &lsquo;cham-
pions&rsquo; to roll out the scheme. These could be employees at any level, who were trained and
briefed to explain the scheme to everyone else.
<p>Comet
<p>The company distinguishes between &lsquo;recognition&rsquo; and &lsquo;reward&rsquo;. For Comet, recognition is that
part of total reward that is not &lsquo;promised&rsquo; and is also typically non-cash, although some of its
recognition programmes use cash. It recognizes the accomplishment of &lsquo;extra mile&rsquo; perform-
ance rather than everyday behaviour.
<p>The recognition principles are as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>218 Performance and Reward
<p>Our schemes should recognize exceptional behaviours, ultimately building greater &bull;
&lsquo;trust&rsquo; at Comet.
<p>Recognition should drive the individual needs/success criteria of the business area. &bull;
<p>We should provide some corporate direction on recognition to drive consistency, but &bull;
aim to retain the essence of spontaneous, local-led recognition.
<p>Our aim is to have a recognition solution across each business area and at each level &ndash; &bull;
that is, colleague-led, manager-led and company-led.
<p>The reward team oversees all recognition initiatives to ensure branding, consistency &bull;
and the achievement of principles without seeking to control and push responsibility
to line managers.
<p>Recognition is tied to Comet&rsquo;s four key behaviours. An internal company document states:
<p>When you see a demonstration of great individual attitude, care for every detail, deep
knowledge, or a colleague with a passion for service, make sure the behaviours are rec-
ognized. Your recognition initiatives could be linked to encouraging the behaviours and
our core value of being trustworthy. Remember that colleagues living our values of
being trustworthy make a difference to our business.
<p>Glenmorangie
<p>Glenmorangie&rsquo;s scheme is called Heroes, which stands for Honouring Excellence and Reward-
ing Outstanding and Extended Service. It recognizes continuing professional development,
improvement suggestions, long service and &lsquo;making a difference&rsquo; &ndash; going the extra mile to get
the job done. The scheme was developed by a working party consisting of a cross-section of
Glenmorangie employees. There are no cash awards; instead, there are certificates and gifts
chosen from a catalogue, which are presented by the manager at a team meeting.
<p>Lands&rsquo; End
<p>Lands&rsquo; End prefers the term appreciation to recognition, since it thinks the latter suggests
something tangible. It prefers to look for any and every opportunity to demonstrate its real
appreciation of what staff do, and comments that when managers focus on how they can
show their appreciation it improves their own motivation as much as that of the people they
recognize.
<p>London &amp; Quadrant Housing Association
<p>There are two schemes:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Recognition Schemes 219
<p>The Outstanding achiever awards &bull; . These annual awards are designed to recognize and
celebrate exceptional achievements that demonstrate the organization&rsquo;s values. They
are awarded to around 5 per cent of staff, who each receive a lump sum payment worth
2.5 per cent of salary. The process is fairly formal. Anyone with at least one year&rsquo;s
service can be put forward, by a fellow employee, customer or supplier, but the formal
nomination must come from the responsible group director. The group director of
human resources then checks attendance records, since &lsquo;exemplary attendance&rsquo; is
expected from an outstanding achiever. The chief executive considers all the recom-
mendations and decides who is to get the awards.
<p>Our people: individual awards &bull; . Nominations for this scheme can come from fellow
employees, customers and suppliers, and must also be for behaviour that reflects the
values of the organization. This scheme is less formal than the Outstanding achiever
scheme and rewards less exceptional but nonetheless praiseworthy behaviour. Nomi-
nations are considered by the individual&rsquo;s manager, and awards are made to staff who
meet the criteria. These can take the form of chocolates, flowers, vouchers, or a meal or
evening or day out for the family.
<p>Recognition schemes: six tips
Whatever scheme you choose, make sure you can apply it fairly and &bull;
consistently. Apply it to those who really deserve it, and remember to look for a
&lsquo;well done&rsquo; or a &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; for everyone.
<p>For recognition to have any real value it must be genuine. Ensure that it is real, &bull;
spontaneous and appropriate to what someone has done.
<p>Involve everyone in recognition; empower the whole management team to &bull;
recognize people formally, and encourage all colleagues to recognize each other.
<p>Recognizing great behaviour as soon as it happens is the most powerful &bull;
approach. Shout about great achievements and great behaviours.
<p>Public recognition can let others in the business know what has been done, and &bull;
make a colleague feel proud. Award schemes, newsletters and notice boards are
all great ways to publicly recognize achievement. But remember that not
everyone likes public recognition.
<p>A lot of genuine recognition is simple and costs nothing, such as a thank you, a &bull;
letter, or a photo on the wall. But sometimes spending wisely to treat the team
to a meal or a day out can go a long way.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Perhaps the most significant decisions that have to be made by those concerned with reward
management are about levels of pay. In making these decisions it is necessary to be aware of
the various factors that influence pay levels, including the key economic theories that explain
those factors. The practical value of such awareness is that the parts to be played by job evalu-
ation, market rate analysis and trade union negotiations in developing grade and pay struc-
tures, fixing pay levels and relativities and using recruitment premia will be understood and
applied to produce equitable and competitive pay systems.
<p>This chapter summarizes the main theoretical concepts and then deals with the factors influ-
encing job values within organizations. Finally, conclusions are drawn on what these concepts
and factors mean to practitioners.
<p>Determinants of pay
<p>The following theories and concepts provide guidance on the factors that affect pay levels:
<p>the nature of the external and internal labour market; &bull;
<p>classical economic theory (the economic &lsquo;laws&rsquo; of supply and demand); &bull;
<p>the labour theory of value; &bull;
<p>human capital theory; &bull;</p>

<p>Pay Levels 225
<p>efficiency wage theory; &bull;
<p>agency theory; &bull;
<p>the effort bargain. &bull;
<p>The labour market
<p>Markets consist of buyers and sellers of goods. Having too many buyers for a limited number
of goods forces prices up, and a surplus of goods beyond what buyers want forces prices
down. The labour market is a market like any other; it has buyers (employers) and sellers
(employees). The price of labour is the rate of pay required to attract and retain people in
organizations.
<p>The efforts of these buyers and sellers to transact and establish an employment relationship
constitute a labour market. An external market may be local, national or international. It may
be related to specific occupations, sectors or industries in any of these areas. It is within these
markets that the economic determinants of pay levels operate, which include not only supply
and demand factors (see below) but also the impact of inflationary pressures.
<p>In any sizeable organization there is also an internal labour market. This is the market that
exists when firms fill their vacancies from the ranks of existing employees. Pay levels and rela-
tivities in the internal market may differ significantly between firms in spite of general external
market pressures. These arise particularly when long-term relationships are usual, even though
these are becoming less common. Pay in the internal market will be affected by views on the
intrinsic value of jobs and what individuals are worth on the basis of their expertise and con-
tribution, irrespective of the market rate for their job. Pay progression related to length of
service and an &lsquo;annuity&rsquo; approach to pay increments (ie pay which goes up but does not come
down, what economists call &lsquo;the sticky wage&rsquo;) may lead to higher internal rates. But the rela-
tionship between internal and external rates will also depend on policy decisions within the
firm about its levels of pay generally compared with the &lsquo;going rate&rsquo; in the external market.
<p>Classical economic theory
<p>The first theory of wages was advanced by Adam Smith (1776) when he wrote that: &lsquo;The whole
of the advantages and disadvantages of different employments and stock must, in the same
neighborhood, be either perfectly equal or continually tending to equality.&rsquo; He suggested that
workers seek to maximize total utility, not just wages, with total utility (and thus job choice)
being a function of the total net advantage of various jobs. Anticipating the concept of total
rewards by over 200 years, Adam Smith specifically identified several components of total net
advantage besides pay, namely: agreeableness or disagreeableness of work, difficulty and
expense of learning it, job security, responsibility and the possibility of success or failure. A
higher wage or &lsquo;compensating wage differential&rsquo; was required for jobs without some or all of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>226 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>the benefits these conferred. Conversely, jobs with them could be paid less and still offer the
same net advantages as those that pay more but lack the other advantages. Workers seek to
maximize this net advantage or &lsquo;total utility&rsquo;, not just wages.
<p>Later classical and neo-classical theory in the 19th century treated wages as the price of labour
and therefore subject to the laws of supply and demand. This meant adopting the questionable
assumption that all non-pecuniary aspects of jobs are equal. They focused on the external
labour market, which is a market like any other market, as noted at the beginning of this
section. Classical wages theory states that the external labour market has buyers (employers)
and sellers (employees). If the supply of labour exceeds the demand, pay levels go down; if
there is a scarcity of labour and demand exceeds the supply, pay goes up. Pay stabilizes when
demand equals supply at the &lsquo;market clearing&rsquo; or &lsquo;market equilibrium&rsquo; wage. This is some-
times known as the theory of equalizing differences. According to the classical labour econo-
mists, the price of labour is the rate of pay required to attract and retain people in
organizations.
<p>As Elliott (1991) noted: &lsquo;Competitive theory predicts that the forces of supply in the market as
a whole will determine the rates of pay within each firm. The relative pay of any two occupa-
tions in a single firm will be the mirror image of the relative pay of the same two occupations
in the market as a whole.&rsquo;
<p>However, classical economic theory is based on the premises that &lsquo;other things are equal&rsquo; and
that a &lsquo;perfect market&rsquo; for labour exists. In the real world, of course, other things are never
equal and there is no such thing as a universally perfect market: that is, one in which everyone
knows what the going rate is, there is free movement of labour within the market and there are
no monopolistic or other forces interfering with the normal processes of supply and demand.
Imperfections in the market exist because of poor information, lack of opportunity and immo-
bility. They also arise when employers or trade unions exert pressures on pay levels, or when
governments intervene in normal pay determination processes.
<p>Human capital theory as discussed later also explains why individual rates of pay may be influ-
enced by other forces besides supply and demand.
<p>The labour theory of value
<p>In 1865 Karl Marx wrote in Das Kapital that the value of goods and services is determined by
the amount of labour that goes into them. It is not the marketplace that sets prices. Thus the
content of labour determines the price of labour. Mainstream economists have never accepted
this concept, and assert the primacy of supply and demand in the marketplace in setting prices
of goods and services. However, as pointed out by Nielsen (2002), conventional job evaluation
schemes are based on the labour theory of value, in that they are only concerned with job
content and ignore market rate pressures. They make no attempt to price jobs directly.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pay Levels 227
<p>Human capital theory
<p>Levels of pay are influenced by the value of human capital in terms of the skills and expertise
people possess. Workers invest in education and training to increase their value as human
capital and so enhance their future earnings because this will influence their levels of pay. As
explained in more detail by Ehrenberg and Smith (1994) human capital theory: &lsquo;conceptual-
izes workers as embodying a set of skills which can be &lsquo;rented out&rsquo; to employers. The knowl-
edge and skills a worker has &ndash; which comes from education and training, including the training
that experience brings &ndash; generate a certain stock of productive capital.&rsquo;
<p>For the employee, the expected returns on human capital investments are a higher level of
earnings, greater job satisfaction and, at one time but less so now, a belief that security in
employment is assured. For the employer, the return on investment in human capital is
expected to be improvements in performance, productivity, flexibility and the capacity to
innovate that should result from enlarging the skill base and increasing levels of competence.
<p>Efficiency wages theory
<p>Efficiency wages theory proposes that firms will pay more than the market rate because they
believe that high levels of pay will contribute to increases in productivity. This can happen in
two ways: an incentive effect (generating greater effort among current employees) and a
sorting effect (attracting higher-quality employees in the first place). This theory is also known
as &lsquo;the economy of high wages&rsquo;. Organizations are using efficiency wages theory (although
they will not call it that) when they formulate pay policies that place them as market leaders or
at least above the average.
<p>Resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Davis-Blake, 1987) is associated with efficiency wage
theory but focuses on the idea of paying more to attract and retain high-quality employees in
critical positions.
<p>Agency theory
<p>Agency theory, also known as principal agent theory, states that in most firms there is a sepa-
ration between the owners (the principals) and the agents (the managers). Because the princi-
pals may not have complete control over their agents, the latter may act in ways that may not
be in accordance with the wishes of those principals and are not revealed to them. This gener-
ates what economists call agency costs. These consist of the extent to which the amount earned
for the company by the managers as agents to the owners or principals is more than what
might have been earned if the principals had been the managers.
<p>Agency theory as described above can be extended to the concept of the employment relation-
ship, which may be regarded as a contract between a principal (the employer) and an agent </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>228 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>(the employee). The payment aspect of the contract is the method used by the principal to
motivate the agent to perform work to the satisfaction of the employer. But according to this
theory, the problem of ensuring that agents do what they are told remains. It is necessary to
clear up ambiguities by setting targets and monitoring performance to ensure that those objec-
tives are achieved.
<p>Agency theory also indicates that it is desirable to operate a system of incentives to motivate
and reward acceptable behaviour. This process of &lsquo;incentive alignment&rsquo; consists of paying for
measurable results that are deemed to be in the best interests of the owners. Such incentive
systems track outcomes in the shape of quantifiable indices of the firm&rsquo;s performance such as
earnings per share, rather than being concerned with the behaviour that led up to them.
Agency theory is used to justify executive bonuses in accordance with the belief that if incen-
tives schemes are designed properly, top managers will out of self-interest closely monitor per-
formance throughout the organization.
<p>Agency theory was criticized by Bruce et al (2005), who suggested that it cannot be used to
explain executive pay because some researchers adopting an agency theory perspective have
failed to find a strong empirical link between executive pay and firm performance. A riposte
to this from Gomez-Mejia et al (2005) claimed that agency theory does not make any reference
to pay performance sensitivity, and that the failure of this research can be attributable to a
variety of problems with the methodologies used.
<p>The basic proposition of the theory is that the only way in which principals can get loyalty
from their agents is by paying them more. As Perkins and Hendry (2005) comment: &lsquo;Agency
theory takes an essentially negative view of the relationship between principal and agents.&rsquo;
<p>The effort bargain
<p>The concept of the effort bargain is referred to less frequently nowadays but it has its uses as a
further means of describing the employment relationship on pay matters. The concept states
that the task of management is to assess what level and type of inducements it has to offer in
return for the contribution it requires from its workforce.
<p>The aim of workers is to strike a bargain about the relationship between what they regard as a
reasonable contribution and what their employer is prepared to offer to elicit that contribu-
tion. This is termed the &lsquo;effort bargain&rsquo; and is, in effect, an agreement that lays down the
amount of work to be done for a rate of pay or wage rate, not just the hours to be worked.
Explicitly or implicitly, all employees are in a bargaining situation with regard to pay. A system
will not be accepted as effective and workable until it is recognized as fair and equitable by
both parties and unless it is applied consistently.</p>

<p>Pay levels within organizations and the rates of pay for individual jobs are affected by all the
economic factors described earlier in this chapter. There will be policies and practices on the
range or &lsquo;dispersion&rsquo; of pay between different levels, which are affected by an implicit belief in
efficiency wage theory &ndash; that higher rates of pay attract good candidates (the sorting effect),
increase productivity (the incentive effect) and help to retain employees.
<p>The other factors affecting rates of pay are beliefs about the value of the job and the person,
internal relativities, financial considerations (the ability to pay), the influence of trade unions
and the minimum wage.
<p>Value of the job
<p>The intrinsic value of a job is a measure of what a job (not a person) is worth in terms of what
it contributes to achieving the purpose of the organization. An intrinsic value is attached to
jobs because of the impact they make on organizational results and by reference to the levels
of responsibility and skill required to perform them. Increases in impact and these levels lead
to higher rates of pay. This concept is in line with the labour theory of value and provides the
theoretical base for job evaluation. However, as an explanation of the value attached to jobs it
is limited because it ignores external relativities.
<p>Value of the person
<p>Individuals are valued by organizations for three main reasons: 1) the contribution they make
to organizational success, 2) their skills and competences, and 3) the experience they bring to
their jobs. People also have their own value in the market place &ndash; their &lsquo;market worth&rsquo;, which
has to be taken into account by employers in setting their rates of pay.
<p>Internal relativities
<p>It can be argued that the value of anything, including jobs, is always relative to something else,
that is, other jobs. Views on job values within organizations are based on perceptions of the
worth of one job compared with others. This is the concept of internal equity, which is achieved
when people are rewarded appropriately in relation to others according to the value of their
contribution. The case for equal pay for work of equal value is based on the imperative to
achieve internal equity.</p>

<p>Financial circumstances of the organization
<p>&lsquo;Affordability&rsquo; is an important concept in reward management. Pay systems cannot cost more
than the organization can afford, and this will influence the level of pay that can be offered to
employees.
<p>Trade union influence
<p>Pay levels may be determined through collective bargaining with trade unions. They will want
their members&rsquo; pay to keep ahead of inflation, to match market rates and to reflect any increases
in the prosperity of the business. The amount of pressure they can exert on pay levels will
depend on the relative bargaining strengths of the employer and the union.
<p>The minimum wage
<p>Minimum wage legislation in the UK sets minimum rates of pay. The amount is increased
from time to time.
<p>Pay systems
<p>Pay systems within organizations cover the ways in which pay is structured and the methods
used to determine the value of jobs and the relativities between them. They create pay disper-
sion, which is explained by tournament theory, as discussed below.
<p>Pay structures
<p>Within most organizations there are defined or generally understood pay levels for jobs. These
are usually set out in the form of a pay structure, which may cover the whole organization or
groups of related occupations (job families). There may be different structures at various
levels, for example senior management, other staff, manual workers. However, in some mainly
smaller organizations, the pay system is highly flexible and relatively unstructured. It may, for
example, simply consist of individual rates for the various jobs (spot rates) that bear no appar-
ent logical relationship to one another and are determined by management intuitively. Struc-
tures for manual workers may also consist of spot rates that are based on negotiations and
custom and practice.
<p>Pay determination
<p>Where there are formal structures, pay levels and ranges may be determined by the processes
of job evaluation, which assesses the relative internal worth of jobs (internal relativities), and </p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pay Levels 231
<p>market pricing, which assesses external relativities. The type of processes used and the degree
to which they are formal and analytical or informal and intuitive will vary widely. Rates of pay
can also be determined by agreements with trade unions.
<p>Individual rates of pay may be governed by the structure in the form of a fixed rate for the job
or by movement in the form of fixed increments up a scale (a fixed increment is a predeter-
mined addition to an individual&rsquo;s rate of pay that is related to service in the job). These may
take place within a pay bracket with fixed minima and maxima in a graded structure, or by
progression through defined pay ranges in a pay spine (a series of incremental pay points
extending from the lowest to the highest jobs covered by the structure within which pay ranges
for the jobs in the hierarchy are established). Alternatively, pay progression within brackets or
bands or within job-family structures may vary according to individual performance, compe-
tence or contribution.
<p>Pay dispersion
<p>Pay dispersion takes place when the differentials between successive levels in a grade and pay
hierarchy widen progressively. A dispersed pay structure is steeper than average with differen-
tials increasing steadily. A compressed structure is flatter with relatively small differentials.
The term can be used to describe the pay differential between the highest-paid executive and
the lowest-paid worker, although this is usually expressed as a ratio.
<p>Tournament theory
<p>Tournament theory (Lazear and Rosen, 1981) explains the basis of pay dispersion. The tour-
nament model, as its name suggests, describes a process of increasing the motivation of high-
quality staff by offering lucrative &lsquo;prizes&rsquo; (ie pay) for a small number of people who are
promoted to higher-level jobs, with the highest prize of all given to the person who wins the
tournament by getting the top job. Pay growth is larger at higher levels because the scope for
further promotions is lower. The relationship between pay level and organizational level is
therefore convex. The theory indicates that this arrangement will encourage managers to out-
perform other managers and thereby gain the prize of advancing up the pay structure. Winners
stay on to compete again for even larger pay increases. Losers, however, are eliminated from
further competitions and are expected to leave their organization, since their only alternative
is to accept inferior pay and limited career expectations. Thus, according to the theory, dis-
persed pay structures help to retain the star managers in a firm and encourage poor-quality
managers to leave. And people at the highest levels do not need to be worth the amount of the
prize for the scheme to be efficient, because efficiency is a result of the incentive effects that
these larger prizes have on people lower down in the hierarchy. Resource dependence theory,
as mentioned earlier, focuses on the level of pay required to attract and retain staff in critical
positions rather than the differentials between those at the higher levels.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>232 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Research on management pay hierarchies by Conyon et al (2001), using data on 500 executives
from the top three levels of 100 UK firms, found not only the predicted convex relationship
between executive pay and organizational level but also that higher chief executive differen-
tials were associated with larger numbers of executives in the levels just below the top. For each
added executive in the next two levels below the chief executive, the difference between the lat-
ter&rsquo;s pay and that of the rest of the executive team increased by 3.5 per cent.
<p>Other research has questioned some of the claimed beneficial effects of the tournament model.
The results of a study by Bloom (1999) indicated that greater dispersion in pay within an
organization is associated with lower individual and group performance, at least where work
interdependencies are important. Research by Bloom and Michel (2002) established that
organizations with greater dispersion in their pay structures had managers with lower tenures
and higher probabilities of turnover.
<p>Factors affecting pay levels
<p>The factors affecting individual pay levels are summarized in Figure 15.1.
<p>An example of a policy on pay levels is provided by Aegon UK where the reward system is
designed to recognize three core factors that affect the level of pay individuals should receive
for their &lsquo;personal commitment and consistent contribution within their roles&rsquo;. These are:
<p>Internal job value: the bigger the job, the higher the reward. &bull;
<p>External job value: the level of reward will be influenced by external market rates and &bull;
the degree to which market forces affect the salaries required to attract and retain
quality staff.

<p>Value of the person: individual employees may be rewarded at a higher level because &bull;
they are making a greater contribution, are performing better, meeting objectives and
have achieved a higher level of skill or competence than their colleagues (measured
through the performance management process).
<p>As an internal policy statement explains: &lsquo;Whilst the first two factors are the primary respon-
sibility of the compensation and benefits in group personnel, line managers are best placed to
manage the third factor for all staff within their reporting teams.&rsquo;
<p>Pay level theory: six significant points for practitioners
Labour market theory explains how pay levels are determined in external and &bull;
internal labour markets.
<p>Classical economic theory focuses attention on external pressures and the &bull;
perceived need for &lsquo;competitive pay&rsquo;: pay that matches or exceeds market rates.
It can be used as a justification for &lsquo;market&rsquo; pricing rather than job evaluation,
concentrating on external competitiveness at the expense of internal equity.
<p>Human capital theory encourages a &lsquo;pay for the person&rsquo; approach involving &bull;
contribution or competency-related pay. It also underpins the concept of
individual market worth. This indicates that individuals have their own value in
the market place, which they acquire and increase through investments by their
employer and themselves in gaining extra skills and expertise through training,
development and experience.
<p>Efficiency wages theory can be used to justify paying more than the market rate &bull;
because it is believed that high levels of pay will contribute to increases in
productivity.
<p>Agency theory can be used to justify a policy of incentives related to firm &bull;
performance, including share ownership, which will align the interests of
managers with those of the shareholders.
<p>Tournament theory can provide a justification for widening pay differentials &bull;
progressively up the hierarchy.

<p>Introduction
<p>Decisions about what jobs are worth take place all the time. The decisions may be made infor-
mally, based on assumptions about the value of a job in the market place or by comparison
with other jobs in the organization. Or there may be a formal approach, either some type of
job evaluation or &lsquo;levelling&rsquo;, as described in this chapter, or a systematic comparison with
market rates. It has been stated by Gupta and Jenkins (1991) that the basic premise of job eval-
uation is that certain jobs &lsquo;contribute more to organizational effectiveness and success than
others, are worth more than others and should be paid more than others&rsquo;.
<p>Evaluating &lsquo;worth&rsquo; leads directly or indirectly to where a job is placed in a level or grade within
a hierarchy and can therefore determine how much someone is paid. The performance of
individuals also affects their pay, but this is not a matter for job evaluation, which is concerned
with valuing the jobs people carry out, not how well they perform their jobs.
<p>This chapter contains a definition of job evaluation and a description of the different types of
analytical and non-analytical formal schemes and the processes of market pricing and level-
ling. This is followed by a description of job and role analysis techniques as these provide the
factual basis for all formal evaluations. Finally, consideration is given to the use of computers
as an aid to evaluation.
<p>The purposes of job evaluation
<p>Job evaluation is a systematic process for defining the relative worth or size of jobs within an
organization in order to establish internal relativities. As described by Armstrong and Cummins
(2008) there are three purposes of job evaluation:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 237
<p>to generate the information required to develop and maintain an internally equitable &bull;
grade and pay structure, by establishing the relative value of roles or jobs within the
organization (internal relativities) based on fair, sound and consistent judgements;
<p>to provide the data required to ensure that pay levels in the organization are externally &bull;
competitive, by making valid market comparisons with jobs or roles of equivalent
complexity and size;
<p>to ensure transparency so that the basis upon which grades are defined, jobs graded &bull;
and rates of pay determined is clear to all concerned.
<p>The first aim was elaborated on by The Equal Opportunities Commission in its Good Practice
Guide on Job Evaluation Schemes Free of Sex Bias (2003) where it was stated that: &lsquo;Non-dis-
criminatory job evaluation should lead to a payment system which is transparent and within
which work of equal value receives equal pay regardless of sex.&rsquo;
<p>Achieving the purposes
<p>Approaches to achieving these purposes can either use a formal analytical or non-analytical
job evaluation scheme or value jobs informally. In the former case the basis of the job evalua-
tion is a detailed analysis of the job or role, which leads to the production of a job description
or role profile. Informal evaluation is based on assumptions about what the job contains but
may possibly refer to an existing job description that is probably inaccurate and out of date.
<p>Formal job evaluation
<p>Formal approaches use standardized methods to evaluate jobs, which can be analytical or non-
analytical. Such schemes deal with internal relativities and the associated process of establish-
ing and defining job grades or levels in an organization. Schemes may be used to evaluate all
jobs or they may focus on &lsquo;benchmark&rsquo; jobs that are typical of the different occupations and
levels of work in an organization that are used as points of reference with which other jobs can
be compared and evaluated.
<p>An alternative approach is &lsquo;extreme market pricing&rsquo;, in which formal pay structures and indi-
vidual rates of pay are entirely based on systematically collected and analysed information on
market rates and no use is made of job evaluation to establish internal relativities. Extreme
market pricing should be distinguished from the process of collecting and analysing market
rate data used to establish external relativities after internal relativities have been determined
through formal job evaluation.
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s formal job evaluation fell into disrepute because it was alleged to be
bureaucratic, time consuming and irrelevant in a market economy where market rates dictate </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>238 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>internal rates of pay and relativities. However, job evaluation is still practised widely (60 per
cent of the respondents to the 2007 e-reward job evaluation survey had a formal scheme) and,
indeed, its use is increasing, not least because of the pressures to achieve equal pay. Although
formal job evaluation may work systematically it should not be treated as a rigid, monolithic
and bureaucratic system. It should instead be regarded as an approach that may be applied
flexibly. Process &ndash; the way job evaluation is used &ndash; can be more important than the system
itself when it comes to producing reliable and valid results.
<p>Informal job evaluation
<p>Informal approaches price jobs either on the basis of assumptions about internal and external
relativities or simply by reference to going or market rates when recruiting people unsup-
ported by any systematic analysis. There are, however, degrees of informality. A semi-formal
approach might require some firm evidence to support a market pricing decision, and the use
of role profiles to provide greater accuracy to the matching process.
<p>Analytical job evaluation schemes
<p>Analytical job evaluation is based on a methodology of breaking whole jobs down into a
number of defined elements or factors such as responsibility, decisions and the knowledge and
skill required. These are assumed to be present in all the jobs to be evaluated. In point-factor
and fully analytical matching schemes, jobs are then compared factor by factor, either with a
graduated scale of points attached to a set of factors or with grade or role profiles analysed
under the same factor headings.
<p>The advantages of an analytical approach are that, first, evaluators have to consider each of the
characteristics of the job separately before forming a conclusion about its relative value, and
second, they are provided with defined yardsticks or guidelines that help to increase the objec-
tivity and consistency of judgements. It can also provide a defence in the UK against an equal
pay claim. The main analytical schemes as described below are point-factor rating, analytical
matching and factor comparison.
<p>Point-factor rating
<p>Point-factor schemes are the most common forms of analytical job evaluation. They were used
by 70 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward 2007 job evaluation survey who had job
evaluation schemes. The basic methodology is to break down jobs into factors. These are the
elements in a job such as the level of responsibility, knowledge and skill or decision making
that represent the demands made by the job on job holders. For job evaluation purposes it is
assumed that each of the factors will contribute to the value of the job and is an aspect of all </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 239
<p>the jobs to be evaluated, but to different degrees. The 2007 e-reward job evaluation survey
established that the respondents&rsquo; schemes had between 3 and 14 factors, the average number
being five.
<p>Each factor is divided into a hierarchy of levels, typically five or six. Definitions of these levels
are produced to provide guidance on deciding the degree to which the factor applies in the job
to be evaluated. A maximum points score is allocated to each factor. The scores available may
vary between different factors in accordance with beliefs about their relative significance. This
is termed explicit weighting. If the number of levels varies between factors this means that they
are implicitly weighted, because the range of scores available will be greater in the factors with
more levels.
<p>The total score for a factor is divided between the levels to produce the numerical factor scale.
Progression may be arithmetic, eg 50, 100, 150, 200, or geometric, eg 40, 90, 150, 220. In the
latter case, more scope is given to recognize senior jobs with higher scores.
<p>The complete scheme consists of the factor and level definitions and the scoring system (the
total score available for each factor and distributed to the factor levels). This comprises the
&lsquo;factor plan&rsquo;.
<p>Jobs are &lsquo;scored&rsquo; (ie allocated points) under each factor heading on the basis of the level of the
factor in the job. This is done by comparing the features of the job with regard to that factor
with the factor level definitions to find out which definition provides the best fit. The separate
factor scores are then added together to give a total score that indicates the relative value for
each job and can be used to place the jobs in rank order.
<p>Evaluators, often formed into a panel consisting of management and staff representatives,
have to interpret the definitions when comparing them with the job. But there are limits to the
precision with which levels can be defined and the extent to which information about the job
indicates which level is appropriate. Judgement is therefore required in making a &lsquo;best fit&rsquo;
decision and this is why point-factor evaluation, like any other form of valuing jobs, can never
be wholly objective.
<p>The members of a job evaluation panel often disagree initially about an evaluation and con-
sensus may only be obtained after a prolonged discussion. The role of the panel facilitator is
crucial in obtaining agreement without too many compromises. However, as evaluators
become more experienced, possibly during the development and testing phases of a scheme,
they become more skilled at interpreting the factor plan and the job information. They estab-
lish &lsquo;conventions&rsquo; that, on the basis of past decisions and precedents, expand and clarify the
meaning of level definitions and indicate how the information about a job can be interpreted
in order to make a judgement.
<p>A weighted factor plan is illustrated in Figure 16.1. In this example, the evaluations are aster-
isked and the total score would be 450 points. Examples of factor level definitions are given in
Figure 16.2.</p>

<p>Analytical job matching
<p>Like point-factor job evaluation, analytical job matching is based on the analysis of a number
of defined factors. There are two forms of analytical matching. One matches role profile to
grade/level profile; the other matches role profile to benchmark role profile.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 241
<p>Role-to-grade analytical matching
<p>Profiles of roles to be evaluated that have been analysed and described in terms of a number of
job evaluation factors are compared with grade, band or level profiles that have been analysed
and described in terms of the same job evaluation factors. The role profiles are then &lsquo;matched&rsquo;
with the range of grade or level profiles to establish the best fit and thus grade the job.
<p>Role-to-role analytical matching
<p>Role profiles for jobs to be evaluated, analysed and described in terms of a number of job eval-
uation factors are matched analytically with benchmark role profiles that have been defined
under the same factor headings. A benchmark job is one that has already been graded as a
result of an initial job evaluation exercise. It is a typical job that represents the different occu-
pations and levels of work in an organization and is used as a point of reference with which
other jobs can be compared and evaluated. If there is a good fit between a role to be evaluated
and a benchmark role that has already been graded, then the role being evaluated will be
placed in that grade. Generic role profiles, that is those covering a number of like roles, will be
used for any class or cluster of roles with essentially the same range of responsibilities, such as
team leaders or personal assistants. Role-to-role matching may be combined with role-to-
grade matching.
<p>Use of analytical matching
<p>Analytical matching can be used to grade jobs or place them in levels following the initial eval-
uation of a sufficiently large sample of benchmark jobs: representative jobs that can provide a
valid basis for comparisons. This can happen in big organizations when it is believed that it is
not necessary to go through the whole process of point-factor evaluation for every job, espe-
cially where &lsquo;generic&rsquo; roles are concerned. When this follows a large job evaluation exercise
such as in the NHS, the factors used in analytical matching may be the same as those in the
point-factor job evaluation scheme that underpins the analytical matching process and can be
invoked to deal with difficult cases or appeals. In some matching schemes the number of
factors may be simplified; for example, the HERA scheme for higher education institutions
clusters related factors together, reducing the number of factors from seven to four.
<p>However, analytical matching may not necessarily be underpinned by a point-factor evalua-
tion scheme, and this can save a lot of time in the design stage as well as when rolling out the
scheme.</p>

<p>Factor comparison
<p>The original factor comparison method compared jobs factor by factor, using a scale of money
values to provide a direct indication of the rate for the job. It was developed in the United
States but is not used in the UK. The Hay Guide Chart Profile method (a &lsquo;proprietary brand&rsquo;
of job evaluation) is described by the Hay Group as a factor comparison scheme but, apart
from this, the only form of factor comparison now in use is graduated factor comparison,
which compares jobs factor by factor with a graduated scale. The scale may have only three
value levels &ndash; for example lower, equal, higher &ndash; and no factor scores are used. This is a method
often used by the independent experts engaged by employment tribunals to advise on an equal
pay claim. Their job is simply to compare one job with one or two others, not to review inter-
nal relativities over the whole spectrum of jobs in order to produce a rank order.

<p>Any of the schemes referred to above can be &lsquo;tailor-made&rsquo; or &lsquo;home-grown&rsquo; in the sense that
they are developed specifically by or for an organization, a group of organizations or a sector,
such as further education establishments. The 2007 e-reward survey showed that only 20 per
cent of the schemes were tailor-made. A number of management consultants offer their own
&lsquo;ready-made&rsquo; schemes or &lsquo;proprietary brands&rsquo;. Consultants&rsquo; schemes tend to be analytical
(point-factor, factor comparison or matching) and may be linked to a market rate database.
They often provide for computer aid. As many as 60 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward
survey used these schemes.
<p>Hybrid schemes are consultants&rsquo; schemes that have been modified to fit the particular needs
of an organization; 20 per cent of the e-reward respondents had such schemes. Typically, the
modification consists of amendments to the factor plan or, in the case of Hay, to the Hay
Guide Chart.
<p>Non-analytical schemes
<p>Non-analytical job evaluation schemes enable whole jobs to be compared in order to place
them in a grade or a rank order &ndash; they are not analysed by reference to their elements or
factors. They can stand alone or be used to help in the development of an analytical scheme.
For example, the paired comparison technique described later can produce a rank order of
jobs that can be used to test the outcomes of an evaluation using an analytical scheme. It is
therefore helpful to know how non-analytical schemes function even if they are not used as the
main scheme.
<p>Non-analytical schemes can operate on a job-to-job basis in which one job is compared with
another to decide whether it should be valued more, or less, or the same (ranking and &lsquo;internal </p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 243
<p>benchmarking&rsquo; processes). Alternatively, they may function on a job-to-grade basis in which
judgements are made by comparing a whole job with a defined hierarchy of job grades (job
classification) &ndash; this involves matching a job description to a grade description. They are dis-
tinguished from analytical matching schemes, which are based on the analysis and compari-
son of jobs on a factor-by-factor basis rather than the &lsquo;whole-job&rsquo; comparisons used in
non-analytical schemes. The e-reward 2007 survey showed that only 14 per cent of respond-
ents&rsquo; schemes were non-analytical.
<p>Non-analytical schemes are relatively simple but rely on more subjective judgements than
analytical schemes. Such judgements will not be guided by a factor plan and do not take
account of the complexity of jobs. There is a danger therefore of leaping to conclusions
about job values based on a priori assumptions that could be prejudiced. For this reason,
non-analytical schemes do not provide a defence in a UK equal pay case.
<p>There are four main types of non-analytical schemes: job classification, job ranking, paired
comparison (a statistical version of ranking) and internal benchmarking.
<p>Job classification
<p>This approach is based on a definition of the number and characteristics of the levels or
grades in a grade and pay structure into which jobs will be placed. The grade definitions may
refer to such job characteristics as skill, decision making and responsibility but these are not
analysed separately. Evaluation takes place by a process of non-analytical matching or &lsquo;job
slotting&rsquo;. This involves comparing a &lsquo;whole&rsquo; job description (ie one not analysed into
factors), with the grade definitions to establish the grade with which the job most closely
corresponds. The difference between job classification and role-to-grade analytical match-
ing as described above is that in the latter case the grade profiles are defined analytically, that
is in terms of job evaluation factors, and analytically defined role profiles are matched with
them factor by factor. However, the distinction between analytical and non-analytical
matching can be blurred when the comparison is made between formal job descriptions or
role profiles that have been prepared in a standard format that includes common headings
for such aspects of jobs as levels of responsibility or knowledge and skill requirements. These
&lsquo;factors&rsquo; may not be compared specifically but will be taken into account when forming a
judgement. But this may not satisfy the UK legal requirement that a scheme must be ana-
lytical to provide a defence in an equal pay claim.
<p>Job ranking
<p>Whole-job ranking is the most primitive form of job evaluation. The process involves com-
paring whole jobs with one another and arranging them in order of their perceived value to
the organization. In a sense, all evaluation schemes are ranking exercises because they place
jobs in a hierarchy. The difference between simple ranking and analytical methods such as </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>244 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>point-factor rating is that job ranking does not attempt to quantify judgements. Instead, whole
jobs are compared &ndash; they are not broken down into factors or elements although, explicitly or
implicitly, the comparison may be based on some generalized concept such as the level of
responsibility. Job ranking or paired comparison ranking as described below is sometimes
used as a check on the rank order obtained by point-factor rating.
<p>Paired comparison ranking
<p>Paired comparison ranking is a statistical technique that is used to provide a more sophisti-
cated method of whole-job ranking. It is based on the assumption that it is always easier to
compare one job with another than to consider a number of jobs and attempt to build up a
rank order by multiple comparisons.
<p>The technique requires the comparison of each job as a whole separately with every other job.
If a job is considered to be of a higher value than the one with which it is being compared, it
receives two points; if it is thought to be equally important, it receives one point; if it is regarded
as less important, no points are awarded. The scores are added for each job and a rank order
is obtained.
<p>Paired comparisons can be done factor by factor and in this case can be classified as analytical.
A simplified example of a paired comparison ranking is shown in Figure 16.3.
<p>The advantage of paired comparison ranking over normal ranking is that it is easier to compare
one job with another rather than having to make multi-comparisons. But it cannot overcome
the fundamental objections to any form of whole-job ranking &ndash; that no defined standards for
judging relative worth are provided and it is not an acceptable method of assessing equal value
or comparable worth. There is also a limit to the number of jobs that can be compared using
this method &ndash; to evaluate 50 jobs requires 1,225 comparisons. Paired comparisons are occa-
sionally used analytically to compare jobs on a factor-by-factor basis.

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 245
<p>Internal benchmarking
<p>Internal benchmarking means comparing the job under review with any internal job that is
believed to be properly graded and paid (a benchmark job) and placing the job under consid-
eration into the same grade as that job. It is what people often do intuitively when they are
deciding on the value of jobs, although it is not usually dignified in job evaluation circles as a
formal method of job evaluation. The comparison is made on a whole-job basis without ana-
lysing the jobs factor by factor. It can be classified as a formal method if there are specific pro-
cedures for preparing and setting out role profiles and for comparing profiles for the role to be
evaluated with standard benchmark role profiles.
<p>Market pricing
<p>Market pricing is the process of obtaining information on market rates (market rate analysis)
to inform decisions on pay structures and individual rates of pay. It is called &lsquo;extreme market
pricing&rsquo; when market rates are the sole means of deciding on internal rates of pay and rela-
tivities, and conventional job evaluation is not used. An organization that adopts this method
is said to be &lsquo;market driven&rsquo;. Techniques of collecting and analysing market rate data are
described in Chapter 18. This approach has been widely adopted in the United States. It is
associated with a belief that &lsquo;the market rules, OK&rsquo;, disillusionment with what was regarded as
bureaucratic job evaluation, and the enthusiasm for broad-banded pay structures (structures
with a limited number of grades or bands, as described in Chapter 19). It is a method that
often has appeal at board level because of the focus on the need to compete in the market place
for talent.
<p>Market rate analysis, as distinct from extreme market pricing, may be associated with formal
job evaluation. The latter establishes internal relativities and the grade structure, and market
pricing is used to develop the pay structure &ndash; the pay ranges attached to grades. Information
on market rates may lead to the introduction of market supplements for individual jobs or
the creation of separate pay structures (market groups) to cater for particular market rate
pressures.
<p>The acceptability of either form of market pricing is dependent on the availability of robust
market data (not always easy) and, when looking at external rates, the quality of the job-to-
job matching process (ie comparing like with like). It can therefore vary from analysis of
data by job titles to detailed matched analysis collected through bespoke surveys focused on
real market equivalence. Extreme market pricing can provide guidance on internal relativi-
ties even if these are market driven. But it can lead to pay discrimination against women
where the market has traditionally been discriminatory and it does not satisfy UK equal pay
legislation. To avoid a successful equal pay claim in the UK, any difference in pay between
men and women carrying out work of equal value based on market rate considerations has </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>246 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>to be &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;; in other words, the employment tribunal will need to be con-
vinced that this was not simply a matter of opinion and that adequate evidence from a
number of sources was available. In such cases, the tribunal will also require proof that there
is a business case for the market premium to the effect that the recruitment and retention of
essential people for the organization was difficult because pay levels were uncompetitive.
<p>Levelling
<p>Levelling is an approach to job evaluation that focuses on defining the levels of work in an
organization and fitting jobs into those levels. The levels may be defined in terms of one factor
such as decision making. It may serve as the basis for a pay structure but, increasingly, levelling
contributes to organizational analysis, provides guidance on career mapping and the develop-
ment and description of international organization structures, and acts as a link to an infor-
mation technology system such as PeopleSoft or SAP.
<p>The levelling concept
<p>The concept of defining levels of work was a feature of the work of Elliott Jaques (1956) on the
measurement of responsibility. His research at Glacier Metal led to the conclusion that: &lsquo;It
appeared as though there existed in people&rsquo;s minds a pattern of rates expected for levels of
work done, and that this pattern was made manifest by stating level of work in maximum
time-span terms.&rsquo; This was his concept of the time span of discretion, which he defined as &lsquo;The
maximum period of time that would elapse under the particular conditions of review, during
which the member was authorized and expected to exercise discretion on his own account to
discharge the responsibilities allocated to him&rsquo;. He proposed that levels of work should be
defined in terms of time span. This had some appeal as seemingly providing a single significant
criterion for measuring responsibility, but it has not been widely adopted because of measure-
ment difficulties, especially at higher levels. One example of a firm using time span as the main
criterion is Nationwide, as illustrated in Figure 16.4.
<p>An alternative criterion for defining levels of work, called the decision band method (DBM),
was evolved by Paterson (1974). He observed that there are six levels or bands of decision
making in organizations. They range from simple defined decisions &lsquo;made within the limits
of a prescribed operation&rsquo;, to corporate policy-making decisions that &lsquo;determine the scope,
direction and goal of the whole enterprise&rsquo;. These definitions are used as the basis for assign-
ing jobs to levels. The DBM method was adopted extensively in Africa but did not take hold
in the UK.
<p>A later approach that acknowledged the influence of Jaques but not Paterson was developed at
Unilever. As described by Dive (2004) the notion of broad-banding was rejected and a &lsquo;work
level&rsquo; structure was introduced. The process was called &lsquo;the decision-making accountability</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 247
<p>This level contains those roles in which decision making
extends over a few days or weeks and the work is fairly well
patterned, involving people working individually.

cannot always be speci�ed in advance. Decision making

<p>Decision making tends to involve tasks with a time span of

with strategic direction and turning corporate strategies into
action. The decision making would tend to involve tasks with

<p>solution set&rsquo; (DMA). There are eight work levels, each defined in terms of seven separate ele-
ments, namely: expected work, resources, problem solving, change, lateral teams, environ-
ment and task horizon. As Dive explained, DMA &lsquo;concentrates on the added value of decisions
taken&rsquo;. Its key premise is that: &lsquo;Job holders must take decisions that cannot be taken at a lower
level and which need not be taken at a higher level.&rsquo; He emphasized that using DMA is a way
of developing a healthy organization. It is not just a method of grading jobs.
<p>Applications of levelling
<p>When it is used simply as a means of defining pay structures, &lsquo;levelling&rsquo; could be regarded as
no more than another name for job evaluation. But it is more meaningful when the focus is on
the organizational, career mapping and IT applications mentioned above. Defining an organ-
ization structure in levels may express the philosophy of a business about how it should be
organized and the career steps that are available to its people.
<p>In practice, levelling uses established job evaluation techniques such as analytical matching
or job classification and may be underpinned by point-factor rating. It makes a decision on
the number of levels required, which could be based on a ranking exercise using either
point-factor scheme scores or whole-job ranking. Alternatively, an a priori decision may be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>248 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>made on the number of levels needed by a study of the organization structure, which may
be supported by a role profiling exercise. This decision may be amended later after the level
structure has been tested.
<p>Levels may be defined in terms of job evaluation factors or a selection of them. Sometimes
only a single descriptor is used. In cases where the focus is on career mapping as well as or
instead of pay determination, the level definitions or profiles may be defined in ways that
clearly establish the career ladder, often in a job family (ie a group of jobs in which the nature
of the work will be similar but it is carried out at different levels). The definition may express
what people are expected to know and be able to do at each level (technical competencies) and
may refer to behavioural competencies. The aim is to produce a clear hierarchy of levels that
will ease the process of allocating roles to levels and define career progression steps in and
between families.
<p>Job analysis for job evaluation
<p>The reliability and validity of job evaluation depends largely on the quality of the analysis of
jobs that provides the factual information in the form of job descriptions upon which the eval-
uation is based.
<p>Existing job descriptions are seldom any use for job evaluation because they are generally
limited simply to listing tasks or duties and do not cover the demands made on people in their
roles. Further analysis is almost always necessary and there is a choice of methods as described
below, namely: written questionnaires, structured interviews or computer-aided interviews.
When developing a scheme, it may be worth trialling more than one method.
<p>Written questionnaires
<p>Embarking on a complete re-write of the organization&rsquo;s job descriptions could be a formida-
ble and time-consuming task. Instead a questionnaire may be used, with a commitment to
review the design of job descriptions or role profiles on completion of the job evaluation
project, using the information drawn from the questionnaires.
<p>Questionnaires ask for narrative responses to questions that relate to each factor in the scheme.
They may be given to employees for completion on the basis that they know best how the job
is done, or to the line manager, or, ideally, to both as a shared task.
<p>Structured interviews
<p>Alternatively, questionnaires can be used as the basis for a structured interview with job
holders &ndash; either directly sharing the questionnaire with the job holders, or using an interview </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 249
<p>guide based on the questionnaire, administered by job analysts. The results of the interview
are then written up in full after the interview. Sharing a questionnaire with job holders can
increase the transparency of the process if it is given to job holders either before or during the
interview.
<p>Computer-aided analysis
<p>Interactive computer-aided systems, as described later, use a set of online questions. The
answers are converted into a job profile.
<p>Job descriptions
<p>The job descriptions resulting from the analysis contain information about the job&rsquo;s place in
the organization structure followed by a definition of its overall purpose, a list of key result
areas and an analysis of the job demands in terms of each of the factors in the scheme. An
example is given in Figure 16.5.
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation uses computer software to convert information about jobs
into a job evaluation score or grade. It is generally underpinned by a conventional point-factor
scheme. The &lsquo;proprietary brands&rsquo; offered by consultants are often computer-aided. Comput-
ers may be used simply to maintain a database that records evaluations and their rationale. In
the design stage they can provide guidance on weighting factors through multiple regression
analysis, although this technique has been largely discredited and is little used now.
<p>Methodology
<p>The software used in a fully computer-aided scheme essentially replicates in digital form the
thought processes followed by evaluators when conducting a &lsquo;manual&rsquo; evaluation. It is based
on defined evaluation decision rules built into the system shell. The software typically provides
a facility for consistency checks by, for example, highlighting scoring differences between the
job being evaluated and other benchmark jobs.
<p>The two types of computer-aided evaluation are:
<p>Schemes in which the job analysis data is either entered direct into the computer or &bull;
transferred to it from a paper questionnaire. The computer software applies pre-
determined rules to convert the data into scores for each factor and produce a total
score. This is the most common approach.</p>

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 251
<p>Interactive computer-aided schemes in which the job holder and his or her manager sit &bull;
in front of a PC and are presented with a series of logically interrelated questions, the
answers to which lead to a score for each of the built in factors in turn and a total
score.
<p>The case for computer-aided job evaluation
<p>A computer-aided scheme can achieve greater consistency than when a panel of evaluators
uses a paper scheme. With the help of the computer the same input information gives the
same output result, which is not always the case with a panel. It can also increase the speed of
evaluations, reduce the resources required and provide facilities for sorting, analysing, report-
ing on the input information and system outputs, and record keeping (database).
<p>The case against computer-aided job evaluation
<p>For some organizations the full approach is too expensive and elaborate a process. Others do
not want to abandon the involvement of employees and their representatives in the traditional
panel approach. There is also the problem of transparency in some applications. This is some-
times called &lsquo;the black box effect&rsquo; &ndash; those concerned have difficulty in understanding the logic
that converts the input information to a factor level score. Interactive systems such as those
offered by Pilat Consultants (Gauge) and Watson Wyatt aim to overcome this difficulty.
<p>It is perhaps for these reasons that fewer than half the respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey
had computer-aided schemes, and over half of those used computers simply to maintain job
evaluation records.
<p>Choice of approach
<p>The fundamental choice is between using formal or informal methods of valuing jobs. This
may not be a conscious decision. A company may use informal methods simply because that&rsquo;s
what it has always done and because it never occurs to its management that there is an alterna-
tive. But it may decide deliberately that an informal or semi-formal approach fits its circum-
stances best.
<p>If it is decided that a formal or semi-formal approach is required, the advantages and disad-
vantages of each approach as summarized in Table 16.1 need to be considered, examined in
the light of criteria for choice (such as those set out below) and compared with the objectives
of the scheme and the context in which it will be used.</p>

<p>254 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Criteria for choice
<p>The following are the criteria to be used in making a choice:
<p>Thorough in analysis and capable of impartial application: the scheme should have &bull;
been carefully constructed to ensure that its methodology is sound and appropriate in
terms of all the jobs it has to cater for. It should also have been tested and trialled to
check that it can be applied impartially to those jobs.
<p>Appropriate: it should cater for the particular demands made on all the jobs to be &bull;
covered by the scheme.
<p>Comprehensive: the scheme should be applicable to all the jobs in the organization &bull;
covering all categories of staff, and if factors are used they should be common to all
those jobs. There should therefore be a single scheme that can be used to assess rela-
tivities across different occupations or job families and to enable benchmarking to take
place as required.
<p>Transparent: the processes used in the scheme from the initial role analysis through to &bull;
the grading decision should be clear to all concerned. If computers are used, informa-
tion should not be perceived as being processed in a &lsquo;black box&rsquo;.
<p>Non-discriminatory: the scheme should meet requirements relating to equal pay for &bull;
work of equal value.
<p>Ease of administration: the scheme should not be too complex or time consuming to &bull;
design or implement.
<p>The decision may be to use one approach, for example point-factor rating or analytical match-
ing. But an increasing number of organizations are combining the two: using point-factor
rating to evaluate a representative sample of bench mark jobs (ie jobs that can be used as
points of comparison for other jobs) and, to save time and trouble, evaluating the remaining
jobs by means of analytical matching.
<p>Making the choice
<p>The overwhelming preference for analytical schemes shown by the e-reward 2007 survey sug-
gests that the choice is fairly obvious. The advantages of using a recognized analytical approach
that satisfies equal value requirements appear to be overwhelming. Point-factor schemes were
used by 70 per cent of the respondents and others used analytical matching, often in conjunc-
tion with the points scheme.
<p>There is much to be said for adopting point-factor methodology as the main scheme but using
analytical matching in a supporting role to deal with large numbers of generic roles not covered
in the original benchmarking exercise. Analytical matching can be used to allocate generic </p>

<p>roles to grades as part of the normal job evaluation procedure to avoid having to resort to job
evaluation in every case. The tendency in many organizations is to assign to job evaluation a
supporting role of this nature rather than allowing it to dominate all grading decisions and
thus involve the expenditure of much time and energy.
<p>Developing a point-factor job evaluation scheme
<p>Point-factor job evaluation schemes as described on page 238 are the most popular type of
scheme. The sequence of activities required to develop one is shown in Figure 16.6.
<p>Step 1: Set up the project
Establish project team
<p>It is highly desirable to set up a project team to oversee and take part in the project. The team
should include representatives of line management and staff. Technical support can be pro-
vided by HR, possibly with the help of outside consultants. The support will include the
detailed work of job analysis and developing and testing factor plans.

<p>256 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Draw up project plan
<p>A project plan should be prepared in as much detail as possible. This will provide the basis for
managing the project. A plan set out as a bar chart is illustrated in Figure 16.7.
<p>Formulate communications strategy
<p>Job evaluation schemes can arouse intense suspicion, even fear. It is essential to have a strategy
for communicating information about the scheme to allay these suspicions and fears. The
strategy should be developed in consultation with the project team, who may well be involved
in the communication process. The strategy should cover what should be communicated, who
it should be communicated to and how it should be communicated. A checklist of the major
points that might be included in the communications strategy is set out in Figure 16.8.
<p>Step 2: Design factor plan
<p>A factor plan is a matrix consisting of a number of factors (a factor is a criterion for judging the
value of a job in one particular aspect or characteristic of the work involved), which are divided
into a number of scored levels that can be used to determine the extent to which the factor is
present in a job. The process of developing a basic factor plan involves the following steps:
<p>1. Identify and define factors.
<p>2. Decide on the number of levels for each factor and define them.
<p>3. Decide on the scoring system to be used.

<p>4. Decide whether or not to have explicit weighting (this takes place when some factors are
regarded as more important and are therefore allocated a higher range of points scores
than others).
<p>Select and define factors
<p>A factor is a criterion for judging the value of a job in one particular aspect or characteristic of
the work involved. The 2007 e-reward job evaluation survey established that the respondents&rsquo;
schemes had between 3 and 14 factors, the average number being five. Guidelines on the selec-
tion of factors are given in Table 16.2, and guidelines on defining factor levels are given in
Table 16.3.
<p>Decide on scoring system
<p>The next step is to decide on the scoring system. Each level in the factor plan has to be allo-
cated a points value so that there is a scoring progression from the lowest to the highest level.
A decision needs to be made on how to set the scoring progression within each factor.
<p>There are two methods. First, the arithmetic or linear approach assumes that there are consistent
step differences between factor levels &ndash; for example, a five-level factor might be scored 10, 20, 30,
40 and 50. Alternatively, geometric scoring assumes that there are larger score differences at each </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>258 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Table 16.2 Guidelines for selecting factors
<p>1. The factors must be capable of identifying relevant and important differences between
jobs that will support the creation of a rank order of the jobs to be covered by the
scheme.
<p>2. The factors should between them measure all significant job features and should be of
broadly comparable scope.
<p>3. The factors should reflect the values of the organization.
<p>4. They should apply equally well to different types of work, including specialists and gen-
eralists, lower-level and higher-level jobs, and not be biased in favour of one gender or
group.
<p>5. The whole range of jobs to be evaluated at all levels should be covered without favouring
men or women, people belonging to a particular racial group, different age groups or
any particular job or occupation.
<p>6. The scheme should fairly measure features of female-dominated jobs as well as male-
dominated ones.
<p>7. The choice should not lead to discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, disability,
religion, age or any other reason. Experience should not be included as a factor because
it could be discriminatory either on the grounds of gender or age. The same principle
applies to education or qualifications as stand-alone factors.
<p>8. Job features frequently found in jobs carried out mainly by one gender should not be
omitted, for example, manual dexterity, interpersonal skills and &lsquo;caring&rsquo; responsibili-
ties. However, if such features are included, it is important that the scheme captures the
range of skills across all jobs, including those that might be dominated by another
gender.
<p>9. Double counting should be avoided; in other words, each factor must be independent
of every other factor &ndash; the more factors (or sub-factors) in the plan, the higher the prob-
ability that double counting will take place.
<p>10. Elision or compression of more than one significant job feature under a single factor
heading should be avoided. If important factors are compressed with others, it means
that they could be undervalued.
<p>11. The factor definitions should be clear, relevant and understandable, and written in a
way that is meaningful to those who will use the scheme.
<p>12. The factors should be acceptable to those who will be covered by the scheme.</p>

<p>Job Evaluation Schemes 259
<p>Table 16.3 Guidelines on defining factor levels
<p>1. Consider the number of levels (often four, five, six or seven) that may be needed to
reflect the range of responsibilities and demands in the jobs covered by the scheme.
<p>2. Analyse what would characterize the highest or lowest level for each factor and how
these should be described.
<p>3. Decide provisionally on the number of levels (say three) between the highest and lowest
level so that the level structure reflects the graduation in responsibilities or demands.
(This decision could be amended following the process of defining levels, which might
reveal that more or fewer levels are required.)
<p>4. Define each level as clearly as possible to help evaluators make &lsquo;best fit&rsquo; decisions when
they compare role data with level definitions.
<p>5. Ensure that the levels should cover the whole range of demands in this factor that are
likely to arise in the jobs with which the evaluation scheme is concerned.
<p>6. Relate the content of level definitions to the definition of the factor concerned and
ensure that it does not overlap with other factors.
<p>7. Ensure that the factor levels represent clear and recognizable steps in demand.
<p>8. Provide for uniform progression in the definitions level by level from the lowest to the
highest level. There should be no gaps or undefined intermediate levels that might lead
to evaluators finding it difficult to be confident about the allocation of a level of
demand.
<p>9. Define levels in absolute, not relative terms. So far as possible any dimensions should be
defined. They should not rely upon a succession of undefined comparatives, eg small,
medium, large.
<p>10. Ensure that each level definition stands on its own. Level definitions should not be
defined by reference to a lower or higher level; in other words, it is insufficient to define
a level in words to the effect that it is a higher (or lower) version of an adjacent level.
<p>successive level in the hierarchy to reflect progressive increases in responsibility. Thus the levels
may be scored 10, 20, 35, 55 and 80. This increases the scoring differentiation between higher-
level jobs. The e-reward 2007 job evaluation survey found that 73 per cent of respondents used
the geometric model in their schemes. An example of a geometrically scored outline unweighted
factor plan is given in Table 16.4.</p>

<p>Decide whether or not to weight the factors
<p>Weighting recognizes that there are differences in the importance of factors by allocating more
or less points to them. The choice is first between weighting or not weighting factors. Only 19
per cent of the schemes of the e-reward 2007 survey respondents were unweighted. This
reflects the view of the majority of people that some factors must be more important than
others.
<p>The most common but highly judgemental approach to decide on weighting is for the project
team to discuss and agree subjective views on which factors are more important and arbitrar-
ily allocate additional points or extra levels to them. A typical method of deciding on explicit
weighting (ie extra points) is to get each member of the team to distribute 100 points amongst
the factors; these are then revealed to the whole team, which reaches an agreement on the most
acceptable distribution. This discussion may be expected to take account of guiding principles
such as that no factor will have a weighting of less than 5 per cent or more than 30 per cent.
<p>It is common practice to defer the final weighting decision until the unweighted factor plan
has been tested. This test may reveal whether or not weighting is required.
<p>The factor plan should not discriminate on the grounds of gender, race or disability. Guide-
lines on the factors to be considered are given in Chapter 17, Table 17.1.
<p>Step 3: Test factor plan and decide on computerization
<p>To test the factor plan it is necessary first to select, analyse and describe a representative sample
of test jobs and then to evaluate the jobs, using the draft factor plan that may have been scored
but is not yet weighted if it has been decided to defer a weighting decision. The aim of the test
is to check on the extent to which:

<p>Following the test, the factor plan can be revised and a decision on weighting made. This will

introducing computer-aided evaluation. (The two types of computer evaluation are described
in the section on Methodology, page 249.)
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of computer-aided evaluation are set out in Table 16.5.

<p>262 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Identify, analyse and evaluate benchmark jobs
<p>The final paper or computer-aided scheme is used to evaluate benchmark jobs. These are
typical jobs that represent the different occupations and levels of work in an organization and
are used as points of reference with which other jobs can be compared and evaluated. The
evaluated benchmark jobs provide the basis for designing a grade structure and are used in
analytical matching as described below. They will include the test jobs but it may be necessary
to select additional ones to provide a sufficient number for designing a grade structure.
<p>Design grade structure
<p>The information on the benchmark job evaluation can be used to design a grade structure as
described in the next section of this chapter. Grades may be defined in terms of a range of
points scores. Additionally the grades may be defined descriptively in the form of grade pro-
files as a basis for using analytical matching to speed up the processes of grading the remaining
jobs and of maintaining the grading system by grading or regrading new or changed jobs after
the initial exercise.
<p>Develop analytical matching process
<p>Analytical matching involves matching jobs to be evaluated on a factor-by-factor basis either
with analytical grade definitions (grade profiles) or analytical job descriptions for benchmark
posts (role profiles). It will be necessary to ensure that the grade profiles are defined in terms
of the job evaluation factors. It will also be necessary to define a protocol for analytical match-
ing that specifies:
<p>what constitutes a perfect match, ie where all the elements in the role profile match all &bull;
the elements in the grade or benchmark role profile;
<p>the number of matches of individual elements required to indicate that a profile match &bull;
is justified, for example 6 out of 10; however, it is usual to restrict the mismatches
allowed to fairly small variations &ndash; if there are any large ones, the match would be
invalidated;
<p>any elements that must match for there to be a profile match (for example it may be &bull;
decided that there must be a match for an element covering knowledge and skills);
<p>the procedure for grading if there has been a mismatch (this may specify a full evalua- &bull;
tion of the role if the matching process is using the point-factor analytical scheme).
<p>Define operating procedures
<p>These will cover how jobs should be analysed and evaluated, including who is responsible, the
basis upon which requests for re-evaluation can be made and the appeals procedure. The pro-</p>

grounds of gender, race or disability. Guidelines on avoiding discrimination are given in
Chapter 17, Table 17.1.

<p>Introduction
<p>In 1970 the difference between the earnings of men and women in the UK (the gender pay
gap) was 37.9 per cent. Pay inequality between men and women in the UK is not so blatant
now since the 1970 Equal Pay Act, the efforts of the Equal Opportunities Commission (now
the Equality and Human Rights Commission) and a proliferation of reports &ndash; the 2001
Kingsmill Review of Women&rsquo;s Employment and Pay, the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research (NIESR) (2001), the Task Force on Equal Pay (2001) and the Women and

<p>Equal Pay 265
<p>Work Commission (2006). But in spite of all this effort there is still a significant gender gap.
The government&rsquo;s 2008 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ONS, 2008) revealed that the
gap between the hourly earnings for full-time men and women was 17.1 per cent. This was the
same as in 2005. So no recent progress has been made in reducing it, although it has declined
a little from 21.2 per cent in 1998. One of the reasons for this slight narrowing of the gap has
been the national minimum wage, which helped part-time women who had formerly been
paid an hourly rate that was below that of their full-time male comparators.
<p>As Robert Elliott (1991) commented: &lsquo;Discrimination arises when equals are treated une-
qually.&rsquo; Historically, it has been generally accepted by men in a man&rsquo;s world that women&rsquo;s
place was in the home, unless they were needed to carry out menial and therefore underpaid
jobs. Women&rsquo;s work has been undervalued because of the low rates of pay. It has been a
vicious circle. Prior to the Equal Pay Act, collective agreements tended to have only one rate of
pay for women workers, with no differentiation between grades of work or levels of skill.
<p>The entry of women into the professions in the 19th century and pressures for women&rsquo;s rights
in the 20th heralded a very gradual change in this climate of discrimination. But it needed the
Treaty of Rome (1957), Article 179 of which enshrined the principle of equal pay for equal
work, to stimulate anti-discriminatory law in the United Kingdom. The first British legislation
was the Equal Pay Act of 1970, amended by the Equal Pay Amendment Regulations in 1983.
<p>The persistence of the gender pay gap in spite of this legislation is wrong in principle but also
damaging in practice. As Denise Kingsmill wrote in her 2001 Review of Women&rsquo;s Employment
and Pay:
<p>I am convinced that the scale and persistence of the gender pay gap in Britain reflects a
failure in human capital management that is neither good for the economy nor in the
interests of the majority of employers or employees. The need to address issues of
women&rsquo;s employment and pay is not just a matter of creating a society in which men
and women have equal opportunities and are equally valued for the contribution they
make, important though these are. It is also a matter of making the best use of the full
range of human capital to promote economic growth.
<p>Any steps to tackle this problem must be based on an understanding of the causes of pay dis-
crimination and these are analysed in the first section of this chapter. The major, but not
hugely successful, instrument for dealing with it in the UK has been the UK legislation on
equal pay, which is described in the second section of the chapter. The final sections cover the
steps that can be taken to achieve equality, manage the risks of successful equal pay claims and
defend claims.</p>

<p>266 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Reasons for unequal pay
<p>In an analysis of the economics of equal pay for work of equal value, Rubery (1992) sug-
gested that the undervaluation of women&rsquo;s employment is caused by three interrelated
factors: 1) gender discrimination in the ways in which jobs are graded and paid, 2) wide-
spread occupational segregation by gender, and 3) differences in the labour supply and
labour market conditions that allow the differences to be perpetuated. A further reason was
given in the report of the Equal Pay Task Force (2001), namely, the unequal impact of
women&rsquo;s family responsibilities.
<p>Comprehensive research conducted by the NIESR (2001) into the causes of the gender pay gap
identified the following five key factors:
<p>Human capital differences: differences in educational levels and work experience. His- &bull;
torical differences in the levels of qualifications held by men and women have contrib-
uted to the pay gap. Women are still more likely than men to have breaks from paid
work to care for children and other dependents. These breaks impact on women&rsquo;s level
of work experience, which in turn impacts on their pay rates.
<p>Part-time working: the pay gap between women&rsquo;s part-time hourly earnings and men&rsquo;s &bull;
full-time hourly earnings is particularly large and, because so many women work part
time, this is a major contributor to the gender pay gap. Some of this gap is due to part-
time workers having lower levels of qualifications and less work experience. However,
it is also due to part-time work being concentrated in less well-paid occupations.
<p>Occupational segregation: women&rsquo;s work is highly concentrated in certain occupations &bull;
(60 per cent of working women work in just 10 occupations). And the occupations that
are female-dominated are often the lowest paid. In addition, women are still underrep-
resented in the higher-paid jobs within occupations &ndash; the &lsquo;glass ceiling&rsquo; effect.
<p>Workplace segregation: at the level of individual workplaces, high concentrations of &bull;
female employees are associated with relatively low rates of pay. And higher levels of
part-time working are associated with lower rates of pay, even after other factors have
been taken into account.
<p>Travel patterns: on average women spend less time commuting than men. This may be &bull;
because of time constraints due to balancing work and caring responsibilities. This can
impact on women&rsquo;s work in two ways: a smaller range of jobs to choose from and/or
lots of women wanting work in the same location (ie near to or where they live), which
leads to lower wages for these jobs.
<p>Other factors that affect the gender pay gap include: job grading practices, appraisal systems,
reward systems, retention measures, career breaks, poor union representation and wage setting
practices. In the latter case, wage levels set entirely on the basis of external comparisons (market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 267
<p>rates) can lead to unequal pay for women within the organization simply because external
rates reflect the pay inequities already existing in the labour market.
<p>The design and operation of pay structures can contribute to maintaining or even enlarging
the pay gap. For example, experienced men with skills that, because of unequal opportunities,
women do not have to the same extent, may be started at higher rates of pay within a pay range
for the job. It is said that men are better at negotiating higher rates of pay for themselves,
although there is no supporting evidence for this.
<p>Extended pay ranges, especially where progression is based on length of service, will favour
men, who are much less likely than women to have career breaks and may therefore progress
further and faster. The assimilation of men on their present higher rates of pay in the upper
reaches of new pay ranges may leave women behind and they may take a long time to catch
up, if they ever do. Broad-banded pay structures, as described in Chapter 19, can also lead
to discrimination.
<p>It is noteworthy that none of the key factors identified by the NIESR research refers specifically
to pay inequities as a cause of the gender pay gap. Indeed, Diana Kingsmill (2001) commented
that: &lsquo;Unlawful wage inequality &ndash; the occurrence of unequal pay&hellip; does not appear to be as
commonplace as the 18 per cent headline gap would suggest.&rsquo; This opinion seems to be backed
up in part by the 2001 report of the Equal Pay Task Force, which stated that in their view, pay
discrimination contributed to 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the pay gap &ndash; a wide range that
seems to be matter of opinion rather than evidence.
<p>The Kingsmill Review focused mainly on the other factors creating the pay gap and Diana
Kingsmill commented that: &lsquo;Time and time again I have been confronted with data demonstrat-
ing that women are clustered towards the bottom of organizational hierarchies while men are
clustered towards the top. This distribution clearly has a profound impact on the pay gap.&rsquo;
<p>The pay gap may have decreased slightly in recent years but it is still unacceptable. However,
dealing with it is difficult. The equal pay legislation described below has had some effect, but
it cannot deal with reasons for the pay gap that are not associated with unequal base rates of
pay, such as part-time working, occupational segregation, workplace segregation or career
breaks resulting in gaps in pay progression and starting rates for women.
<p>These are complex issues and they are more difficult to cope with than relatively straightfor-
ward unequal base rates for like work. Increases in the National Minimum Wage have helped
but are not enough. It will take radical changes in the ways that women are employed and their
pay is managed (pay on starting a job or following promotion, and pay progression) to make
a real difference. That will take time and a lot of effort that will not be forthcoming voluntarily
in many organizations. But this does not detract from the need to deal with pay inequities. The
next section of this chapter therefore concentrates on the equal pay legislation and how it
affects pay policy and practice.</p>

<p>268 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>The equal pay legal framework
<p>The equal pay for work of equal value legal framework is based on the provisions of European
legislation, the 1970 Equal Pay Act as amended by the Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations
1983, and case law. The legislation essentially provides that pay differences are allowable only
if the reason for them is not related to the sex of the job holder. The Act and its amendment
are implemented through employment tribunals. The Employment Act 2002 provided for the
use of equal pay questionnaires.
<p>The same principles of fairness and equity of course apply to other potential areas of dis-
crimination, and although the rest of this chapter focuses on the equal pay legislation and
its impact, it is also concerned with the conduct of equal pay reviews designed to identify
any aspects of discrimination related to race, religion, disability or age that results in pay
inequities.
<p>European legislation
<p>Article 119 of the EC founding Treaty of Rome of 1957 (now subsumed and expanded as
Article 142 of the Treaty of Maastricht) stated that men and women should receive equal pay
for equal work &ndash; in order to establish what is often described as a &lsquo;level playing field&rsquo; in terms
of wages. Article 119 was extended by the Equal Pay Directive of 1975, which stated that:
<p>Men and women should receive equal pay for work of equal value. &bull;
<p>Job classification systems (which is Euro-English for any formal grading systems and &bull;
thus encompasses job evaluation schemes) should be fair and non-discriminatory.
<p>EC member states should take steps to implement the equal pay principle. &bull;
<p>The Equal Pay Act 1970
<p>The 1970 Equal Pay Act effectively outlawed separate women&rsquo;s rates of pay by introducing an
implied equality clause into all contracts of employment. Under the Act, which came into
force in 1975, an employee in the United Kingdom is entitled to claim pay equal to that of an
employee of the opposite sex in the same employing organization in only two situations:
<p>where they are doing the same, or broadly similar work (often termed &lsquo;like work&rsquo;); &bull;
<p>where the work they do is rated equivalent under a job evaluation scheme. &bull;
<p>The basis of the Act is that every contract of employment is deemed to contain an equality
clause that is triggered in either situation. The equality clause modifies any terms in a woman&rsquo;s
contract that are less favourable than those of the male comparator. Thus, if a woman is paid
less than a man doing the same work, she is entitled to be upgraded to the same rate of pay.
Although the Act refers to pay, it extends to all aspects of the employee benefits package.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 269
<p>The three important points to note about the original Act are that:
<p>Because it was confined to like work and work rated as equivalent, the scope of com- &bull;
parison was fairly narrow.
<p>It did not make job evaluation compulsory, but did establish the important point (or &bull;
made the important assumption) that where job evaluation did exist and valued two
jobs equally, there was a prima facie entitlement to equal pay.
<p>It recognized that a job evaluation scheme could be discriminatory if it set &lsquo;different &bull;
values for men and women on the same demand under any heading&rsquo;. It gave effort, skill
and decision as examples of headings.
<p>However, the European Commission&rsquo;s Equal Pay Directive of 1975 stated that the principle
of equal pay should be applied to work of equal value. The Commission successfully argued
before the European Court of Justice in 1982 that the United Kingdom had failed to imple-
ment the directive, because the Equal Pay Act enabled individuals to obtain equal pay for
work of equal value only where their employer had implemented job evaluation. As a result
the United Kingdom government had to introduce the 1983 Equal Pay (Amendment) Regu-
lations of the Act, which came into force in 1984. These are often referred to as the equal
value regulations.
<p>The Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations 1983
<p>Under this equal value amendment women are entitled to the same pay as men (and vice
versa) where the work is of equal value &lsquo;in terms of the demands made on a worker under
various headings, for instance, effort, skill, decision&rsquo;.
<p>This removed the barrier built into the Act that had prevented women claiming equal pay
where they were employed in women&rsquo;s jobs and no men were employed in the same work.
Now any woman could claim equal pay with any man and vice versa, subject to the rules about
being in the same employment. Equal value claims can be brought even if there are no job
evaluation arrangements, although the existence of a non-discriminatory and analytical job
evaluation scheme that has been applied properly to indicate that the jobs in question are not
of equal value can be a defence in an equal value case.
<p>The amendment also provided for the assignment of &lsquo;independent experts&rsquo; by employment
tribunals to assess equality of value between claimant and comparator under such headings as
effort, skill and decision without regard to the cost or the industrial relations consequences of
a successful claim.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>270 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Employment Act 2002
<p>One of the biggest barriers to bringing equal pay claims has been a lack of access to informa-
tion regarding other people&rsquo;s pay. The Equal Pay (Questions and Replies) Order 2003 of the
Employment Act 2002 provided for an Equal Pay questionnaire that can be used by an
employee to request information from their employer about whether their remuneration is
equal to that of named colleagues. Unions may also lodge these forms on behalf of their
members.
<p>The questionnaire includes:
<p>A statement of why the individual (the complainant) thinks they are not receiving &bull;
equal pay, followed by a statement of who they believe the comparators are. A compa-
rator is the person the complainant is comparing themselves with. Complainants can
compare themselves with a predecessor or successor in the job. The comparator must
be in the same employment as the complainant.
<p>Factual questions to ascertain whether the complainant is receiving less pay than the &bull;
comparator and, if so, the reason why.
<p>A question asking whether the employer (the respondent) agrees or disagrees (with &bull;
reasons) that the complainant is being paid less than the comparator.
<p>A question asking whether the employer agrees or disagrees (with reasons) that the &bull;
complainant and the comparator are doing equal work.
<p>Space for the complainant&rsquo;s own questions. &bull;
<p>The employer is asked to respond within eight weeks but is not required to reply to the com-
plainant&rsquo;s questions. However, if the employer fails without reasonable excuse to reply within
eight weeks or replies in &lsquo;an evasive or ambiguous way&rsquo;, the Employment Tribunal may con-
clude that a respondent did not provide a proper explanation for a difference in pay because
there was no genuine reason for the difference.
<p>The Gender Equality Duty 2007
<p>The Gender Equality Duty places a legal responsibility on public authorities in England, Scot-
land and Wales to promote gender equality, eliminate sex discrimination and demonstrate
that they treat men and women fairly.
<p>Case law
<p>The following are some of the leading cases that provide guidance in a number of areas as indi-
cated on how the equal pay legislation should be applied in a number of areas.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 271
<p>The basis of comparison
<p>In the case of Hayward v. Cammell Laird (1988) the House of Lords ruled that the Act required
a comparison of each term of the contract considered in isolation. The applicant was therefore
entitled to the same rates of basic and overtime pay as the comparator even though the other
terms of her contract were more favourable.
<p>The definition of pay
<p>In Barber v. Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance Group (1990) the European Court of Justice
held that occupational pensions under a contracted-out pensions scheme constitute &lsquo;pay&rsquo;
under Article 119 and so must be offered to men and women on equal terms.
<p>Extended pay scales
<p>In Crossley v. ACAS (1999) the applicant claimed that she was doing work of equal value to the
comparator but earned significantly less due to the fact that the ACAS pay scales required
many years experience to reach the top of the pay band. This, it was argued, discriminated
against women, who are more likely to have shorter periods of service. Although the Tribunal
accepted that there was a period during which the job was being learnt, it agreed the period in
this case was too long.
<p>In Cadman v. the Health and Safety Executive (2006) The European Court ruled that pay could be
related to service but might have to be objectively justified by demonstrating that longer service
results in skills necessary to do a higher job. This means that employers can be challenged by
women if the latter can provide evidence that longer service does not lead to better performance.
<p>Market forces
<p>In Enderby v. Frenchay Health Authority (1993) the European Court of Justice ruled that &lsquo;the
state of the employment market, which may lead an employer to increase the pay of a particu-
lar job in order to attract candidates, may constitute an objectively justified ground&rsquo; for a dif-
ference in pay. But tribunals will want clear evidence that a market forces material factor
defence is based on &lsquo;objectively justified grounds&rsquo;, bearing in mind that the labour market
generally discriminates against women. They may view with suspicion evidence gleaned only
from published surveys that they may hold to be inherently discriminatory because they simply
represent the status quo.
<p>Red-circling
<p>In Snoxell v. Vauxhall Motors Ltd (1977) it was held that if an employee&rsquo;s pay is not reduced,
ie is &lsquo;protected&rsquo;, following a re-grading exercise when their pay falls above the maximum for
their new grade (red-circling), the protection should not last indefinitely.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>272 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Transparency
<p>In what is usually referred to in abbreviated form as the &lsquo;Danfoss&rsquo; case, the European Court of
Justice in 1989 ruled that:
<p>The Equal Pay Directive must be interpreted as meaning that when an undertaking
applies a pay system which is characterized by a total lack of transparency, the burden
of proof is on the employer to show that his [sic] pay practice is not discriminating
where a female worker has established, by comparison with a relatively large number of
employees, that the average pay of female workers is lower than that of male workers.
<p>Use of job evaluation as a defence in an equal pay claim
<p>In Bromley v. Quick (1988) the Court of Appeal ruled that a job evaluation system can provide
a defence only if it is analytical in nature. The employer must demonstrate the absence of sex
bias in the job evaluation scheme, and jobs will be held to be covered by a job evaluation
scheme only if they have been fully evaluated using the scheme&rsquo;s factors.
<p>Code of Practice on Equal Pay
<p>This code was produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission in 2003. It is not legally
binding but employment tribunals may take into account an employer&rsquo;s failure to act on its
provisions.
<p>Equal pay claims
<p>Claims for equal pay, which may be supported by a completed equal pay questionnaire, can be
made to an employment tribunal on any of the following three grounds:
<p>where the work is like work, meaning the same or very similar work; &bull;
<p>where the work is rated as equivalent under a job evaluation &lsquo;study&rsquo;; &bull;
<p>where the work is of equal value &lsquo;in terms of the demands made on a worker under &bull;
various headings, for instance, effort, skill, decision&rsquo;.
<p>The person making the claim &ndash; the applicant &ndash; must find a comparator who is a person of the
opposite gender doing like, equivalent or equal value work who is paid more or has more ben-
eficial terms and conditions of employment than the applicant.
<p>If a tribunal finds that the work is like, equivalent or of equal value it can invoke the equality
clause in the legislation and rule that the man and the woman should be paid the same.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Equal Pay 273
<p>Achieving equal pay
<p>The achievement of equal pay is a matter of eliminating discrimination or bias in fixing rates
of pay. Bear in mind that discrimination can occur on grounds of race, disability, age, sexual
orientation or religious belief as well as between men and women.
<p>The following actions are required to ensure that equal pay is achieved:
<p>Use an analytical job evaluation scheme that is free of bias (see Table 17.1). &bull;
<p>Ensure that discrimination or bias does not occur in operating the job evaluation &bull;
scheme (see Table 17.1).
<p>Design a grade and pay structure that is free of bias. This will cover such issues as dis- &bull;
crimination in placing grade boundaries in the structure and over-extended pay scales
(see Table 17.1).
<p>Ensure that the processes used for grading jobs in the structure are free of bias. &bull;
<p>Check the policy and practice on positioning employees within a pay range in a graded &bull;
pay structure or on a pay point in a pay spine to ensure that bias does not occur (for
example, if men are consistently placed at a higher point in the scale than women on
appointment or promotion without justification in terms of qualifications or experi-
ence, or women returning from maternity leave are not re-entering their pay scale at
the position they would have attained had they not been on leave).
<p>Check the policy and practice on assimilating staff into a new grade and pay structure &bull;
to ensure that one category of staff is not favoured over another.
<p>Check the policy and practice on progressing the pay of staff within a pay structure to &bull;
ensure that no category of staff is progressing faster up a grade or to higher points in a
grade without good reason.
<p>Review policy and practice on upgradings and promotions to ensure that discrimina- &bull;
tion is not taking place, for example between white and Asian employees.
<p>Conduct an equal pay review to establish the extent to which there is inequality in rates &bull;
of pay for work of equal value (eg part-time female workers paid less pro rata than full-
time male workers carrying out like work or work of equal value) and identify the causes
of the inequality, and take action as necessary to deal with any problem (see below).
<p>Ensure that line managers are aware of their responsibility for avoiding pay discrimination. &bull;
<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (2009) in its guidance notes on equal pay also
recommended that there should be only one pay system, which should be transparent and
simple and that any change in the system should be evaluated to ensure that it will not be
discriminatory.</p>

<p>Areas for avoiding bias
<p>Design of the analytical job
evaluation scheme
<p>Operating the job evalua-
tion scheme
<p>Design of grade and pay structure
<p>The factors should not be biased in &bull;
favour of one gender or group.
<p>The whole range of jobs to be &bull;
evaluated at all levels should be
covered without favouring men or
women, people belonging to a
particular racial group, different
age groups or any particular job or
occupation.
<p>The scheme should fairly measure &bull;
features of female-dominated jobs
as well as male-dominated jobs.
<p>Experience should not be included &bull;
as a factor because it could be
discriminatory either on the
grounds of gender or age. The same
principle applies to education or
qualifications as stand-alone
factors.
<p>Job features frequently found in &bull;
jobs carried out mainly by one
gender should not be omitted: for
example, manual dexterity,
interpersonal skills and &lsquo;caring&rsquo;
responsibilities.
<p>Double counting should be &bull;
avoided, ie each factor must be
independent of every other factor
&ndash; the more factors (or sub-factors)
in the plan, the higher the
probability that double counting
will take place.
<p>Elision or compression of more &bull;
than one significant job feature
under a single factor heading
should be avoided. If important
factors are compressed with others,
it means that they could be
undervalued.
<p>The factor definitions should be &bull;
clear, relevant and understandable,
and written in a way that is
meaningful to those who will use
the scheme.
<p>The scheme should be &bull;
transparent; everyone
concerned should know
how it works (the basis
upon which the evaluations
are produced).
<p>Appropriate proportions of &bull;
women, those from ethnic
minorities and people with
disabilities should be
involved in the process of
applying job evaluation.
<p>The quality of role analysis &bull;
should be monitored to
ensure that analyses
produce accurate and
relevant information that
will inform the job
evaluation process and will
not be biased.
<p>Consistency checks should &bull;
be built into operating
procedures.
<p>The outcomes of evalua- &bull;
tions should be examined to
ensure that gender or any
other form of bias has not
occurred.
<p>Particular care is necessary &bull;
to ensure that the outcomes
of job evaluation do not
simply replicate the existing
hierarchy &ndash; it is to be
expected that a job
evaluation exercise will
challenge present
relativities.
<p>All those involved in role &bull;
analysis and job evaluation
should be thoroughly
trained in the operation of
the scheme and in how to
avoid bias.
<p>Grade boundaries should not be &bull;
placed between jobs that have been
evaluated as virtually indistinguish-
able, bearing in mind that the problem
will be most acute if grade boundaries
are placed between traditionally male
and female jobs.
<p>&lsquo;Read-across&rsquo; mechanisms should exist &bull;
between different job families and
occupational groups if they are not all
covered by the same plan.
<p>Market rate comparisons should be &bull;
treated with caution to ensure that
differentials arising from market
forces can be objectively justified.
<p>Male and female employees, those &bull;
who are disabled or those from
different ethnic groups should not be
disadvantaged by the methods used to
adjust their pay following regrading.
<p>A non-discriminatory analytical job &bull;
evaluation system should be used to
define grade boundaries and grade
jobs.
<p>Discriminatory job descriptions &bull;
should not be used as a basis for
designing and managing the structure.
<p>Women&rsquo;s or men&rsquo;s jobs should not &bull;
cluster respectively at the higher and
lower levels in the grade of the
hierarchy.
<p>Any variation between pay levels for &bull;
men and women in similarly evaluated
jobs (for example for market rate
reasons) should be objectively
justified.
<p>Red-circling should be free of sex bias. &bull;
Objectively justifiable reasons should &bull;
exist for any inconsistency in the
relation of the grading of jobs in the
structure to job evaluation results.</p>

<p>Equal Pay 275
<p>Risk assessment
<p>Some organizations in low-risk situations may be convinced that they are doing enough about
ensuring equal pay without introducing job evaluation. Others have decided that because their
business imperatives are pressing they are prepared to accept a measure of risk in their policy
on equal pay. Some, regrettably, may not care. But if there is medium or high risk then action
needs to be taken to minimize it. Successful equal pay claims can be hugely expensive, espe-
cially in UK public sector organizations with powerful and active trade unions. Equal pay risk
management may therefore involve using a non-discriminatory job evaluation scheme and
following the prescriptions for achieving equal pay set out above.
<p>The 2007 e-reward survey of job evaluation established that only 52 per cent of respondents
had an analytical job evaluation scheme. The 2009 CIPD reward survey found that 52 per cent
of respondents have already carried out or are planning an equal pay review. The remaining
48 per cent have not, nor do they have plans to do so. There are variations by sector, with
manufacturing firms more resistant to reviews (60 per cent) and public sector organizations
least resistant (20 per cent). A review had been completed by 2008 by 49 per cent of the public
sector organizations and only 14 per cent of the manufacturing firms.
<p>Clearly many organizations have decided that the risk of a claim is negligible. However, it is
unwise simply to assume that there is little or no risk and it is advisable to carry out a risk
assessment so that the organization is aware of the scale of the risk, if any. It can then decide
whether or not to take steps to minimize the risk, such as introducing an analytical job evalu-
ation scheme.
<p>The best way to make this assessment is to carry out a formal equal pay review as described
below. If an organization is unwilling or unable to take this step, it should at least carry out an
analysis of the pay of men and women carrying out like work to identify the existence and
cause of any unjustified differences.
<p>Assessing the risk of a claim also means considering the possibility of individuals initiating
action on their own or trade unions taking action on behalf of their members. Individual
actions may come out of the blue but the person may have raised an equal pay grievance for-
mally or informally, and line managers should understand that they must report this immedi-
ately to HR or senior management. A clear indication of trouble brewing in the UK is when an
employee under the Employment Act 2002 submits an Equal Pay questionnaire to request
information about whether his or her remuneration is equal to that of colleagues. Although
trade unions are most likely to lodge questionnaires on behalf of their members, individuals
can still do so independently by obtaining advice from the EOC (available on their website).
The likelihood of trade union action will clearly be higher when there is a strong union with
high penetration in the organization, which is often the case in the public sector. But any
union member can seek help from her or his union. Even if the union is not recognized for
negotiating purposes it can still provide support.</p>
<br>

<p>276 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Equal pay review
<p>The purpose of an equal pay review is to:
<p>establish whether any gender-related pay inequities have arisen; &bull;
<p>analyse the nature of any inequities and diagnose the cause or causes; &bull;
<p>determine what action is required to deal with any inequities that are revealed. &bull;
<p>The three main stages to an equal pay review are:
<p>1. Analysis: the collection and analysis of relevant data to identify any gender gaps.
<p>2. Diagnosis: the process of reviewing gender gaps, understanding why they have occurred
and what remedial action might be required if the differences can not be objectively justi-
fied.
<p>3. Action: agreeing and enacting an action plan that eliminates any inequalities.
<p>Defending an equal pay claim
<p>The two most common grounds for defending a claim are: 1) that the work is not equal, and
2) that even if they are equal, there is a genuine material factor that justifies the difference in
pay as long as the justification is objective. Objective justification has to demonstrate that:
<p>The purpose of the provision or practice is to meet a real business need. &bull;
<p>The provision or practice is appropriate and necessary as a means of meeting that &bull;
need.
<p>Employers cannot defend equal value cases on the grounds of the cost of implementation or
the effect a decision could have on industrial relations, and part-time working per se cannot
provide a defence to a claim. A tribunal can ask an independent expert to analyse the jobs and
report on whether or not they are of equal value.
<p>Note that it is not a defence to a claim to say that a lower hourly rate of pay for one person is
compensated for by, for example, a better annual holiday entitlement. The contracts of the
applicant and the comparator have to be compared clause by clause. The applicant can pick
any part of the contract that provides more favourable terms to the comparator.
<p>Proving that the work is not equal
<p>The onus is on the employer to prove that the complainant is not carrying out like work, work
rated as equivalent or work of equal value when compared with the comparator. If the employer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Equal Pay 277
<p>invokes job evaluation to provide support to a claim that the jobs are not equal, the scheme
must be analytical, unbiased and applied in a non-discriminatory way.
<p>&lsquo;Analytical&rsquo; means that the scheme must analyse and compare jobs by reference to factors such
as, in the words of the Equal Pay Regulations, &lsquo;effort, skill, decision&rsquo;. Slotting jobs on a whole-
job comparison basis is not acceptable as a defence. The legislation and case law do not specify
that a point-factor or a scored factor comparison scheme should be used, but even if an &lsquo;ana-
lytical matching&rsquo; process is followed (see Chapter 16) a tribunal may need to be convinced that
this is analytical within the meaning of the Act and has not led to biased decisions.
<p>Genuine material factor
<p>The legislation provides for a case to be made by the employer that there is a &lsquo;genuine material
factor&rsquo; creating and justifying the difference between the pay of the applicant and the compa-
rator. A genuine material factor could be the level of performance or length of service of the
comparator, which means that s/he is paid at a higher level than the applicant in the pay range
for a job. But this only applies if the basis for deciding on additions to pay and the process of
doing so is not discriminatory. The Crossley case referred to above is an example of where a
tribunal found that length of service criteria could be discriminatory if they meant that women
are paid less than men and find it hard to catch up.
<p>Pay differences because of market supplements can be treated as genuine material factors as
long as they are &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;. In the case of a claim that market pressures justify
unequal pay, the tribunal will need to be convinced that this was not simply a matter of opinion
and that adequate evidence from a number of sources was available when the decision was
made. In such cases, the tribunal will also require proof that the recruitment and retention of
the people required by the organization was difficult because pay levels were uncompetitive.
<p>However, The Employment Appeals Tribunal in the case of Sharp v. Caledonia Group Services
(2006) ruled that employers using the genuine material factor defence must &lsquo;objectively justify&rsquo;
it in all cases. This means showing that the pay disparity:
<p>is unrelated to sex; &bull;
<p>relates to a real need of the employer; &bull;
<p>is appropriate to achieving the objective pursued; &bull;
<p>is necessary to that end and is proportionate. &bull;
<p>In other words, the difference must be sensible and necessary rather than merely due to a
material factor.</p>

<br>
<p>278 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Independent experts
<p>If there is any doubt as to whether or not work is of equal value, employment tribunals will
require an independent expert to prepare a report. The expert must:
<p>evaluate the jobs concerned analytically; &bull;
<p>take account of all information supplied and representations that have a bearing on the &bull;
question;
<p>before reporting, send the parties a written summary of the information and invite rep- &bull;
resentations;
<p>include the representations in the report, together with the conclusion reached on the &bull;
case and the reason for that conclusion;
<p>take no account of the difference in sex, and at all times act fairly. &bull;
<p>The independent expert&rsquo;s task differs in a number of ways from that of someone carrying out
a conventional job evaluation within an organization. This is because the aim in the latter case
is to establish relative value by ranking a number of jobs, while an independent expert will be
concerned with comparative value &ndash; comparing the value of a fairly narrow range of jobs.
<p>Equal pay: six tips
Conduct an equal pay review. &bull;
<p>Develop and apply a non-discriminatory analytical job evaluation scheme. &bull;
<p>Ensure that the grade and pay structure is non-discriminatory. &bull;
<p>Ensure that pay system policies and practices in the form of grading jobs, &bull;
procedures for fixing rates of pay and pay progression systems are non-
discriminatory.
<p>Conduct an assessment of the risk of a successful equal pay claim. &bull;
<p>Ensure that line managers are aware of their responsibility to avoid pay &bull;
discrimination.

<p>Market Rate Analysis 281
<p>Introduction
<p>Market rate analysis is conducted through surveys that produce data on the levels of pay and
benefits for similar jobs in comparable organizations. It is the basis either for extreme market
pricing, as defined in Chapter 16, or for maintaining competitive rates of pay and benefits by
deciding on rates of pay for specific jobs or pay ranges in a grade and pay structure.
<p>Aims of market analysis
Obtain relevant, accurate and representative data on market rates. &bull;
<p>Compare like with like, in terms of data, regional and organizational variations &bull;
and, importantly, type and size of job or role.
<p>Obtain information that is as up to date as possible. &bull;
<p>Interpret data in a way that clearly indicates the action required. &bull;
<p>Decisions on levels of pay following market rate analysis will be guided by the pay policy of the
organization or its &lsquo;market stance&rsquo; &ndash; that is, how it wants its pay levels to relate to market
levels.
<p>Effective market rate analysis depends on understanding the concept of a market rate and the
factors affecting the validity and reliability of market rate data, as considered in the first two
parts of this chapter. The rest of the chapter deals with selecting the benchmark jobs used for
comparison, the sources of market rate data and how it should be used.
<p>The concept of a market rate
<p>People often refer to the &lsquo;market rate&rsquo;, but this is a much more elusive concept than it seems.
There is no such thing as a definitive market rate for any job, even when comparing identically
sized organizations in the same industry and location. There are local markets and there are
national markets, and none of them is perfect in the economists&rsquo; sense. Different market infor-
mation sources for the same types of jobs produce different results because of variations in the
sample, the difficulty of obtaining precise matches between jobs in the organization and jobs
elsewhere (job matching), and timing (the dates on which the data is collected may differ).
<p>This means that market rate analysis is most unlikely to produce information on the rate for
the job. The possibly incomplete data from a number of sources, some more reliable than
others, have to be interpreted to indicate what the organization should do about them. The
result of a market rate survey is often what is called a &lsquo;derived rate&rsquo;, which is a judgement on
what appears to be a reasonable rate made on the basis of an analysis of the data obtained from
a number of sources.</p>

<p>282 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Factors determining the validity and reliability of market rate data
Job matching: the extent to which the external jobs with which the internal jobs &bull;
are being compared are similar; in other words, like is being compared with
like.
<p>Sample frame: the degree to which the sample of organizations from which the &bull;
data have been collected is fully representative of the organizations with which
comparisons need to be made in such terms as sector, technology or type of
business, size and location.
<p>Timing: the extent to which the information is up to date or can be updated &bull;
reliably. By their very nature, published surveys, upon which many people rely,
can soon become out of date. This can happen even at the moment they are
published &ndash; pay levels may have changed and people may have moved in or out
since the date of the original survey. Whilst it is not possible to overcome this
completely, as data must be gathered and analysed, surveys that aim to have as
short a time as possible between data collection and the publication of results
are likely to be of more use than those with longer lead times. Estimates can be
made of likely movements since the survey took place, but they are mainly
guesswork.
<p>Job matching
<p>Inadequate job matching is a major cause of inaccuracies in the data collected by market anal-
ysis. So far as possible, the aim is to match the jobs within the organization and those outside
(the comparators) so that like is being compared with like. It is essential to avoid crude and
misleading comparisons based on job titles alone or vague descriptions of job content. It is
first necessary to ensure that a broad match is achieved between the organization concerned
and the types of organizations used as comparators in terms of sector, industry classification,
size and location.
<p>The next step is to match jobs within the organizations concerned. The various methods in
ascending order of accuracy are:
<p>1. Job title: this can be misleading. Job titles by themselves give no indication of the range of
duties or the level of responsibility, and are sometimes used to convey additional status to
employees or their customers regardless of the real level of work done.
<p>2. Brief description of duties and level or zone of responsibility: national surveys frequently
restrict their job-matching definitions to a two or three-line description of duties and an
indication of levels of responsibility in rank order. The latter is often limited to a one-line </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Rate Analysis 283
<p>definition for each level or zone in a hierarchy. This approach provides some guidance on
job matching, which reduces major discrepancies, but it still leaves considerable scope for
discretion and can therefore provide only generalized comparisons.
<p>3. Capsule job descriptions: club or specialist &lsquo;bespoke&rsquo; surveys frequently use capsule job
descriptions that define main responsibilities and duties in about 100 to 200 words. To
increase the refinement of comparisons, modifying statements may be made indicating
where responsibilities are higher or lower than the norm. Capsule job descriptions con-
siderably increase the accuracy of comparisons as long as they are based on a careful anal-
ysis of actual jobs and include modifying statements. But they are not always capable of
dealing with specialist jobs and the accuracy of comparisons in relation to levels of respon-
sibility may be limited, even when modifiers are used.
<p>4. Full role profiles, including a factor analysis of the levels of responsibility involved, may be
used in special surveys when direct comparisons are made between jobs in different organ-
izations. They can be more accurate on a one-for-one basis but their use is limited because
of the time and labour involved in preparing them. A further limitation is that compara-
tor organizations may not have available, or not be prepared to make available, their own
full role profiles for comparison.
<p>5. Job evaluation: can be used in support of a capsule job description or a role profile to
provide a more accurate measure of relative job size. A common method of evaluation is
necessary. An increasing number of international and UK consultancies now claim to be
able to make this link, either through a point-factor scheme or a matching approach.
However, they do not necessarily restrict survey participation only to those organizations
that are prepared to conduct a full evaluation process. This approach will further increase
the accuracy of comparisons but the degree of accuracy will depend on the quality of the
job evaluation process.
<p>Use of benchmark jobs
<p>A market rate survey should aim to collect data on a representative sample of benchmark jobs,
which will be used to provide guidance on the design of a pay structure or as a basis for market
pricing. The jobs selected should be ones for which it is likely that market data will be availa-
ble. There are usually some jobs that are unique to the organization and for which compari-
sons cannot be made. When conducting a market pricing exercise, it is necessary to make a
judgement on the positioning of these jobs in the structure on the basis of comparisons with
the benchmark jobs. A point-factor evaluation scheme, if available, helps to make these com-
parisons more accurate.</p>

<p>284 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Sources of market data
<p>There is a wide variety of sources of varying quality. They include published surveys, special
surveys conducted by organizations, &lsquo;pay clubs&rsquo; (groups of organizations that exchange infor-
mation on pay and benefits) and advertisements. It is not advisable to rely on only one possi-
bly unreliable source.
<p>Should improvements in the quality of job matching be desirable, an individual survey can be
conducted or a salary club can be joined if there is room. If several sources are used, an objec-
tive justification can be produced for any market supplement or premium (an addition to the
normal rate for the job to reflect the market value of a job) that might create unequal pay.
<p>In choosing data sources it is important to take account of how easily replicable the analysis
will be in future years. Trends can only be identified if a consistent set of sources is used, and
if those sources are reasonably stable.
<p>Published surveys
<p>Published surveys are readily accessible and are usually based on a large sample. If the infor-
mation can be obtained online, so much the better. But the sources have to be relevant to the
needs of the organization and particular attention should always be paid to the range of data
and the quality of job matching. Published surveys are of widely varying content, presentation
and quality and are sometimes expensive. They can be national, local, sector, industrial or
occupational.
<p>When selecting a published survey the following questions should be considered:
<p>Does it cover relevant jobs in similar organizations? &bull;
<p>Does it provide the required information on the relevant pay and benefits? &bull;
<p>Are there enough participants to provide acceptable comparisons? &bull;
<p>So far as can be judged, is the survey conducted properly in terms of its sampling tech- &bull;
niques and the quality of job matching?
<p>Is it reasonably up to date? &bull;
<p>Are the results well presented? &bull;
<p>Does it provide value for money? &bull;
<p>As a starting point to identifying a relevant survey, look at the regular reviews included in pub-
lications from Incomes Data Services (IDS) and the Industrial Relations Services (IRS). Pay
analysts IDS also publishes a directory that brings together information on virtually every
available survey of salaries and benefits produced in the UK, providing an unmatched guide to
data sources. It currently lists some 290 surveys of salaries and benefits from 76 UK survey </p>

<p>producers, covering national surveys, local surveys, benefit surveys and international surveys,
and gives details of employee groups and jobs covered by each survey, sample size, date of the
survey data and the length and price of the report. Subscribers to the directory can also access
it online and search for data by job title, type of benefit, sector, UK region or overseas region.

<p>Consultants&rsquo; databases
<p>Many consultancies concerned with reward management have databases of market rates pro-
duced by their own surveys and contacts and often linked to their proprietary job evaluation
scheme.
<p>Special surveys
<p>Special surveys can be &lsquo;do it yourself&rsquo; affairs or they can be conducted for companies by
management consultants. The latter method costs more but it saves a lot of time and trouble,
and some organizations may be more willing to respond to an enquiry from a reputable
consultant.
<p>Conducting a special survey
<p>1. Decide what information is wanted.
<p>2. Identify the &lsquo;benchmark&rsquo; jobs for which comparative pay data is required. This
could have been done as part of a job evaluation exercise as described in Chapter
16.
<p>3. Produce capsule job descriptions for those jobs.
<p>4. Identify the organizations that are likely to have similar jobs.
<p>5. Contact those organizations and invite them to participate. It is usual to say that the
survey findings will be distributed to participants (this is the quid pro quo) and that
individual organizations will not be identified.
<p>6. Provide participants with a form to complete, together with notes for guidance and
capsule job descriptions. This includes provision for participants to indicate by a +
or &ndash; whether the size or scope of the job is larger or smaller than the capsule job
description indicates. Give them a reasonable amount of time to complete and
return the form, say two to three weeks.
<p>7. Analyse the returned forms and distribute a summary of the results to participants.</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>286 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Special surveys can justify the time and trouble, or expense, by producing usefully comparable
data. It may, however, be difficult to get a suitable number of participants to take part, either
because organizations cannot be bothered or because they are already members of a survey
club or take part in a published survey.
<p>Club surveys
<p>Club surveys (pay clubs) are conducted by a number of organizations that agree to exchange
information on pay in accordance with a standard format and on a regular basis. They have all
the advantages of special surveys plus the additional benefits of saving a considerable amount
of time and providing regular information. It is well worth joining one if you can. If a suitable
club does not exist you could always try to start one, but this takes considerable effort.
<p>Advertisements
<p>Many organizations rely on the salary levels published in recruitment advertisements. But
these can be very misleading as you will not necessarily achieve a good match and the quoted
salary may not be the same as what is finally paid. However, although it is highly suspect, data
from advertisements can be used to supplement other more reliable sources.
<p>Other market intelligence
<p>Other market intelligence can be obtained from the publications of IDS and the IRS. This may
include useful information on trends in the &lsquo;going rate&rsquo; for general, across-the-board pay
increases that can be used when deciding on what sort of uplift, if any, is required to pay
scales.
<p>The features of the main sources and their advantages and disadvantages are listed in Table
18.1.
<p>Interpreting and presenting market rate data
<p>Market rate data need to be interpreted by reference to the details provided from each source
and by assessments of their reliability, accuracy and relevance.
<p>Data can be presented as measures of central tendency or measures of dispersion. Measures of
central tendency consist of the arithmetic mean (average) and the median &ndash; the middle item
in a distribution of individual items. The latter is the most commonly used measure because it
avoids the distortions to which arithmetic averages are prone.</p>

<p>Market Rate Analysis 289
<p>Measures of dispersion consist of:
<p>The upper quartile: the value above which 25 per cent of the individual values fall (this &bull;
term is often used more loosely to indicate any value within the top 25 per cent.
<p>The lower quartile: the value below which 25 per cent of the individual values fall. &bull;
<p>The inter-quartile range: the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. &bull;
<p>Using survey data
<p>The use of market survey data as a guide on pay levels is a process based on judgement and
compromise. Different sources may produce different indications of market rate levels. As a
result it is often necessary to produce a &lsquo;derived&rsquo; market rate based on an assessment of the
relative reliability of the data. This would strike a reasonable balance between the competing
merits of the different sources used. It is an intuitive process.
<p>Once all the data available have been collected and presented in the most accessible manner
possible (ie job by job for all the areas the structure is to cover), reference points can be deter-
mined for each pay range in a graded pay structure, as described in Chapter 19. This process
will take account of the place in the market the business wishes to occupy: that is, its market
&lsquo;stance&rsquo; or &lsquo;posture&rsquo;.
<p>Market rate analysis: six tips
Select benchmark jobs for which external market data is available. &bull;
<p>Identify all the sources of market rate information available, including pay &bull;
clubs, published data, consultancies and agencies and other sources of market
rate intelligence.
<p>Evaluate the sources to assess the likelihood of their producing valid and &bull;
reliable information.
<p>Use more than one source to collect as much comparative data as possible. &bull;
<p>Make every attempt to match internal benchmark jobs with jobs covered in the &bull;
data sources in order to compare like with like.
<p>Analyse the data from each source and if variable results are obtained (which is &bull;
likely) use judgement to produce a &lsquo;derived market rate&rsquo; using the most reliable
results.</p>

<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should be able to define these key concepts. You should
also know about:
<p>The nature of grade and pay structures &bull;
<p>Guiding principles for grade and pay &bull;
structures
<p>Types of grade and pay structures &bull;
<p>Choice of grade and pay structure &bull;
<p>Developing a grade and pay structure &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Grade and pay structures provide a framework within which an organization&rsquo;s base pay man-
agement policies are implemented. Base pay management can involve the design and opera-
tion of formal grade and pay structures that define where jobs should be placed in a hierarchy,
what people should be paid for them and the scope for pay progression. Base pay management
enables pay practices to be monitored and controlled, facilitates the management of relativi-
ties, and helps to communicate the pay and sometimes the career opportunities available to
employees. Alternatively, it may be concerned with the administration of unstructured
arrangements consisting of spot rates or individual job grades.
<p>This chapter is mainly concerned with formal grade and pay structures; reference will be made
to the other less formal pay arrangements of spot rates and individual job grades, which, while
not strictly structures, are frequently used by organizations to indicate how much a job or a
person should be paid.
<p>The chapter starts with definitions of grade and pay structures and the other pay arrange-
ments. This is followed by a list of guiding principles for grade and pay structures and descrip-
tions of each type of structure or arrangement, namely: narrow-graded, broad-graded and
broad-banded structures, career and job families, pay spines, spot rates and individual job
grades.
<p>Grade structures
<p>A grade structure consists of a sequence or hierarchy of grades, bands or levels into which
groups of jobs that are broadly comparable in size are placed. There may be a single structure
that is defined by the number of grades or bands it contains; alternatively the structure may be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>292 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>divided into a number of career or job families consisting of groups of jobs where the essential
nature and purpose of the work are similar but the work is carried out at different levels.
<p>The main types of graded structures described in this chapter are:
<p>Narrow-graded structures, which consist of a sequence of narrow grades (generally 10 &bull;
or more). They are sometimes called multi-graded structures.
<p>Broad-graded structures, which have fewer grades (generally six to nine). &bull;
<p>Broad-banded structures, which consist of a limited number of grades or bands (often &bull;
four or five). Structures with six or seven grades are sometimes described as broad-
banded even when their characteristics are typical of broad grades.
<p>Career-family structures, which consist of a number of families (groups of jobs with &bull;
similar characteristics) each divided typically into six to eight levels. The levels are
described in terms of key responsibilities and knowledge, skill and competence require-
ments, and therefore define career progression routes within and between career fami-
lies. There is a common grade and pay structure across all the career families.
<p>Job-family structures, which are similar to career families except that pay levels in each &bull;
family may differ to reflect market rate considerations (this is sometimes referred to as
market grouping). The structure is therefore more concerned with market rate rela-
tivities than mapping careers. The number of levels in families may also vary.
<p>Combined structures, in which broad bands are superimposed on career/job families &bull;
or broad bands are divided into families.
<p>Pay spines, consisting of a series of incremental &lsquo;pay points&rsquo; extending from the lowest &bull;
to the highest-paid jobs covered by the structure.
<p>Pay structures
<p>A grade structure becomes a pay structure when pay ranges, brackets or scales are attached to
each grade, band or level. In some broad-banded structures, as described later in this chapter,
reference points and pay zones may be placed within the bands and these define the range of
pay for jobs allocated to each band.
<p>Pay structures are defined by the number of grades they contain and, especially in narrow or
broad-graded structures, the span or width of the pay ranges attached to each grade. They
define the different levels of pay for jobs or groups of jobs by reference to their relative internal
value as determined by job evaluation, to external relativities as established by market rate
surveys, and sometimes to negotiated rates for jobs. They provide scope for pay progression in
accordance with performance, competence, contribution or service.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 293
<p>There may be a single pay structure covering the whole organization or there may be one
structure for staff and another for manual workers, but this is becoming less common. There
has in recent years been a trend towards &lsquo;harmonizing&rsquo; terms and conditions between differ-
ent groups of staff as part of a move towards single status. This has been particularly evident
in many public sector organizations in the UK, supported by national agreements on &lsquo;single
status&rsquo;. Executive directors are sometimes treated separately.
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward survey found that 35 per cent of respondents had individual pay rates/
ranges/spot salaries, 24 per cent had broad-banded structures (this includes broad-graded
structures), 19 per cent had pay spines, 15 per cent had job or career-family structures and 19
per cent had narrow-graded structures.
<p>Guiding principles for grade and pay structures
<p>Grade and pay structures should:
<p>be appropriate to the culture, characteristics and needs of the organization and its &bull;
employees;
<p>facilitate the management of relativities and the achievement of equity, fairness, con- &bull;
sistency and transparency in managing gradings and pay;
<p>enable jobs to be graded appropriately and not be subject to grade drift; &bull;
<p>be flexible enough to adapt to pressures arising from market rate changes and skill &bull;
shortages;
<p>facilitate operational flexibility and continuous development; &bull;
<p>provide scope as required for rewarding performance, contribution and increases in &bull;
skill and competence;
<p>clarify reward, lateral development and career opportunities; &bull;
<p>be constructed logically and clearly so that the basis upon which they operate can &bull;
readily be communicated to employees;
<p>enable the organization to exercise control over the implementation of pay policies and &bull;
budgets.
<p>Narrow-graded structures
<p>Until fairly recently the typical type of structure was the narrow, multi-graded pay structure
illustrated in Figure 19.1.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>294 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>What
<p>&pound;
<p>Figure 19.1 A narrow-graded structure
<p>However, this type of structure is being replaced in many organizations by structures that have
fewer grades (broad-grade structures) or with broad-banded, career-family or job-family
structures.
<p>Grades in a narrow-graded structure
<p>A narrow-graded structure consists of a sequence of job grades into which jobs of broadly
equivalent value are placed. There may be 10 or more grades, and long-established structures,
especially in the public sector, may have as many as 18. Grades may be defined by a bracket of
job evaluation points so that any job for which the job evaluation score falls with the points
bracket for a grade would be allocated to that grade. Alternatively, grades may be defined by
grade definitions or profiles that, if analytical factor comparison is used as described in Chapter
16, provide the information required to match jobs set out under job demand factor headings.
This information can be supplemented by reference to benchmark jobs that have been already
graded as part of the structure design exercise.
<p>Pay ranges
<p>A pay range is attached to each grade. This allows scope for pay progression related to per-
formance, contribution or competence. In a narrow-graded pay spine, progression is through
fixed increments based on length of service in the job. The four characteristics of pay ranges as
described below are span, reference points or target rates, differentials and overlap.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 295
<p>Span
<p>Pay ranges may be described in terms of their span (the percentage by which the highest point
exceeds the lowest point). This is usually between 20 per cent and 50 per cent (30 to 40 per
cent is typical). A span of 40 per cent would be &pound;20,000 to &pound;28,000. The centre of the range is
called the mid-point.
<p>Alternatively, ranges are described as a percentage of the mid-point, for example, 80 per cent
to 120 per cent. In this case, the mid-point of 100 per cent could be &pound;25,000 and the minimum
and maximum would be &pound;20,000 (80 per cent) and &pound;30,000 (120 per cent) respectively. This
span is on the high side at 50 per cent.
<p>Mid-point management techniques, as described in Chapter 28, can help to control the struc-
ture. They use compa-ratios that express the actual rate of pay as a percentage of the mid-point
when the latter is regarded as the policy rate of pay or the reference point.
<p>Reference point
<p>A reference point or target rate is often defined in each grade, which is the rate for a fully com-
petent individual who is completely qualified to carry out the job. This is sometimes called the
policy rate because it is usually aligned to market rates in accordance with company policies
on the relationship between its pay levels and market rates for similar jobs (its &lsquo;market stance&rsquo;).
The reference point is commonly the mid-point of the pay range for a grade. It may be called
a target rate when it is regarded as the consolidated rate to which individuals should aspire
when they are fully competent and experienced in their roles. In some schemes people who
reach this rate are then only entitled to non-consolidated cash bonuses for exceptional achieve-
ment, although this may be consolidated (ie incorporated in the base rate) if the level of
achievement is sustained over two or three years.
<p>Differentials
<p>Differentials between pay ranges &ndash; the percentage by which the mid-point of a range is higher
than the mid-point of the range below &ndash; are typically between 15 per cent and 20 per cent but
they can be as high as 25 per cent. Too low a differential means that the scope for pay progres-
sion on upgrading is limited. Too high a differential means that a decision to upgrade may
mean that the increase in pay is disproportionate to the increase in responsibility.
<p>Overlap
<p>There is usually an overlap between ranges. Thus if a pay range for a grade is &pound;20,000 to
&pound;24,000 and the range for the grade above is &pound;22,000 to &pound;26,000, the overlap is &pound;2,000 (&pound;24,000
minus &pound;22,000. This is illustrated in Figure 19.2.</p>

<p>Overlap
{
<p>Figure 19.2 Example of overlap
<p>This can be expressed as the difference between the highest point of the range below and the
lowest point of the range above as a percentage of the difference between the lowest and highest
point in the range below by means of the following formula:
<p>24,000 &ndash; 22,000
24,000 &ndash; 20,000
<p>&times; 100 = 50%
<p>In this example the differential between the mid-points of the adjacent grades is fairly low at 9
per cent. Increasing the differential to about 15 per cent and adjusting the higher range to
&pound;23,000&ndash;&pound;28,000 would decrease the overlap to 25 per cent. The degree of overlap can be
manipulated at the design stage by varying differentials and ranges. An overlap provides more
flexibility. It enables recognition to be given to the fact that a highly experienced individual at
the top of a range may be contributing more than someone who is still in the learning curve
portion of the next higher grade.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of narrow-graded structures
<p>Narrow-graded structures provide a framework for managing relativities and for ensuring that
jobs of equal value are paid equally. In theory they are easy to manage because the large number
of grades enables fine distinctions to be made between different levels of responsibility. They
define career ladders, and staff may favour them because they appear to offer plenty of oppor-
tunities for increasing pay by upgrading.
<p>The main problem with narrow, multi-graded structures is that if there are too many grades,
there will be constant pressure for upgrading, leading to grade drift (unjustified upgradings).
They can be aligned to a traditional extended hierarchy that may no longer exist, and can func-
tion rigidly, which is at odds with the requirement of flexibility in new team and process-based
organizations. They also reinforce the importance of promotion as a means of progression,
which may run counter to the need for organizations to be more flexible and grow capability
by moving people within grades to broaden their experience and competencies.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 297
<p>Example: Lands&rsquo; End
<p>Salaried staff at Lands&rsquo; End are on a 10-grade pay structure, with the bottom two grades over-
lapping with hourly rates of pay and the top grade covering directors. Each grade has a range,
divided into thirds:
<p>Bottom third of the range: for those who have moved into the job, and are developing &bull;
their skills; staff generally stay in it for about 18 months.
<p>Middle third of the grade: for effective and experienced staff; many will stay in this &bull;
third.
<p>Top third: for the best performers, those who are pushing at the limits of the job and &bull;
who are regularly appraised as highly effective.
<p>Broad-graded structures
<p>Broad-graded structures generally have six to nine grades rather than the 10 or more grades
contained in narrow-graded structures. More and more organizations are adopting them
because they represent the realities of hierarchies in today&rsquo;s &lsquo;flatter&rsquo; structures, are easier to
manage, can be used more flexibly and can reduce grade drift.
<p>The grades and pay ranges are defined and managed in the same way as narrow-graded struc-
tures except that wider pay spans mean that organizations sometimes introduce mechanisms
to control progression in the grade so that staff do not inevitably reach its upper pay limit. The
mechanisms available consist of:
<p>Reference point control: scope is provided for progression according to competence by &bull;
increments to the reference point. Thereafter, individuals may earn cash bonuses for
high achievement, which may be consolidated up to the maximum pay for the grade if
high achievement levels are sustained.
<p>Threshold control: a point is defined in the pay range beyond which pay cannot increase &bull;
unless individuals achieve a defined level of competence and achievement.
<p>Segment or zone control: an extension of threshold control that involves dividing the &bull;
grade into, usually, three segments or zones.
<p>All these mechanisms require the use of some form of contingent pay, as described in
Chapter 10.
<p>Broad-graded structures are used to overcome or at least alleviate the grade drift problem
endemic in narrow-graded structures. If the grades are defined, it is easier to differentiate
them, and matching (comparing role profiles with grade definitions or profiles to find the best
fit) becomes more accurate. But it may be difficult to control progression and this would </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>298 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>increase the costs of operating such systems, although these costs could be offset by better
control of grade drift.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Bristol-Myers Squibb
<p>Pay is determined in relation to the market, and is pitched at the median, though the total
reward package is upper quartile. There are eight overlapping bands, each with a span of
between 80 per cent and 100 per cent, covering everyone apart from the UK&rsquo;s dozen or so
senior executives. The bands are:
<p>D 1 Basic clerical, factory semi-skilled.
<p>D 2 Clerical and factory semi-skilled.
<p>D 3 Clerical and factory supervisor.
<p>D 4 Senior supervisor, entry level for professionals (eg scientists), customer-facing sales staff.
<p>D 5 Customer-facing sales staff.
<p>D 6 First level manager, head of department.
<p>D 7 Function heads.
<p>D 8 Business heads, eg oncology, finance.
<p>These eight bands are used in all the countries in which Bristol-Myers Squibb operates, though
the salaries attached to them are locally determined. But the bands are seen as more of a safety
net than anything else and something that the US parent is keen to retain, although the market
is more important in the UK. The company says the bands are helpful if there is an intention
to recruit someone at a salary way over or under the band, which signals that the job may need
to be re-graded.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Camelot
<p>The broad-graded structure at Camelot is market driven &ndash; its focus is on paying the market
rate for each job. Every salary is benchmarked against the market to ensure that jobholders are
being &lsquo;paid fairly for the job that they do&rsquo;, with base pay set at the median market rate. The fol-
lowing six-level banding structure, covering everyone except the chief executive, is used:
<p>Bands A and B cover administrative support and IT roles. &bull;
<p>Band C includes supervisors, professionals and specialists. &bull;
<p>Band D is for middle management. &bull;
<p>Band E is for heads of department. &bull;
<p>Band F covers functional directors. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 299
<p>Bands have some overlap, and each job has its own pay range within a band. The range is 85
per cent to 115 per cent, with 100 per cent being the rate for the job. The ranges are bench-
marked against the market twice a year.
<p>Example of broad-grading at COLT Telecom
<p>There are nine job levels or grades at COLT Telecom. They were introduced as a way of:
<p>providing transparency in the organizational structure; &bull;
<p>providing an equitable reward framework for base pay, variable pay and long-term &bull;
incentives;
<p>ensuring consistency and fairness across functions and countries; &bull;
<p>allowing cross-function and country comparison; &bull;
<p>beginning to clarify career development and progression; &bull;
<p>supporting the &lsquo;One COLT&rsquo; culture and values of open and honest communication; &bull;
<p>aiding internal and external benchmarking of remuneration. &bull;
<p>COLT levels seek to aid succession planning and promotion. An advantage of having a formal
job level structure is that managers will be able to communicate how and when their team
members can progress. As the levels are fairly broad, not all promotions or role changes will
result in a level change. However, if a role changes or a move is made within the organization
to a different department, the job level can be reviewed and adjusted as appropriate.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Friends Provident
<p>At Friends Provident there are eight bands, five for non-management staff, to replace the nine
previous grades, and three additional bands to cover everyone below executive director level.
Generic skills and competency levels have been established to describe the broad requirements
for each band. Each of the career bands is broad, and although there is a mid-point the
company tells staff that they should not believe that the rate for the job is the mid-point or
control point. Staff who are developing their role should be in the lower quartile of the range,
staff who are fully performing are at the median, while those who are regularly exceeding all
requirements should be being paid at the upper quartile. A normal distribution would be 25
per cent developing, 50 per cent fully performing and 25 per cent exceeding requirements.
<p>Example of broad-grading at Lloyds TSB
<p>Every role in Lloyds TSB has a market reference point that indicates the normal rate of pay for
a fully effective performer. There is a published salary range for each grade (in other words, a </p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>300 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>minimum and maximum salary) based on pay rates within the market. Each grade has three
zones:
<p>Primary zone: for people new to the role and still developing in that role. Typically &ndash; &bull;
but not in every case &ndash; Lloyds TSB expects an employee to be performing to a &lsquo;fully
effective&rsquo; level after two or three years in the role and to move to the next zone. If an
employee&rsquo;s salary is currently below the bottom zone and his or her work is judged sat-
isfactory, pay will automatically be adjusted upwards.
<p>Market zone: if an employee is fully effective in a role, his or her pay should be managed &bull;
towards or in the &lsquo;market&rsquo; zone (if an employee moves to a new role, pay will start in
the market zone as long as he or she has the necessary knowledge, competencies and
skills to be fully effective from the outset). Broadly speaking, the market zone reflects
the rate that other employers would pay for a particular job. These rates are set with
data provided by independent pay consultants.
<p>High-performance zone: if an employee consistently makes a superior contribution to &bull;
the business, his or her pay is managed towards or in the high-performance zone.
<p>Work levels at Unilever
<p>Unilever rejected the notion of broad-banding and introduced its &lsquo;work level&rsquo; structure in the
mid-1990s. This is a variation of broad-grading using different nomenclature and a special
approach to defining levels. There are six work levels, each subdivided into a number of pay
grades. The levels were determined according to the idea of the time-span of discretion devel-
oped by Eliot Jaques (1961) and also measure the strategic importance of particular jobs. The
three principles underlying levels are:
<p>The major tasks of any job fall into a single work level. This is the case despite the fact &bull;
that a job may include a mixture of tasks, with an executive making strategic decisions
also undertaking less demanding administrative tasks.
<p>At each successive higher work level, decisions of a broader nature are taken in an &bull;
increasingly complex environment. Discretion and the authority required to do the job
also increase, and more time is required to assess the impact of these decisions. Assign-
ing jobs to work levels involves identifying the decisions that are unique to a job. This
helps to highlight differences in management decision making and accountability,
which in turn allows the management structure to be more clearly delineated.
<p>Each work level above the first requires one and only one layer of management. A layer &bull;
of management is necessary only where a manager makes decisions that could not be
taken by subordinates, who may be more than one level below their boss. The compa-
ny&rsquo;s work levels approach ensures that job holders take decisions that cannot be taken
at a lower level.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 301
<p>Broad-banded structures
<p>Broad-banded structures have up to six &lsquo;bands&rsquo; as distinct from the 10 or more grades in a
narrow-graded structure and the six to nine grades in a broad-graded structure, as illustrated
in Figure 19.3. The term broad-banded is often used to describe a structure with over six bands
or grades but it is useful to make the distinction between broad-graded structures, which are
managed in the same way as narrow-graded structures, and broad-banded structures, which
are managed quite differently as described below. The process of developing broad-banded
structures is called &lsquo;broad-banding&rsquo;.
<p>Genesis of the concept
<p>The notion of broad-banding crossed the Atlantic in the early 1990s, although it was referred
to, briefly, by Armstrong and Murlis in 1988. An article by Leblanc (1992) produced one of the
earliest definitions of broad-banding: &lsquo;Fewer pay grades for all types of jobs and more hori-
zontal (lateral) movement&rsquo;. Broad-banding really came to the fore in the mid-1990s when
Gilbert and Abosch (1996) wrote about how it had been developed in General Electric in
support of the Jack Welch philosophy of boundaryless (and de-layered) organizations. Since
then it has burgeoned.
<p>The difference between a broad-graded structure and a broad-banded structure is important.
It was originally made by Gilbert and Abosch in 1996. They referred to broad-grade structures
with seven or eight grades in which a fairly conventional approach to pay management is often
adopted using mid-point management, compa-ratio analysis and pay matrix techniques. They
contrasted these with what they called &lsquo;career band&rsquo; structures with four to five bands where
the emphasis is on individual career development, flexible roles and competence growth.

<p>302 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>The original concept of broad-banding
<p>In its original version, a broad-banded structure contained no more than five bands, each
with, typically, a span of 70 per cent to 100 per cent. Bands were unstructured and pay was
managed much more flexibly than in a conventional graded structure (no limits may be
defined for progression) and much more attention was paid to market rates, which governed
what were in effect the spot rates for jobs within bands. Progression in bands depended on
competency and the assumption of wider role responsibilities. Bands were described verbally,
not by reference to the results of analytical job evaluation. More authority was devolved to line
managers to make pay decisions within a looser framework.
<p>Research conducted by Armstrong and Ryden (1997) found that in the 10 organizations they
studied the median number of bands was five. There were no fixed limits to bands in three of
them and the others typically had limits of up to 100 per cent.
<p>Later research by Armstrong and Brown (2001) established that in organizations with broad
bands, 62 per cent had bands with widths between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, while the rest
had bands with widths between 75 per cent and 100 per cent. Typically, there were between
four and six bands in such structures. The band boundaries were often, but not always, defined
by job evaluation. Jobs were placed in the bands purely by reference to market rates or by a
combination of job evaluation and market rate analysis. Bands were described by an overall
description of the jobs allocated to them (senior management etc) or by reference to the
generic roles they contained, for instance technical support.
<p>This concept was, and still is, beguiling. Broad-banded structures are simpler and therefore
easier to design. They satisfy the desire for more flexibility, and Armstrong and Brown&rsquo;s (2001)
research established that this was by far the most important reason for introducing broad-
bands. Flexibility is achieved by catering for broader roles rather than tightly defined jobs, by
adopting less rigid approaches to the allocation of roles to bands and how people progress
within them, and by being able to respond more quickly to market rate pressures. In the
United States the advantages of doing without formal job evaluation and using market pricing
were originally the most powerful arguments in favour of broad-banding. This remains the
case there, but in the UK the use of job evaluation rather than market pricing is still common
and the original concept of broad-banded structures has never been taken up as enthusiasti-
cally as in the United States. An aspect of flexibility that is seldom discussed in public is that
when introducing broad-bands the wider span of pay means that fewer anomalies are created
and the cost of implementation is reduced.
<p>Moreover, broad-banding was in accord with the drive for de-layering. The reduction in the
number of grades meant that the pressure for upgrading was reduced, there was less likelihood
of grade drift and it was thought that grades would be easier to manage.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 303
<p>Further developments in the concept
<p>The original notion of unstructured broad bands is now no longer general practice in the UK.
It created expectations of the scope for progression that could not be met. Progression had to
stop somewhere if costs were going to be controlled, and no rationale was available for decid-
ing when and why to stop. Line managers felt adrift without adequate guidance and staff
missed the structure they were used to. Questions were asked about the point of having broad
bands at all when in effect all they consisted of was spot rates determined mainly by market
relativities. Why, people asked, should organizations not be honest with themselves and their
staff and revert to the complete freedom and therefore flexibility that spot rates provide?
<p>Inevitably, therefore, structure crept in. It started with reference points aligned to market rates
around which similar roles could be clustered. These were then extended into zones for individ-
ual jobs or groups of jobs, as illustrated in Figure 19.4 (based on a structure in a financial services
company). Reference points are frequently placed in zones so that they increasingly resemble
conventional structure grades. Armstrong and Brown (2001) established that 80 per cent of
organizations had introduced some controls in the form of zones (43 per cent) and zones with
reference points (37 per cent). Job evaluation was used not only to define the boundaries of the
band but to size jobs as a basis for deciding where reference points should be placed in conjunc-
tion with market pricing. Progressively, therefore, the original concept of broad-banding was
eroded as more structure was introduced and job evaluation became more prominent to define
the structure and meet equal pay requirements. Zones within broad bands began to look very
like conventional grades. An example of a broad-banded structure linked to job evaluation is
given in Figure 19.5 (based on a structure developed for Notting Hill Housing Association).

<p>Band definitions
<p>There are five ways of defining bands, as set out below. The first four are descriptive in increas-
ing degrees of complexity. They simplify the process of allocating roles to bands although
judgement is required. However, this may not matter too much if there is a considerable
amount of overlap in pay spans or opportunities between adjacent bands. The fifth method is
the use of job evaluation.
<p>1. Descriptive labels: these refer to the generic roles that have been allocated to bands &ndash; for
example, senior managers, managers, team leaders, individual contributors (technical
and professional) and individual contributors (administration and support).
<p>2. Outline generic descriptions of jobs in band: these briefly expand descriptive labels, eg:
<p>Senior managers: executives in charge of a major function or department. &ndash;
<p>Managers: of a sub-division of a major function or department, or a small &ndash;
department.
<p>Team leaders: in charge of a small team of individual contributors. &ndash;
<p>Individual contributors (technical and professional): junior technical or profes- &ndash;
sional specialists working as members of a team.
<p>Individual contributors (administration and support): members of teams carrying &ndash;
out basic administrative or support roles.

<p>4. Extended analytical description of bands: a full analysis of the generic characteristics of
jobs in the bands is illustrated in Figure 19.7.
<p>5. Use of job evaluation: bands can be defined in terms of a range of job evaluation points,
as illustrated in Figure 19.5. Jobs are traditionally graded in conventional pay structures
through analytical job evaluation &ndash; points brackets are attached to each grade and indi-
vidual roles are &lsquo;sized&rsquo; and allocated into grades by comparing scores with the points
brackets attached to them. The difference when developing a broad-banded structure is
that an a priori decision may have been made on the number of bands and how they
should be described and defined. In these circumstances, job evaluation is simply used to
determine points dimensions for the bands as a guide to where roles should be allocated.
<p>Allocation of jobs to bands
<p>When bands are defined descriptively, a job slotting or analytical matching approach can be
used to allocate jobs to them. Slotting is the process of placing a job in a band by reference to
grade definitions that have not been analysed into factors. It is essentially the non-analytical
job evaluation technique of job classification, but it is easier to make decisions if broad generic
definitions exist for a small number of bands than in a multi-graded structure. Analytical
matching means allocating benchmark roles to bands by comparing their characteristics as
expressed in a role profile with the previously prepared band definitions or profiles that have </p>
<br>

<p>&bull; Occasional supervision of staff temporarily assigned or shared supervision or permanent staff.
&bull; Creativity is a feature of the job but exercised within the general framework of recognized procedures.
&bull; Contacts which are generally not contentious but where the need or potential outcome may not be
<p>straightforward, or where the circumstances call for an element of tact or sensitivity. Contacts at this level would
include interviewing to establish details or service needs, the supply of straightforward advice, and initiating action
to provide assistance. Contacts within the organization would require the provision of advice or guidance on
matters that are less well established.
<p>&bull; Work is carried out within policies and objectives where there is a wide range of choices and where advice is not
normally available.
<p>&bull; Decisions that have significant implications for the organization or significant effects on employees or other
individuals or other organizations.
<p>&bull; Ability to undertake work concerning more involved tasks confined to one function or area of activity that
requires a good standard or practical knowledge and skills in that area of activity.

<p>been analysed into factors. Valid allocations can be made quickly if a good analytical frame-
work exists. Analytical matching is a form of job evaluation, but it is much simpler and less
time-consuming than point-factor job evaluation because detailed measurement is not
required.
<p>Where bands are described in terms of job evaluation scores, the allocation can be made by
reference to an evaluation using a point-factor scheme. However, analytical matching is being
increasingly used for broad bands and, indeed, in conventional graded structures.
<p>Reservations about broad-banding
<p>The two reservations that emerged from the experience of developing broad bands in the
1990s and early 2000s were: 1) What&rsquo;s the point of unstructured broad bands if they simply
consist of spot rates? and 2) What&rsquo;s the difference between, say, a four-banded structure with
three zones in each band and a 12-graded structure? The answer given by broad band devotees
to the first question was that at least there was some overall structure within which spot rates
could be managed. In reply to the second question, the usual answer was that as roles develop,
movements between zones within bands could be dealt with more flexibly. Neither of these
responses is particularly convincing.
<p>Objections to broad-banding
<p>Apart from these fundamental reservations, there are a number of other objections to broad-
banding. In general, it has been found that broad-banded structures are harder to manage
than narrower graded structures in spite of the original claim that they would be easier &ndash; they
make considerable demands on line managers as well as HR. It was noted by Armstrong (2000)
that broad-banding was not an easy option. Pay can spin out of control unless steps are taken </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 307
<p>to prevent that happening. As a reward manager in an engineering company told him: &lsquo;Broad
bands offer huge scope for flexibility, but equally huge scope for getting it wrong.&rsquo;
<p>Broad-banding can build employee expectations of significant pay opportunities, which are
doomed in many cases if proper control of the system is maintained. It can be difficult to
explain to people how broad-banding works and how they will be affected, and they may be
concerned by the apparent lack of structure and precision. Decisions on movements within
bands can be harder to justify objectively than in other types of grade and pay structures.
<p>Broad-banded structures may be more costly than more conventional structures because there
is less control over pay progression. Research conducted by Fay et al (2004) in the United
States found that both base pay and total cash compensation was significantly higher in the
companies with broad-banded structures than in those with more conventional structures.
They estimated that broad-banding increased pay roll costs by 7 per cent plus.
<p>Another major objection to broad-banding is that it can create the following equal pay
problems:
<p>Reliance on external relativities (market rates) to place jobs in bands can reproduce &bull;
existing inequalities in the labour market.
<p>The broader pay ranges within bands mean that they include jobs of widely different &bull;
values or sizes, which may result in gender discrimination.
<p>Women may be assimilated at their present rates in the lower regions of bands and find &bull;
it impossible, or at least very difficult, to catch up with their male colleagues who,
because of their existing higher rates of pay, are assimilated in the upper reaches of
bands.
<p>Broad-banding in its original sense is therefore not the panacea it was once thought to be.
More organizations are settling for a broad-graded structure with six to nine grades, with the
possibility of restricting the number to five but recognizing that they have to contain control
mechanisms that might take the form of a series of zones.
<p>Examples
Britannia Building Society
<p>The Britannia Building Society has a six-band structure, although within these there are 38
separate role profiles. The pay ranges for the bands are based on external market comparisons.
Mapping individual staff to the role profiles involved a process of job evaluation and valida-
tion by management teams.</p>

<p>308 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>GlaxoSmithKline
<p>GlaxoSmithKline has five bands: A and B for are for top executives, band C is for directors and
managers, band D covers professional and technical staff and band E comprises administrative
staff. These bands determine benefit entitlements. Pay for manufacturing staff is negotiated
with the trade unions; these job grades are subject to local agreement and are not included in
the grading structure.
<p>Each band is divided into a number of zones for pay purposes. For example, band D is divided
into six zones, and band E has five zones. The combination of band and zone produces the
grade, and there are 29 grades in total. These grades are also important for determining bonus
entitlement. The pay for each grade ranges approximately 25 per cent either side of the range
mid-point.
<p>Tesco
<p>The broad-banded structure consists of six &lsquo;work levels&rsquo; that cover all staff from the shopfloor
to the main board, replacing the previous 22 grades:
<p>Work level 1 covers all clerical jobs. &bull;
<p>Work levels 2, 3 and 4 cover all staff other than those in clerical jobs and directors. The &bull;
maximum of each of the bands in these levels is at least 100 per cent above the
minimum.
<p>Work levels 5 and 6 are for main board and senior directors, whose pay is determined &bull;
on an individual basis.
<p>Career-family structures
<p>Career or job families consist of jobs in a function or occupation such as marketing, opera-
tions, finance, IT, HR, administration or support services that are related through the activ-
ities carried out and the basic knowledge and skills required, but in which the levels of
responsibility, knowledge, skill or competency needed differ. In a career-family structure as
illustrated in Figure 19.8, the different career families are identified and the successive levels
in each family are defined by reference to the key activities carried out and the knowledge
and skills or competencies required to perform them effectively. They therefore define career
paths &ndash; what people have to know and be able to do to advance their career within a family
and to develop career opportunities in other families. These career paths are the distin-
guishing characteristic of career-family structures, which are as much about defining career
progression routes as they are about defining a pay structure. Typically, career families have
between six and eight levels, as in broad-graded structures. Some families may have more
levels than others.</p>

<p>In effect, a career structure is a single graded structure in which each grade has been divided
into families. The difference between a conventional graded structure and a career-family
structure is that in the former the grade definitions are all the same. In a career-family struc-
ture, although the levels may be defined generally for all families, separate definitions expressed
as competency requirements exist for levels in each of the career families.
<p>Competency-defined grades or bands in a career-family structure
<p>Defining grades or bands in terms of competencies results in what Risher (2002) describes as
a &lsquo;career ladder&rsquo; structure. He reports the practice of three companies &ndash; Dow, IBM and Mar-
riott Hotels &ndash; which have defined a set of brief competency factors or criteria that provide a
simple and transparent framework based on levels in a career ladder. The criteria consist of the
competencies such as knowledge, skills and abilities required at each level.
<p>An example of a UK approach to career ladders is provided by the NHS as part of its &lsquo;Agenda
for Change&rsquo; project. Its skills ladder is illustrated in Figure 19.9.</p>

<p>Advantages and disadvantages
<p>Career-family structures provide the foundation for personal development planning by defin-
ing the knowledge, skills and competencies required at higher levels or in different functions,
and describing what needs to be learnt through experience, education or training. Level defi-
nitions in a family can be more accurate than in a conventional structure because they concen-
trate on roles within the family with common characteristics and do not attempt to cover a
wide and in some ways unconnected set of skills across the whole organization. Furthermore,
the existence of a common grading system when it is supported by job evaluation facilitates
the achievement of equal pay for work of equal value. Finally, linking pay and grade manage-
ment with career development is in accordance with good practice human resource manage-
ment in the shape of &lsquo;bundling&rsquo; &ndash; the belief, supported by extensive research, that HR practices
will be more effective if they are interrelated and therefore complement and reinforce one
another.
<p>But career structures can be more difficult to develop, explain and manage than single grade
structures. A considerable amount of work is required to produce clear analytical level defini-
tions that are properly graded and provide good career guidelines. A broad-graded structure,
for example, is a simple and straightforward concept, and splitting it into families may increase
the complexity without providing commensurate benefits. Maintaining the accuracy of the
level definitions also demands much care and attention. It is these problems that are perhaps
the main reason why career structures have not yet caught on.
<p>Furthermore, whatever emphasis is placed on career development between as well as within
families, they could be perceived as being divisive and in conflict with the principle of identical
treatment for all enshrined in a single grade structure. It may be inferred that progression can </p>

<p>only take place in an occupational &lsquo;silo&rsquo;. This has meant that career-family approaches have
been abandoned where the silos have been narrowly drawn and managed rigidly &ndash; the simpler
they are the better.
<p>Examples
Career families at Aegon UK
<p>The range of different roles within the business has been organized into four career families,
which are defined as groups of jobs where the technical knowledge and behavioural skills are
similar and recognizable by the external labour market. The families are operations delivery,
team leader and technical, junior management, professional and senior technical, and man-
agement and senior professional.
<p>The aim is to provide information on development opportunities and career paths that, as
part of a performance management process, can contribute to performance development and
training. Within each career family there are defined career paths for progressing to higher
levels by clarifying what skills individuals have to demonstrate if they wish to move to a new
career path. The career families can therefore provide the foundation for personal develop-
ment planning by defining the knowledge and skills required at higher levels or in different
functions and what needs to be learnt through experience, education or training. Employees
are able to understand not only how they can develop their skills and competence within their
current role, but also how they can move through their career path to specialist roles. Routes
are also shown into career paths in other parts of the organization.
<p>Career bands at Friends Provident
<p>The pay structure at Friends Provident has eight overlapping career bands below executive
director level. Bands A to E cover non-management staff, as shown in Table 19.1 and the
three additional bands are manager, head of department and director. Career bands reflect
each of the significant steps in an individual&rsquo;s career. Movement from one band to another
is earned when individuals demonstrate real potential for working to the higher level of
skills and knowledge and when there is a requirement for someone at this level within the
business unit.
<p>Each band is broadly defined in terms of the minimum expected level of competence required
for entry. This aims to encourage a focus on the requirements at either end of the band, and
therefore highlight the range of salary potential between the two.
<p>In bands A and B, staff are carrying out generalist administrative support functions, so the
differentials between job families tend to be insignificant. Salary ranges apply to all staff
across the company and are not related to job family (though the impact of location is
recognized).</p>
