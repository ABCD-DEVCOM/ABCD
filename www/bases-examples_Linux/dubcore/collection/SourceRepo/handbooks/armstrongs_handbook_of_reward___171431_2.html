<p>E Assistant customer services manager (responsible for 30&ndash;40 staff)
<p>In career bands C, D and E, however, staff will often be following a specific career path and will
be developing specialist skills and knowledge and possibly studying for additional qualifica-
tions. The market rates of pay reflect this with noticeable differences in the rates of pay for dif-
ferent job families.
<p>Career-family structure at Norwich Union Insurance
<p>There are 19 career families, defined as a cluster of jobs with similar skill requirements and
activities. Levels of responsibility vary within the family. The career framework helps staff to
understand how their jobs fit within their business unit and the organization as a whole and
supports movement across the organization, since individuals can identify jobs at a similar
level in other families that they might like to join. The skills, knowledge and behaviours profile
for each role is published to facilitate this. Each family contains between four and seven levels,
each with a pay range with an 80 per cent minimum, a market salary guide for competent per-
formance and no maximum. Career families also aim to facilitate the payment of market rates,
since jobs can be benchmarked more directly with comparable jobs elsewhere.
<p>Each of the career bands is broad, and although there is clearly a mid-point the company tells
staff that they should not believe that the rate for the job is the mid-point or control point.
Broadly speaking, staff who are developing their role should be in the lower quartile of the
range, staff who are fully performing are at the median while those who are regularly exceed-
ing all requirements should be being paid at the upper quartile. A normal distribution would
be 25 per cent developing, 50 per cent fully performing and 25 per cent exceeding require-
ments.

<p>while teaching, learning and research are the reasons the university exists, managerial and

the definition of career paths between families, especially from learning support roles to teach-
ing and research roles.

<p>314 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Career families at NSPCC
<p>There are seven career families in the NSPCC covering the different job functions such as
Work with children, Fundraising, IT and Finance. The families were developed by evaluating
all jobs using a new and tailor-made system of analytical job matching. Detailed role profiles
were written and then jobs were slotted into the new structure of seven grades by matching
them with the most appropriate grade description.
<p>Career-family structure at XANSA
<p>The categorization of career families, jobs, jobs map and skills profiles for each job at XANSA
is known as the career framework. It is a tool that provides a common approach to people
development and performance management and is designed to help employees and line
managers to:
<p>identify career options; &bull;
<p>prepare for performance review and personal development discussions; &bull;
<p>assess suitability for job moves; &bull;
<p>identify training and development needs; &bull;
<p>assist in recruitment and selection interviews; &bull;
<p>position new employees into appropriate roles. &bull;
<p>The career families fall into four groups:
<p>Delivery: design, build/integrate, run and support, management, business services and &bull;
training.
<p>Consultancy. &bull;
<p>Business development: general management, sales and strategic development, and &bull;
client development.
<p>Professional support: business support, finance human resources and marketing/com- &bull;
munications.
<p>Job-family structures
<p>Job-family structures as illustrated in Figure 19.10 resemble career structures, in that separate
families are identified and levels of knowledge, skills and competency requirements defined
for each level, thus indicating career paths and providing the basis for grading jobs by match-
ing role profiles to level definitions. Like career families, job families may have different
numbers of levels depending on the range of responsibility they cover.</p>

<p>job families
<p>Figure 19.10 A job-family structure
<p>The difference between a career-family structure and a job-family structure is that in the
former there is a common grade and pay structure. Jobs in the same level in each career family
are deemed to be the same size as assessed by job evaluation, and the pay ranges in corre-
sponding levels across the career families are the same. In contrast, the families in a job-family
structure have in effect their own pay structures that take account of different levels of market
rates between families (this is sometimes called &lsquo;market grouping&rsquo;). The size of jobs and rates
of pay can vary between the same levels in different job families, which means that there may
be no read-across between them unless they are underpinned by job evaluation. Because they
may cover a number of market groups, there are often more families in a job-family structure
than in a career-family structure.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages
<p>Job-family structures can help organizations to flex rates of pay for different occupations to
reflect variations in market rates and therefore provide for competitive pay to attract and
retain people with essential skills. They can also indicate career paths within and, to a certain
extent, between families.
<p>But they can result in unequal pay for work of equal value between job families. This can arise
if jobs of the same size are paid differently when pay levels vary between families to cater for
market rate pressures. Such variations may be difficult to justify objectively because the market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>316 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>pay differentials in job-family structures are common to a whole family. In other structures,
including career-family structures, the alternative and preferable approach is to use market
supplements, which are easier to justify on an individual basis. Pay inequities in job-family
structures can also arise because of read-across difficulties when trying to assess the relative
size of jobs in different families. In theory this problem can be solved by the use of job evalu-
ation but in practice this is difficult when there are considerable differences in the structure
and definition of family levels.
<p>In addition, like career-family structures, job families can be more difficult to develop, explain
and manage than single grade structures.
<p>Examples
Job-family structure at BT
<p>The overall objective of setting up the new grade and pay structure in BT was to be simple and
complete, avoiding over-complicated structures. More specifically, the company decided to
opt for a system of job families in order to:
<p>achieve internal consistency of reward in alignment with external market rates; &bull;
<p>ensure that status, rank and relative position within hierarchies will become less impor- &bull;
tant than what an individual achieves;
<p>help to clarify the roles and potential career paths available to individuals, particularly &bull;
within a job family and, to a certain extent, between families;
<p>offer visibility of roles and salary ranges across other job families; &bull;
<p>achieve more flexibility in managing reward for different occupations to reflect differ- &bull;
ences in market rates and therefore provide for competitive pay to attract and retain
people with essential skills.
<p>The job-family structure was developed to replace a traditional graded structure containing
eight core grades together with a separate sales structure. Ranges were &lsquo;quite broad&rsquo; with sig-
nificant overlap. According to the Connect trade union, there were &lsquo;deep-rooted problems&rsquo;
with the system. In what was once a typical multi-graded pay structure the emphasis was very
much on hierarchy: the only way ahead was upward, through promotion or re-grading. The
focus is now on flexible roles and the individual&rsquo;s contribution in the role, and more priority
is given to external competitiveness. A salary range provides BT line managers with flexibility
in managing reward within their teams. Gone are the days when pay progression and career
development at BT were simply a matter of getting promotion to a higher grade.</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 317
<p>A job-family structure in the Financial Services Authority (FSA)
<p>The FSA has 12 job families that vary in size from the 38 people in economics and research to
900 in regulatory. Within each job family there are a number of broad levels, ranging from
four to six according to the family. The levels reflect the different contributions that individu-
als make according to their skills, knowledge and experience, and the roles they perform.
<p>Each level has an associated indicative pay range that has been determined by comparing levels
in the markets in which the FSA competes for staff. Pay ranges are used rather than a specific
rate for the job, to reflect that there is no single market rate of pay for a given job. Instead,
there is a range of pay in the market related to the specific backgrounds, experience and deliv-
ery of individuals performing the roles. The broad overlapping ranges are designed to give
management the flexibility to reflect the differences in contribution that individuals are
making.
<p>A job-family structure at IMS Health
<p>An example of a job-family approach is provided by IMS Health, a global business providing
information for pharmaceutical companies that employs a large proportion of scientists. The
aim of the development programme was &lsquo;to evolve a system which could be flexible enough to
cope with the ever-changing business environment we were in&rsquo;. The reason for going down
the job-family route was that it would give IMS Health the flexibility needed, bearing in mind
the different functions operating in the organization. Defining career paths was an important
consideration affecting the decision to develop job families, as was the need to focus on estab-
lishing appropriate pay levels in each job family that were related to market rates. The progres-
sion policy is for a personal development plan to be prepared for individuals who were
recruited to a role below the reference point that would enable them to reach the level of com-
petence required. A salary development plan would also be prepared to bring up the individ-
ual&rsquo;s rate of pay to the reference point. Progression to the reference point (in effect
competence-related pay) is determined by managers within their budgets. Individuals were
briefed during induction both on the career opportunities available to them and the reward
associated with their progress.
<p>A job-family structure at Kent County Council
<p>Jobs are allocated to one of 35 generic job profiles organized into seven job families. They were
evaluated using the Hay system and then placed into one of six pay grades. Summary band
descriptions of these grades have been written to provide staff with a better understanding of
why their job falls in a particular grade, and the analytical points factor system ensures that
staff are all evaluated on a fair and equal basis.</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>318 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>A job-family structure at Nationwide
<p>Nationwide decided to opt for a system of job families because they:
<p>offer the flexibility to respond to occupational and labour market pressures, in contrast &bull;
to more rigid systems where market rates may fall outside the grading structure;
<p>encourage flexible working practices and multiskilling; &bull;
<p>encourage people to move jobs and build up a broad base of skills in different areas &bull;
while still remaining in the same job family, although there must be flexibility in the
pay ranges to reward people for this;
<p>clarify routes to career progression; &bull;
<p>flatten the organizational structure, driving accountability down to the lowest pos- &bull;
sible level so that the person dealing with the customers is empowered to solve their
problems.
<p>The job-family structure was developed following a detailed analysis of work. Jobs across the
whole organization were found to fall into three broad areas &ndash; customer service, support serv-
ices and specialist advice &ndash; providing the basis on which to group roles into job families. The
project considered whether to construct families on the basis of function or on the basis of
similarities in the nature of people&rsquo;s work. The latter was chosen as it was believed that this
would help to keep the number of families to a minimum. It was subsequently decided to base
the new structure on 11 job families, each with five levels reflecting the extent of employees&rsquo;
decision-making responsibilities, which range from level 1, where decision making extends
over a few days or weeks to level 5, director level, where strategic decision making involves
tasks with a time span of between one and five years.
<p>Combined career/job-family and broad-banded
structures
<p>It is possible to combine career or job-family structures with broad-banded structures. This
can be done by superimposing a broad-banded structure on career/job families, as illustrated
in Figure 19.11. In effect this means that in each job or career family the levels are restricted to
four or five rather than the more typical seven or eight.
<p>Another approach to the combination of family and broad-banded structures is to divide each
band in a broad-banded structure into job families, as illustrated in Figure 19.12. This enables
internal and external relativities to be dealt with individually for each family and also identifies
career paths within families.</p>

<p>320 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Pay spines
<p>Pay spines are found in the public sector or in agencies and charities that have adopted a
public sector approach to reward management. They consist of a series of incremental &lsquo;pay
points&rsquo; extending from the lowest to the highest-paid jobs covered by the structure, as illus-
trated in Figure 19.13. Typically, pay spine increments are between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
They may be standardized from the top to the bottom of the spine, or the increments may vary
at different levels, sometimes widening towards the top. Job grades are aligned to the pay
spine, and the pay ranges for the grades are defined by the relevant scale of pay points. The
width of grades can vary and job families may have different pay spines. Progression through
a grade is based on service, although an increasing number of organizations provide scope for
accelerating increments or providing additional increments above the top of the scale for the
grade to reward contribution or merit.
<p>Advantages and disadvantages of pay spines
<p>The advantages of pay spines are first that they just about manage themselves. Either no deci-
sions on pay progression have to be made by management and line managers, or decisions on
extra increments, if they are provided for, are made within an explicit framework. Addition-
ally, because the need for managers to make possibly biased or inconsistent judgements on pay
increases does not exist or is severely limited, they give the impression of being fairer than
structures where progression is governed by managerial decisions on performance or contri-
bution. For this reason they are favoured by trade unions and many managements in the
public sector.
<p>&pound;
<p>Figure 19.13 A pay spine</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 321
<p>The disadvantages are that: 1) relating pay almost entirely to service means that people are
rewarded for &lsquo;being there&rsquo; and not for the value of their contribution, 2) pay spines can be
costly in organizations with low staff turnover where everyone drifts to the top of the scale,
and 3) where there are a large number of incremental points in the scale, equal value compli-
cations can arise as men progress to the top while the progress of women is delayed because of
career breaks. For this reason the Local Government Pay Commission recommended a move
away from service-related increments to pay for contribution, restricting increments to the
first few years in a job.
<p>Spot rates
<p>Some organizations do not have a graded structure at all for any jobs, or for certain jobs such
as directors. Instead they use &lsquo;spot rates&rsquo;. These may also be called the &lsquo;rate for the job&rsquo;, more
typically for manual jobs where there is a defined skilled or semi-skilled market rate, which
may be negotiated with a trade union. Spot rates are quite often used in retail firms such as
B&amp;Q for customer service staff (see Chapter 21).
<p>Spot rates are sometimes attached to a person rather than a job. Unless they are negotiated,
rates of pay and therefore relativities are governed by market rates and managerial judgement.
Spot rates are not located within grades and there is no defined scope for progression while on
the spot rate. There may, however, be scope for moving on to higher spot rates as skill, com-
petence or contribution increases. Job holders may be eligible for incentive bonuses on top of
the spot rate.
<p>Spot rates can be used where there is a very simple hierarchy of jobs, as in some manufacturing
and retailing companies. They may be adopted by organizations that want the maximum
amount of scope to pay what they like. They often exist in small or start-up organizations that
do not want to be constrained by a formal grade structure and prefer to retain the maximum
amount of flexibility. But they can result in serious inequities that may be difficult to justify.
<p>Individual job grades
<p>Individual job grades are, in effect, spot rates to which a defined pay range of, say, 20 per cent
on either side of the rate has been attached to provide scope for pay progression based on per-
formance, competence or contribution. Again, the mid-point of the range is fixed by reference
to job evaluation and market rate comparisons.
<p>Individual grades are attached to jobs not persons but there may be more flexibility for move-
ment between grades than in a conventional grade structure. This can arise when people have
expanded their role and it is considered that this growth in the level of responsibility needs to </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>322 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>be recognized without having to upgrade the job. Individual job grades may be restricted to
certain jobs, for example more senior managers, where flexibility in fixing and increasing rates
of pay is felt to be desirable. They provide for greater flexibility than more conventional struc-
tures but can be difficult to manage and justify and can result in pay inequities. As described
earlier in this chapter, the &lsquo;zones&rsquo; that are often established in broad-banded structures have
some of the characteristics of individual job grades.
<p>Choice of grade and pay structures
<p>There is a choice among the different types of structures. Their advantages and disadvantages
are summarized in Table 19.3 and this is followed in Table 19.4 by an assessment of the criteria
for choice of structure.

<p>Table 19.4 Grade and pay structures: criteria for choice
<p>Type of
structure
<p>Criteria for choice &ndash; the structure may be considered more
appropriate when:
<p>Narrow-graded The organization is large and bureaucratic with well defined and &bull;
extended hierarchies.
<p>Pay progression is expected to occur in small but relatively frequent &bull;
steps.
<p>The culture is one in which much significance is attached to status as &bull;
indicated by gradings.
<p>Some but not too much scope for pay progression is wanted. &bull;
<p>Broad-graded It is believed that if there is a relatively limited number of grades it &bull;
will be possible to define and therefore differentiate them more
accurately as an aid to better precision when grading jobs.
<p>An existing narrow-graded structure is the main cause of grade drift. &bull;
It is considered that pay progression through grades can be related to &bull;
contribution and that it is possible to introduce effective control
mechanisms.
<p>Broad-banded Greater flexibility in pay determination and management is required. &bull;
It is believed that job evaluation should no longer drive grading &bull;
decisions.
<p>The focus is on rewarding people for lateral development. &bull;
The organization has been de-layered. &bull;
<p>Career family There are distinct families, and different career paths within and &bull;
between families can be identified and defined.
<p>There is a strong emphasis on career development in the &bull;
organization.
<p>Robust methods of defining competencies exist. &bull;
<p>Job family There are distinct market groups that need to be rewarded differently. &bull;
The range of responsibility and the basis upon which levels exist vary &bull;
between families.
<p>It is believed that career paths need to be defined in terms of &bull;
competence requirements.
<p>Pay spine This is the traditional approach in a public or voluntary sector &bull;
organization and it fits the culture.
<p>It is believed to be impossible to measure different levels of &bull;
contribution fairly and consistently.
<p>Ease of administration is an important consideration. &bull;</p>

<p>Grade and Pay Structures 325
<p>Approaches to the design of the most popular types of structure, namely broad-graded and
career family, are described below.
<p>Developing a grade and pay structure
<p>This section describes how two of the most popular types of structure &ndash; broad-graded and
career family &ndash; can be developed. Whichever structure is selected, there will be a number of
design options. These comprise the number of grades, bands or levels, the width of the grades
(the span of pay ranges), the differentials between grades, the degree to which there should be
overlap between grades, if any, and the method of pay progression within grades. In career-
family structures there are options concerning the number of families, the composition of
families and the basis upon which levels should be defined. The options are summarized in
Table 19.5.
<p>Table 19.5 Grade and pay structure design options

<p>Number of
grades, levels

<p>The range and types of roles to be covered by the structure. &bull;
The range of pay and job evaluation points scores to be &bull;

<p>The number of levels in the organizational hierarchy (this will be an &bull;
important factor in a broad-banded structure).
<p>Decisions on where grade boundaries should be placed following a job &bull;
evaluation exercise that has produced a ranked order of jobs &ndash; this
might identify the existence of clearly defined clusters of jobs at the
various levels in the hierarchy between which there are significant
differences in job size.
<p>The problem of &lsquo;grade drift&rsquo; (unjustified upgradings in response to &bull;
pressure, lack of promotion opportunities or because job evaluation
has been applied laxly), which can be increased if there are too many
narrow grades.
<p>Pay range
spans
<p>Views on the scope that should be allowed for performance, &bull;
contribution or career progression within grade.
<p>Equal pay considerations &ndash; wide spans, especially extended &bull;
incremental scales, are a major cause of pay gaps between men and
women because women, who are more likely to have career breaks
than men, may not have the same opportunity as men to progress to
the upper regions of the range.

<p>326 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>Design feature Design considerations
<p>Differentials
between pay
ranges
<p>Differentials between pay ranges should provide scope to recognize &bull;
increases in job size between successive grades.
<p>If differentials are too close &ndash; less than 10 per cent &ndash; many jobs &bull;
become borderline cases, which can result in a proliferation of appeals
and arguments about grading.
<p>Large differentials below senior management level of more than 25 per &bull;
cent can create problems for marginal or borderline cases because of
the amount at stake.
<p>In most organizations with conventional grade structures a differential &bull;
of between 15 and 20 per cent is appropriate except, perhaps, at the
highest levels.
<p>Pay range
overlap
<p>There is a choice on whether or not pay ranges should overlap and, if &bull;
so, by how much.
<p>Large overlaps of more than 10 per cent can create equal pay problems &bull;
where, as is quite common, men are clustered at the top of their
grades and women are more likely to be found at the lower end.
<p>Pay
progression
<p>There is a choice of methods of pay progression between the various &bull;
forms of contingent pay, namely performance, contribution or
competence-related as described in Chapter 10, and the fixed service-
related increments common in the public sector.
<p>The steps required to design graded and career-family pay structures are described below.
<p>Graded pay structure design
<p>Graded pay structure involves first designing the grade structure and then deciding on the pay
ranges that should be attached to it.
<p>The two approaches to designing the grade structure are: 1) the derived method in which deci-
sions on the grade structure are led by point-factor job evaluation; and 2) the pre-emptive
method in which the number of grades is determined first and each grade is then defined as a
basis for analytical matching or market pricing.
<p>The derived method (use of point-factor job evaluation)
<p>The derived method consists of the following steps:
<p>1. Use point-factor job evaluation to produce a rank order of jobs according to their job
evaluation scores.
<p>Table 19.5 continued</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 327
<p>2. Either (a) take a preliminary view on the preferred number of grades or (b) analyse the
rank order to establish by inspection where jobs might be grouped into grades and how
many grades emerge from this procedure.
<p>3. Decide where the boundaries that will define grades should be placed in the rank order
(guidelines on defining boundaries are given in Figure 19.14).
<p>4. Remember that, so far as possible, the grade boundaries in the rank order should divide
groups or clusters of jobs that are significantly different in size, so that all the jobs placed
in a grade are clearly smaller than the jobs in the next higher grade and larger than the jobs
placed in the next lower grade.
<p>Table 19.6 Method of deciding on grade boundaries
<p>Analyse the rank order to identify any significant gaps in the points scores between
adjacent jobs. These natural breaks in points scores will then constitute the boundaries
between clusters of jobs which can be allocated to adjacent grades. This is the preferred
approach but in many cases there will be no significant gaps. If so, the following method
can be used:
<p>Jobs with common features as indicated by the job evaluation factors are grouped &bull;
together so that a distinction can be made between the characteristics of the jobs in
different grades &ndash; it should be possible to demonstrate that the jobs grouped into one
grade resemble each other more than they resemble jobs placed in adjacent grades.
<p>The grade hierarchy should take account of the organizational hierarchy, ie jobs in &bull;
which the job holder reports to a higher level job holder should be placed in a lower
grade although this principle should not be followed slavishly when an organization is
over-hierarchical with, perhaps, a series of one-over-one reporting relationships.
<p>The boundaries should not be placed between jobs mainly carried out by men and jobs &bull;
mainly carried out by women.
<p>The boundaries should ideally not be placed immediately above jobs in which large &bull;
numbers of people are employed because this will result in a large number of appeals
against the grading.
<p>The grade width in terms of job evaluation points should represent a significant step in &bull;
demands on job holders as indicated by the job evaluation scheme.
<p>The grades in a structure established in this manner can be defined in the form of grade pro-
files using the job evaluation factors as the headings for each profile. These can form the basis
for analytical matching.
<p>Pre-emptive method
<p>The pre-emptive method takes place in the following steps:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>328 Valuing and Grading Jobs
<p>1. Assume number of grades. The assumption on how many grades are required is based on
an analysis of the existing hierarchy of jobs and a judgement on how many levels are
needed to produce a logical grouping of those jobs, level by level. A logical grouping is one
in which each grade contains jobs whose levels are broadly comparable and there is a step
difference in the degree of responsibility between each level.
<p>2. Define grades. There is a choice between a simple non-analytical or semi-analytical job
classification approach and a full analytical approach. The job classification approach
involves preparing an overall definition of the grade to enable &lsquo;job slotting&rsquo; to take place.
This means slotting &lsquo;whole jobs&rsquo;, ie ones that have not been analysed under job evaluation
factor headings, to grades by comparing the whole-job description with grade. A full ana-
lytical approach involves the preparation of grade profiles. These use job evaluation factors
as the headings for the profile of each grade, which can be compared with role profiles set
out under the same headings so that analytical matching can take place.
<p>3. Revise initial assumption as necessary. The process of definition may reveal that the
number of grades assumed to be required initially was either too many (the distinctions
between them cannot be made with sufficient clarity) or too few (it becomes apparent that
the range of jobs to be fitted into the structure is too great to be accommodated into the
number of grades available). If this is the case, the number of grades would have to be
adjusted iteratively until a satisfactory result is obtained.
<p>4. Match benchmark jobs. The benchmark jobs are matched to grades in accordance with a
pre-determined analytical matching protocol, as described in the job evaluation toolkit.
When matched, the information on the benchmark roles may suggest changes to the grade
profiles, which would thus become even more realistic.
<p>5. Match remaining roles. The remaining roles can be matched to the grade profiles using
the protocol. A confirmation of the match can be obtained by comparing them with the
graded benchmark roles.
<p>Pay range design
<p>The steps required to determine pay ranges are:
<p>1. Obtain information on the market rates for benchmark jobs where available. If possible
this should indicate the median rate and the upper and lower quartiles. Remember that
there may be some key jobs for which market rate data is not available.
<p>2. List the jobs within each grade on the basis of job evaluation (these might be limited to
benchmark jobs that have been evaluated but there must be an adequate number of them
if a proper basis for the design is to be provided).
<p>3. Establish the actual rates of pay of the job holders.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Grade and Pay Structures 329
<p>4. For each grade set out the range of pay for job holders and calculate their average or
median rate of pay (the pay practice point). It is helpful to plot this pay practice data as
illustrated in Figure 19.14, which shows pay in each grade against job evaluation scores
and includes a pay practice trend line.
<p>5. Agree policy on how the organization&rsquo;s pay levels should relate to market rates &ndash; its
&lsquo;market stance&rsquo;. This could be at the median, or above the median if it is believed that pay
levels should be more competitive.
<p>6. Calculate the average market rates for the benchmark jobs in each grade according to pay
stance policy, eg the median rates. This produces the range market reference point.

<p>7. Compare the practice and market reference points in each range and decide on the range
reference point. This usually becomes the mid-point of the pay range for the grade and is
regarded as the competitive rate for a fully competent job holder in that grade. This is a
judgemental process that takes into account the difference between the practice and policy
points, the perceived need to be more competitive if policy rates are higher, and the likely
costs of increasing rates.
<p>8. Examine the pay differentials between reference points in adjacent grades. These should
provide scope to recognize increases in job size, and, so far as possible, variations between
differentials should be kept to a minimum. If differentials are too close &ndash; less than 10 per
cent &ndash; many jobs become borderline cases, which can result in a proliferation of appeals
and arguments about grading. Large differentials below senior management level of more
than 25 per cent can create problems for marginal or borderline cases because of the
amount at stake. Experience has shown that in most organizations with conventional
grade structures a differential of between 15 and 20 per cent is appropriate except, perhaps,
at the highest levels.
<p>9. Decide on the range of pay around the reference point. This might be 20 per cent on either
side of the reference point; thus if that point is 100 per cent, the range is from 80 per cent
to 120 per cent. The range can, however, vary in accordance with policy on the scope for
progression and, if a given range of pay has to be covered by the structure, the fewer the
grades the wider the ranges.
<p>10. Decide on the extent, if any, to which pay ranges should overlap. Overlap recognizes that
an experienced job holder at the top of a range may be making a greater contribution than
an inexperienced job holder at the lower end of the range above. Large overlaps of more
than 10 per cent can create equal pay problems where men are at the top of their grades
and women are likely to be found at the lower end.
<p>11. Review the impact of the above pay range decisions on the pay of existing staff in order to
calculate implementation costs. Establish the number of staff whose present rate of pay is
above or below the pay range for the grade into which their jobs have been placed, and the
extent of the difference between the rate of pay of those below the minimum and the
lowest point of that pay range. Calculate the costs of bringing them up to the minimum.
Software such as the pay modellers produced by Link and Pilat or locally tailored Excel
spreadsheets can be used for this purpose.
<p>When the above steps have been completed, it may be necessary to review the decisions made
on the grade structure and pay reference points and ranges, especially when the costs calcu-
lated in Stage 11 are too high. Iteration is almost always necessary to obtain a satisfactory result
that conforms to the criteria for grade and pay structures mentioned earlier and minimizes the
cost of implementation. Alternatives can be modelled using the software mentioned above.</p>

<p>Career-family structure design
<p>The steps required to design a career-family structure are:
<p>1. Select and define career families.
<p> Decide on what career families are required. Typically, not more than four or five families
are identified. The choice of families is between functions, such as marketing or finance,
and activities, such as administration and support staff, or a combination of functions and
activities.
<p>2. Decide on the number of levels in the career-family structure and define them with level
profiles.
<p> Level profiles are required that apply to all the families in the structure, bearing in mind
that the defining characteristic of a career family is that the levels and the pay ranges
attached to them are common to all the families in the structure (as distinct from job-
family structures in which levels and ranges differ between some or all of the families).
<p>3. Identify, define and match benchmark roles.
<p> A representative sample of benchmark roles are identified, defined as role profiles and
matched with the level profiles as described above for a graded structure.
<p>4. Conduct analytical matching.
<p> Analytical matching procedures are used to allocate the remaining roles to levels. It is
advisable to test the process first in one family; this will not only test the procedure but
will also enable model career-family structures to be used when dealing with the other
career families.
<p>5. Attach pay ranges to levels.
<p> Pay ranges are established for each level, as described above for graded structures.
<p>6. Validate relativities between career families.
<p> The allocation of jobs to levels through matching across the career families is validated by
reference to job evaluation scores to ensure that the relativities between them look reason-
able. Some adjustment may need to be made as a result of this cross-check if it exposes
inequities between families.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Probably no aspect of remuneration has attracted as much attention recently as that of the pay
of directors and senior executives, especially since the 2008/09 banking crisis. Searching ques-
tions are being asked frequently about the level of remuneration, the basis upon which pay
decisions are made, the conditions for earning bonuses, and pension arrangements.
<p>This chapter starts with a review of the issues surrounding executive pay: What is the problem?
What are the factors affecting executive pay? Why has it grown so much? Decisions on the pay
of directors and, to a degree, senior executives are influenced by corporate governance consid-
erations and the associated codes, as described in the next part of the chapter. The final section
examines the different aspects of remuneration packages for directors and senior executives,
namely base pay, incentives, benefits and service contracts.
<p>Executive pay levels
<p>According to Duncan Brown (2009), executive pay is out of control. As reported by Seager and
Finch in The Guardian in September 2009, the think tank Compass has established that the
average ratio of chief executive-to-employee pay has risen from 47 to 128 over the past 10
years. A non-executive director interviewed by Perkins and Hendry (2005) during their
research on top pay remarked: &lsquo;There is neither a moral nor a market argument to justify the
explosion in pay, but once started, it is hard to stop. You cannot be seen to be left out.&rsquo;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 337
<p>It has been established by research (Conyon and Leech, 1994; Gomez-Mejia and Balkin, 1992;
Gregg et al 1993) that there is no evidence that the huge increases in pay have resulted in
improved company performance. Timothy Garton Ash (2009) commented that:
<p>The conduct of the bankers who pitched us into the slurry pit &ndash; not all bankers of course,
but quite a few of them &ndash; may not have been illegal but it was selfish, irresponsible and
immoral. Year after year they took huge personal gains for themselves on the basis of
assets whose real nature and prospects they either did not understand or cynically
ignored. Their pay and bonuses, out of all proportion to the sums almost everyone else
was earning in the societies around them, were justified as &lsquo;performance-related&rsquo;, but
&lsquo;performance&rsquo; was measured by inadequate indicators over too short a time-frame.
Remuneration at the top was based on competitive benchmarking against rivals, and
big shots were heard to complain that it was &lsquo;unfair&rsquo; that someone else was earning
&pound;5m a year while they were only earning &pound;4 million a year.
<p>Factors affecting the level and nature of executive
rewards
<p>The five factors are agency theory, tournament theory, market forces, the perceived inherent
value of chief executives and the operation of remuneration committees.
<p>Agency theory
<p>The basic proposition of agency theory is that the only way in which owners (principals) can
get loyalty from their managers (agents) is by paying them more. This is because owners do
not have complete control over their managers and the latter may act in their own interests
and not those of the owners. It is therefore desirable to operate a system of financial incentives
to motivate behaviour and generate results that are in the interests of the owners. This is called
&lsquo;incentive alignment&rsquo;.
<p>Gomez-Mejia et al (2005) suggested that agency theory does not assume opportunism on the
part of the agent, but simply that the agent has self-interest, which can manifest as opportun-
ism under certain conditions. Opportunism is defined as: &lsquo;The adaptation of one&rsquo;s actions to
circumstances in order to further one&rsquo;s immediate interests, without regard for basic princi-
ples or consequences&rsquo;.
<p>According to Perkins and Hendry (2005):
<p>Agency problems arise for investors in assessing whether they are getting the best return
from the executives to whom the firm&rsquo;s management is delegated [who can in effect act </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>338 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>as the dominant stakeholder]. If it were easy to assure alignment between payments
(inputs) to executives and performance (outputs), shareholders could simply pay their
executives a fixed salary (in effect, a form of insurance payment), and then assess
whether that agent is supplying optimal effort in the shareholder&rsquo;s interest. That not
being the case, they resort (according to the theory) to forms of variable performance-
related pay.
<p>It has been suggested by Bruce et al (2005) that this provides rewards for risk-taking.
<p>Tournament theory
<p>Tournament theory explains that the remuneration of a chief executive is in effect a prize and
executives expend effort to increase the likelihood of winning it. As Conyon et al (2001) note,
the theory explains that: &lsquo;Analogous to a sports game, what matters for winning is not the
absolute level of performance, but how well one does in relation to the other competitors.&rsquo; The
effect is that the relationship between organizational and pay levels is convex, with a consider-
ably greater gap between the next-to-highest and the highest levels.
<p>Market forces
<p>The way market forces work in executive pay tends to be through &lsquo;comparisons with other
executives in relevant industry labour markets&rsquo; (Stiles and Taylor, 2002). Thus, the Hampel
Report (1998) stated that British boardroom remuneration will be &lsquo;largely determined by the
market&rsquo;, although the earlier Greenbury Report (1995) argued that the market was imperfect
and only set a broad framework.
<p>Data collected by Perkins and Hendry (2005) over 10 years for 81 of the FTSE 100 companies
tended to show a relative lack of intra-company movement among executive directors, in par-
ticular internationally. This, they commented, undermines the presumption of a market in
executives and hence in executive pay. They went on to point out that: &lsquo;While the evidence for
a market with price as a clearing mechanism remains questionable, therefore, there is certainly
no widespread subjective sense of such a market among those who are closest to it. Rather,
there are a series of localized bargains.&rsquo; They quoted a remuneration committee member they
interviewed who categorically denied the existence of a recognizable market for executives,
&lsquo;certainly not like that for beef or shares&rsquo;. Instead, he said, there are &lsquo;just key people in unique
positions at a given moment in time, who are not readily interchangeable&rsquo;.</p>
<br>

<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 339
<p>The perceived inherent value of chief executives
<p>The price of chief executives may be influenced by beliefs in their value to the business as the
generators of shareholder value. But as Perkins and Hendry (2005) wrote presciently: &lsquo;There
is more spectacular evidence that misjudged CEO and board decisions contribute far more to
destroying value than creating it (for example, GEC/Marconi, to name but one case).&rsquo; Later
events, notably crises in a number of banks largely due to the activities of their chief executives,
have proved them right.
<p>Remuneration committees
<p>The Committee on Corporate Governance (2000) of the Stock Exchange and other reports
recommended the establishment of remuneration committees to provide an independent
basis for setting the salary levels and the rules covering incentives, share options, benefit enti-
tlements and contract provisions for executive directors. Such committees were to be account-
able to shareholders for the decisions they take and the non-executive directors who sat on
them would have no personal financial interests at stake. They would be constituted as sub-
committees of company boards, and boards should elect both the chairman and the members.
Their essential role would be to set broad policy for executive remuneration as a whole as well
as the remuneration packages of executive directors and, sometimes, other senior executives.
They should consist exclusively of non-executive directors and should determine remunera-
tion policy and the reward packages of individual executive directors, which should appear as
a section in the annual report. This report should include statements on remuneration policy
and the methods used to form that policy and disclose details of the remuneration of individ-
ual directors. The Combined Code of Practice (see later in this chapter) laid down the princi-
ples they should take into account when considering pay levels.
<p>Remuneration committees are now well established as bodies for making recommendations
on directors&rsquo; pay, often with the advice of remuneration consultants. The Combined Code
states that they should avoid paying more than is necessary, and should also be sensitive to pay
and employment conditions elsewhere in the group, especially when determining annual
salary increases. But the extent to which they follow either of these precepts is often question-
able. So is the degree to which they are independent; after all, members of the remuneration
committee are also colleagues of the board members on whose remuneration they deliberate.
<p>As Perkins and Hendry (2005) observed following their discussions with remuneration commit-
tee members, consultants engaged by managements to &lsquo;advise&rsquo; committees were felt to be
encouraging a &lsquo;pernicious process of choosing comparators&rsquo; that &lsquo;just leads to the ratcheting up
of top pay&hellip; The problem becomes particularly acute when companies all strive to achieve the
statistically impossible feat of setting reward levels to locate themselves in the upper quartile of
their benchmark group.&rsquo; They also noted the ambiguities and weaknesses of the non-executive </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>340 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>directors and commented that: &lsquo;The workings of a market in executive pay are fatally under-
mined by the social realities.&rsquo;
<p>Why has executive pay grown so much?
<p>The reasons for the growth in executive rewards as explained by Dymond and Murlis (2009)
are:
<p>Agency theory: shareholders must structure the CEO&rsquo;s compensation arrangements to &bull;
reward behaviours that increase shareholder wealth (this is the most important
reason).
<p>Tournament theory: the high rewards received by CEOs have little to do with what they &bull;
deserve. Rather the main purpose of such rewards is to send signals to senior managers
to motivate them to compete for the number one spot.
<p>The changing nature of companies and the increasing demands made on chief &bull;
executives.
<p>Star culture: the creation of the celebrity CEO. &bull;
<p>The talent shortage. &bull;
<p>Pay disclosure in annual reports lead to demands from CEOs to achieve parity. Hampel &bull;
(1998) noted that a perverse outcome of the requirements for greater disclosure of
directors&rsquo; pay and the administration of salary surveys was to help &lsquo;ratchet up&rsquo; pay
levels among full-time board members.
<p>To which could be added the ways in which remuneration committees can sometimes func-
tion as conduits for pay increases, aided and abetted by remuneration consultants.
<p>Corporate governance and executive remuneration
<p>Corporate governance is the internal set of processes and policies that determine the way a
corporation is directed and controlled, and serve the needs of shareholders and other stake-
holders. It involves the board of a company and includes how members of that board are
remunerated.
<p>It is usually assumed that a company is owned by its shareholders and that the prime, if not the
only responsibility, of its management (ie the board) is to increase the value of the shares
owned by shareholders &ndash; shareholder value. But, as Simon Caulkin (2009) noted: &lsquo;Contrary to
common assumptions, shareholders do not own companies (how could they and benefit from
limited liability at the same time?), and directors owing their duty to the company can&rsquo;t be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 341
<p>&ldquo;agents&rdquo; of shareholders &ndash; indeed they are charged with acting fairly as between all company
members.&rsquo; As reported by Caulkin, Professor Bob Garret recently told a meeting of the Human
Capital Forum that the first duty of directors was not to shareholders but to the company
itself: &lsquo;Organizations have to move from agency theory to stewardship theory.&rsquo; The latter is the
theory that managers, left on their own, will act as responsible stewards of the assets they
control on behalf of all stakeholders. This may not necessarily happen in reality, but as an aspi-
ration has more to offer than agency theory.
<p>It follows that focusing only on increasing shareholder value is a questionable approach.
Caulkin quotes Jack Welch, formerly head of GE and the foremost management icon of the
age, as saying that shareholder value &lsquo;is the dumbest idea in the world &ndash; a result not a strategy
&ndash; your main constituents are your employees, customers and products&rsquo;.
<p>The Combined Code on Corporate Governance
<p>Corporations may or may not pursue shareholder value at the expense of good corporate gov-
ernance or stewardship, but their role in general and their specific role in deciding on remu-
neration arrangements for directors has been questioned regularly since 1992 when the
Cadbury committee reported. This was followed by a report from the Greenbury Committee
(1995) and the Hampel Report (1998). These led to The Combined Code on Corporate Gov-
ernance produced by the Financial Reporting Council in 2008, which lays down general prin-
ciples of governance and a number of specific principles relating to the remuneration of
directors. These are:
<p>Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of &bull;
the quality required to run the company successfully, but a company should avoid
paying more than is necessary for this purpose. A significant proportion of executive
directors&rsquo; remuneration should be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and
individual performance.
<p>The remuneration committee should judge where to position their company relative to &bull;
other companies. But they should use such comparisons with caution, in view of the
risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement
in performance. They should also be sensitive to pay and employment conditions else-

<p>The performance-related elements of remuneration should form a significant propor- &bull;
tion of the total remuneration package of executive directors and should be designed
to align their interests with those of shareholders and to give these directors keen incen-
tives to perform at the highest levels.
<p>The remuneration committee should consider whether the directors should be eligible &bull;
for annual bonuses. If so, performance conditions should be relevant, stretching and </p>

<p>designed to enhance shareholder value. Upper limits should be set and disclosed. There
may be a case for part payment in shares to be held for a significant period.
<p>Payouts or grants under all incentive schemes, including new grants under existing &bull;
share option schemes, should be subject to challenging performance criteria that
reflect the company&rsquo;s objectives. The total rewards potentially available should not
be excessive.
<p>The remuneration committee should consider the pension consequences and associ- &bull;
ated costs to the company of basic salary increases and any other changes in pension-
able remuneration, especially for directors close to retirement.
<p>But it seems that these principles are frequently more honoured in the breach than in the
observance.
<p>The Turner Review
<p>The banking crisis of 2008 prompted the Turner Review, which proposed the following code
of good practice:
<p>Firms must ensure that their remuneration policies are consistent with effective risk &bull;
management.
<p>Remuneration should reflect an individual&rsquo;s record of compliance with risk man- &bull;
agement procedures, rules and appropriate culture, as well as financial measures of
performance.
<p>Financial measures used in remuneration policies should entail the adjustment of &bull;
profit measures to reflect the relative riskiness of different activities.
<p>The predominant share (two-thirds or more) of bonuses that exceed a significant level, &bull;
should be paid in a deferred form (deferred cash or shares), with a deferral period that
is appropriate to the nature of the business and its risks.
<p>Payment of deferred bonuses should be linked to financial performance during the &bull;
deferral period.
<p>Directors&rsquo; and senior executives&rsquo; remuneration
<p>The main elements of directors&rsquo; and senior executives&rsquo; remuneration are basic pay, short and
long-term bonus or incentive schemes, share option and share ownership schemes, benefits
and service contracts. The salary is usually a one-off, negotiated rate and commonly incorpo-
rates a golden hello or pay-off deal. It should be set through a remuneration committee that
meets good practice guidelines.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 343
<p>Basic pay
<p>Decisions on the base salary of directors and senior executives are usually founded on views
about the market worth of the individuals concerned. Remuneration on joining the company
is commonly settled by negotiation, often subject to the approval of a remuneration commit-
tee. Reviews of base salaries are then undertaken by reference to market movements and
success as measured by company performance. Decisions on base salary are important not
only in themselves but also because the level may influence decisions on the pay of both senior
and middle managers. Bonuses are expressed as a percentage of base salary, share options may
be allocated as a declared multiple of basic pay and, commonly, pension will be a generous
proportion of final salary.
<p>Bonus schemes
<p>Virtually all major employers in the UK (90 per cent according to recent surveys by organiza-
tions such as Monks and Hay) have annual incentive (bonus) schemes for senior executives.
Bonus schemes provide directors and executives with cash sums based on the measures of
company and, frequently, individual performance.
<p>Typically, bonus payments are linked to achievement of profit and/or other financial targets
and they are sometimes &lsquo;capped&rsquo;; that is, a restriction is placed on the maximum amount
payable. There may also be elements related to achieving specific goals and to individual
performance. Bonuses tend to be high &ndash; 70 per cent of base salary or more. They are osten-
sibly intended to motivate directors to achieve performance improvements for the business.
A more common although not always disclosed reason for bonuses is to ensure that what is
believed to be a competitive remuneration package is available: &lsquo;Everyone else is doing it so
we must too.&rsquo;
<p>One of the problems with high bonus expectations is that of the &lsquo;moral hazard&rsquo; involved. For
example, directors might be tempted to manipulate reported profits to drive up the share
price, frequently an important determinant of bonuses. Or they may go for high returns in
risky short-term projects, ignoring the possible downside of longer-term losses.
<p>Long-term bonuses
<p>Cash bonus schemes can be extended over periods of more than one year on the grounds that
annual bonuses focus too much on short-term results. The most common approach to pro-
viding longer-term rewards is through share ownership schemes as described later.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>344 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Deferred bonus schemes
<p>Some companies have adopted deferred bonus schemes under which part of the executive&rsquo;s
annual bonus is deferred for, say, two years. The deferred element is converted into shares,
each of which is matched with an extra, free share on condition the executive remains employed
by the company at the end of the deferral period. Such a scheme is designed to reward per-
formance and loyalty to the company.
<p>Scheme effectiveness
<p>In an effective bonus scheme:
<p>Targets will be tough but achievable. &bull;
<p>The reward should be commensurate with the achievement. &bull;
<p>The targets will be quantified and agreed. &bull;
<p>The measures used will refer to the key factors that affect company performance, and &bull;
these performance areas will be those that can be directly affected by the efforts of those
eligible for bonus payments.
<p>The formula will be simple and clear. &bull;
<p>On the evidence of recent bonus pay-outs to failing company directors, it does not seem that
these criteria are being applied successfully.
<p>Share option schemes
<p>Many companies have share option schemes that give directors and executives the right to buy
a block of shares on some future date at the share price ruling when the option was granted.
They are a form of long-term incentive on the assumption that executives will be motivated to
perform more effectively if they can anticipate a substantial capital gain when they sell their
shares at a price above that prevailing when they took up the option.
<p>Conditions may be laid down to the effect that the company&rsquo;s earnings per share (EPS) growth
should exceed inflation by a set amount over a number of years (often three) and that the
executive remains employed by the company at the exercise date.
<p>The arguments advanced in favour of executive share options are that, first, it is right for exec-
utives to share in the success of their company to which, it is assumed, they have contributed
and, second, they encourage executives to align their interests (incentive alignment) more
closely in the longer term with those of the shareholders as a whole (the latter argument is
based on agency theory although it is quite possible that those who advance it are unaware that
such a thing as agency theory exists). The first point is valid as long as the reward for exercising </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Directors and Senior Executives 345
<p>share options is commensurate with the contribution of the executive to the improved per-
formance of the business. The second point is dubious. The vast majority of shares acquired in
this way are sold almost immediately and the gain is pocketed as extra income.
<p>Share options have been severely criticized recently because of the enormous gains made by
some executives. There is a strong feeling among the major investment institutions that share
options do not achieve community of interest between executives and shareholders and are in
effect no more than a form of cash bonus in which the pay-out has little or nothing to do with
the executive&rsquo;s performance, and indeed can become a reward for failure.
<p>Performance share schemes
<p>Some companies have performance share schemes under which executives are provisionally
awarded shares. The release of the shares is subject to the company&rsquo;s performance, typically
determined on a sliding scale by reference to the company&rsquo;s total shareholder return (a com-
bination of share price growth and dividend yield) ranking against its chosen peer companies
over a three-year period. Release is also conditional on the executive remaining employed by
the company at the vesting date. Such a scheme rewards loyalty to the company and the value
delivered to shareholders in the form of share price performance and dividends but does not
link directly to business performance.
<p>Executive restricted share schemes
<p>Under such schemes free shares are provisionally awarded to participants. These shares do not
belong to the executive until they are released or vested; hence they are &lsquo;restricted&rsquo;. The number
of shares actually released to the executive at the end of a defined period (usually three or, less
commonly, five years) will depend on performance over that period against specific targets.
Thereafter there may be a further retention period when the shares must be held although no
further performance conditions apply.
<p>Benefits
<p>Employee benefits for executives may amount to over 20 per cent of the total reward package.
The most important element is the pension scheme, and directors may be provided with a
much higher accrual rate than in a typical final salary scheme. This means that, typically, the
maximum two-thirds pension can be achieved after 20 years&rsquo; service or even less, rather than
the 40 years it takes in a typical one-sixtieth scheme. Pensions are easily inflated, as in a recent
notorious case, by presenting the departing director with a last-minute substantial increase in
pensionable salary.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>346 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Service contracts
<p>Long-term service contracts for directors have been fairly typical, but they are disliked in the
City because of the high severance payments to departing chief executives and directors that
are made if the contract is two or three years, even when it was suspected or actually the case
that they had been voted off the board because of inadequate performance. Rolling contracts
for directors are now more likely to be restricted to one year.
<p>Rewarding directors: six tips
Follow the principles of corporate governance laid down by the Combined &bull;
Code.
<p>Make decisions on levels of remuneration by reference to objective evidence, &bull;
not hearsay or assumptions.
<p>Justify rates of pay on the basis of the performance of the chief executive or &bull;
director, as demonstrated by the performance of the business.
<p>Ensure that members of the remuneration committee are properly briefed and &bull;
supported in making their recommendations.
<p>Subject all bonus plans to careful scrutiny to ensure that they conform to good &bull;
practice.
<p>Subject proposed bonus payments to rigorous scrutiny to ensure that they &bull;
genuinely reflect the level of performance achieved and do not reward failure.

Rewarding Sales and
<p>Customer Service Staff
<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should know about:
<p>Methods of rewarding sales staff &bull; Methods of rewarding customer service &bull;
staff
<p>Introduction
<p>Sales and customer service staff make a strong and immediate impact on business results. This
has led to an emphasis on financial incentives, especially for sales representatives and sales staff
in retailers, who are often treated quite differently from other people. The reward system for
sales and service staff also has to take account of the fact that they are the people who are in
direct contact with customers, and this also applies to people in call centres.
<p>Rewarding sales representatives
<p>Sales representatives are more likely to be eligible for commission payments or bonuses
than other staff on the grounds that their sales performance will depend on or at least be
improved by financial incentives. Many companies believe that the special nature of selling
and the type of person they need to attract to their sales force requires some form of addi-
tional bonus or commission to be paid. The nature of the work of sales representatives
means that it is usually easy to specify targets and measure performance against them, and
sales incentive schemes are therefore more likely to meet the line of sight requirement (ie
that there should be a clear link between effort and performance) than schemes for other
<p>348 </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Sales and Customer Service Staff 349
<p>staff such as managers and administrators. Sales staff, including those in retail establish-
ments, are often paid spot rates with a commission on sales.
<p>Financial methods of rewarding sales staff
<p>The approaches to rewarding sales staff described below are:
<p>salary only; &bull;
<p>basic salary plus commission; &bull;
<p>basic salary plus bonus; &bull;
<p>commission only. &bull;
<p>Table 21.1 summarizes the different schemes, their advantages and disadvantages and when
they may be appropriate.
<p>Salary only
<p>Companies may adopt a salary only (no commission or bonus) approach when sales staff have
little influence over sales volume, when representing the company and generally promoting its
products or services is more important than direct selling, and when the company wants to
encourage sales staff to build up good and long-term relationships with their customers, the
emphasis being on customer service rather than on high-pressure selling.
<p>Basic salary only may also be paid to sales staff who work in highly seasonal industries where
sales fluctuate considerably, and businesses where regular orders for food and other consumer
goods give little opportunity for creative selling.
<p>However, companies that do not pay commission or bonus may have a pay-for-contribu-
tion scheme that provides for consolidated increases based on an assessment of perform-
ance and competence in such areas as teamwork, customer relations, interpersonal skills
and communications. Where sales staff have to work together to achieve results or where it
is difficult to apportion a successful sale to individuals, a team pay approach may be adopted.
Additionally, salary-only sales representatives may be eligible for incentives in the form of
prizes as described later.
<p>If no commission or bonus is offered, it is necessary for companies to ensure that the salaries
paid to their sales staff are competitive. They have to take account of the total earnings of sales
staff in markets from which they recruit people or where their own staff move. If they cannot
or do not want to at least match these earnings they may have to offer other inducements to
join or stay with the company. These can include opportunities for promotion, learning new
skills, more stable pay and greater security.</p>

<p>352 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Basic salary plus commission
<p>Salary plus commission plans provide for a proportion of total earnings to be paid in commis-
sion, while the rest is paid in the form of a fixed salary. The commission is calculated as a per-
centage of the value of sales. The proportion of commission varies widely. As a general rule it
is higher when results depend on the ability and effort of individuals or when there is less
emphasis on non-selling activities. As a rule of thumb, most sales managers believe that the
commission element will not motivate their staff unless they have a reasonable opportunity to
earn at least 20 per cent of base pay.
<p>The commission may be a fixed percentage of all sales, possibly with a &lsquo;cap&rsquo; or upper limit on
earnings. Alternatively the commission rate can increase at higher levels of sales on a rising
scale to encourage sales representatives to make even greater efforts.
<p>Basic salary plus bonus
<p>Cash bonuses may be paid on top of basic salary. They are based on the achievement of targets
or quotas for sales volume, profit or sales &lsquo;contribution&rsquo; (sales revenue minus variable
expenses). They differ from commission payments in that the latter are based simply on a per-
centage of whatever sales have been attained. In a bonus scheme, targets or objectives may be
set just for sales volume but they can also focus on particular aspects of the results that can be
achieved by sales staff that it is felt should be stimulated. These may include the sales of high-
margin or more profitable products or services in order to encourage staff to concentrate on
them rather than simply aiming to achieve sales volume with low-margin products that are
easier to sell. They may also cover reviving moribund accounts, promoting new products and
minimizing bad debt. Other criteria may include the level of customer service, the volume of
repeat business, the number of productive calls made, product knowledge, teamwork and
quality of administration.
<p>There are many ways in which bonuses can be determined. The method used will take into
account the following considerations:
<p>The formula for relating bonuses to sales: a bonus may be triggered when a sales thresh- &bull;
old is reached, with additions related to increased sales directly or on an accelerated
basis.
<p>The size of bonus payments available at different levels of performance. &bull;
<p>The maximum bonus that will be paid out. &bull;
<p>The bonus criteria: sales revenue is often used, but some companies use profit or con- &bull;
tribution to encourage sales representatives to focus on selling high-margin products
rather than going for volume.
<p>Any other factors to be included in the bonus plan such as those mentioned above. &bull;</p>

<p>Rewarding Sales and Customer Service Staff 353
<p>Commission only
<p>Sales staff who are at the &lsquo;hard&rsquo; end of selling (eg double glazing) may only receive a straight
commission based on a percentage of the value of their sales. No basic salary is paid.
<p>Additional non-cash rewards
<p>While it is possible that the prime motivator for a typical sales representative is cash, there are
a number of other effective non-cash ways of providing motivation as described below.
<p>Other means of rewarding sales representatives
<p>Financial rewards are usually important for members of the sales force but there are other
valuable means of recognizing achievement. These include prizes and non-financial forms of
recognition (&lsquo;sales representative of the month&rsquo; etc) and other items in the total reward package
such as opportunities for growth. As pointed out by Gundy (2002):
<p>In assessing how to motivate the sales force, leading companies view commissions
and bonuses as just one tool in the motivational toolbox&hellip; Performance manage-
ment, career pathing and recognition programmes can be powerful ways of produc-
ing and managing sales results. Companies that consider the impact of all these
programmes in the design process are generally more successful in driving both short-
and long-term results.
<p>Other forms of reward are described below.
<p>Gifts and vouchers
<p>Gifts and vouchers provide a tangible means of recognizing achievements. They may be linked
to the achievement of specified targets but should not be restricted too much to the &lsquo;super
sales representatives&rsquo;; the solid dependable salesperson also needs motivating through the rec-
ognition that such incentives provide. Gifts are subject to income tax.
<p>Competitions
<p>Prizes can be awarded to individuals or teams for notable sales achievements, such as bringing
in new business. However, competitions can demotivate those who do not win prizes and they
should be designed to ensure that all those who are doing well feel that they have a good
chance of getting a prize.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>354 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Cars as perks
<p>Sales representatives can be motivated by the opportunity to get a bigger and better car if they
are particularly successful. The car may be retained for a defined period and made available
again if the high performance is maintained.
<p>Recognition schemes
<p>Recognition schemes, as described in Chapter 14, are particularly appropriate for sales staff.
Public applause and private thanks are both important.
<p>Effectiveness and use of sales incentives
<p>A survey of the effectiveness of incentive plans by Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2004)
established that: &lsquo;Many organizations feel their plans do not encourage or reward the right
performance. Of equal concern is that many staff do not understand the plan.&rsquo; The survey
found that:
<p>17 per cent of respondents had between five and eight separate reward criteria. &bull;
<p>3 per cent used nine or more performance measures. &bull;
<p>Volume production targets such as sales revenue, gross profit or units sold were the &bull;
most used.
<p>72 per cent used profit targets for sales directors, along with revenue measures in 64 per &bull;
cent of organizations and individual objectives in 60 per cent.
<p>For sales representatives the most widely used measure was sales volume (72 per cent &bull;
of schemes).
<p>Rewarding customer service staff
<p>Customer service staff work mainly in retail establishments and in call or customer contact
centres. Their rewards need to reflect the nature of their duties, ie enhancing levels of cus-
tomer service as well as selling.
<p>Reward practices
<p>The CIPD in conjunction with the Institute of Customer Service commissioned Professor
Michael West and a team from Aston University to investigate how customer service staff were
employed and rewarded (West et al, 2005).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Sales and Customer Service Staff 355
<p>The 580 staff covered by the research illustrated that front-line customer service workers do
not all conform to the young/female/fleeting image. While 70 per cent were women, their
average age was 34 years and average length of service six years. Eighty per cent were employed
on a full-time basis and just 9 per cent on temporary contracts.
<p>Nor did their typical working environment and conditions reflect the stereotypical &lsquo;sweat-
shop&rsquo; image. While the HR and reward practices varied, working conditions were generally
good and staff rated their supervisors&rsquo; skills, as well as their colleagues and the level of team-
working. Staff benefits such as company pension plans and sick pay schemes were the norm,
as were various training courses.
<p>The pattern of pay practices used by these 15 organizations for front-line staff and their first-
line managers is shown in Table 21.2. Base pay levels were generally competitive for the loca-
tion and sector, and a number mentioned the effect of the national minimum wage.

<p>356 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Most employees in the researched organizations had the opportunity to progress their base
pay on the basis of their performance or competence, either through a range or up a pay spine,
or between grades/levels of job. Such arrangements have generally supplanted &lsquo;spot&rsquo; rate pay
rates for service roles in call centres and retail shops.
<p>At Boots the Chemists, for example, shop staff can progress up through a number of pay points
according to their level of performance and skill &ndash; from entry level, to experienced, to advanced,
to expert/specialist. At B&amp;Q, customer advisors are paid on one of six different spot rates. Pay
progression is based on the acquisition &ndash; and application on the shopfloor &ndash; of skills and
knowledge. There are four additional spot rates beyond the established rate designed to reward
&lsquo;excellence in the role&rsquo;. Each additional level represents an hourly increase up to a maximum
rate. At House of Fraser, employees are allocated to one of four competency bands &ndash; training,
bronze, silver and gold &ndash; with staff assessed for a &lsquo;promotion&rsquo; every six months. At Lands&rsquo; End,
there is a six-grade pay structure for hourly-paid staff, with spot rates for starters.
<p>Low base pay/high commission arrangements were rare amongst the 15 organizations, but
most of them operated variable performance-related pay schemes of some type, which again
has become the norm for service staff today in these contexts, at least in the private sector.
Tesco and John Lewis staff, for example, received company-wide profit sharing payments.
British Gas uses a company-wide balanced scorecard bonus scheme, while Homebase, Asda
and Marks and Spencer use team, store-based schemes. A number of the organizations used
multiple plans.
<p>All forms of performance-related pay and recognition schemes were used more frequently and
more extensively by the highest-performing organizations in the research than amongst the
other participants or amongst UK organizations as a whole. They were twice as likely as other
UK organizations to use individual performance-related pay and various forms of individual
and team non-financial recognition schemes, and five times as likely to use some form of
team/collective bonus scheme as the remaining organizations in the study.
<p>Reward policies in the research study organizations did not by themselves create high cus-
tomer service performance. They operated through the medium of staff perceptions and in a
general work and management context that encouraged positive perceptions and high levels
of staff commitment &ndash; see Figure 21.1. The best organizations recognize that when it comes to
delivering outstanding service, staff perceptions and management practice, rather than fancy
reward and HR strategy statements, plans and policies are what make the difference.</p>

<p>Rewarding sales and service staff: six tips
Analyse the business in terms of what is being sold or what customer services &bull;
are provided to establish what types of people are required.
<p>Select the approach to reward that is most likely to motivate the different types &bull;
of people to deliver results in accordance with the business model.
<p>Identify critical selling and customer service behaviours and capabilities and &bull;
reinforce them through the reward package.
<p>Determine the optimum mix of base pay and incentive pay based on selling or &bull;
service requirements. An emphasis on customer relations may suggest more
base pay and less incentive pay (even no incentive at all and a competitive base

incentive.

<p>What motivates knowledge workers &bull; Approaches to rewarding knowledge &bull;
workers
<p>Introduction
<p>A knowledge worker was originally defined by Peter Drucker (1988) as someone &lsquo;who knows
more about his or her work than anyone else in the organization&rsquo;. Today, knowledge workers
are generally regarded as people whose work requires a marked degree of expertise. Their work
is defined by the knowledge they need to do it. The term therefore embraces such diverse
groups as academics, accountants, HR professionals, IT specialists, lawyers, media workers
and researchers.

<p>Knowledge workers play a steadily increasing part in organizations. According to the gov-
ernment&rsquo;s Occupational Employment Trends and Projections, UK 1982&ndash;2012, by 2012
knowledge workers will have increased from roughly a quarter of all jobs 20 years ago to
almost a half.
<p>The importance of the contribution made by knowledge workers means that attention has to
be given to how reward policies and practices can be developed to attract, retain and motivate
them having taken account of their particular needs. This is an area of reward management
where segmentation may be appropriate. For example, the fluid grading system used in the
scientific civil service allows for much more flexibility in rewarding scientists in line with their
levels of competence rather than by the levels of responsibility that characterize traditional
narrow-graded structures. The requirement to consider how knowledge workers should be
rewarded is studied in this chapter, which starts with an analysis of what motivates them and
then examines the approaches that can be adopted to their rewards.
<p>What motivates knowledge workers?
<p>In the words of Reeves and Knell (2001), it can be said of all knowledge workers that: &lsquo;The
brightest and the best want an intellectual challenge and the chance to keep learning.&rsquo; And
Coyle (2001) explains that: &lsquo;Skilled programmers don&rsquo;t seem to fret about getting enough
money. The more highly valued reward, because it is so much harder to come by, is the esteem
in which they are held by their peer group.&rsquo;
<p>A study by Tampoe (1993) identified four key motivators for knowledge workers:
<p>Personal growth: the opportunity for individuals to fully realize their potential. &bull;
<p>Occupational autonomy: a work environment in which knowledge workers can achieve &bull;
the task assigned to them.
<p>Task achievement: a sense of accomplishment from producing work that is of high &bull;
quality and relevance to the organization.
<p>Money rewards: an income that is a just reward for their contribution to corporate &bull;
success and that symbolizes their contribution to that success.
<p>To which could be added, especially for scientific or research and development workers, the
facilities required to carry out their work and the opportunity to gain recognition and prestige
from their achievements. These may be more significant than financial rewards relating pay to
performance.</p>

<p>Rewarding Knowledge Workers 361
<p>Approaches to rewarding knowledge workers
<p>Approaches to rewarding knowledge workers are described below under the headings of total
reward, pay flexibility, pay related to competency, and career and job-family structures.
<p>Total reward policies
<p>Taking into account the factors that motivate knowledge workers mentioned above, there is
an overwhelming case for adopting a total reward policy. As explained in Chapter 3, this would
mean focusing on non-financial rewards such as recognition, opportunity to grow and achieve,
and learning and development opportunities as well as financial rewards.
<p>The following are examples of the approach used by two firms employing large numbers of
knowledge workers.
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb
<p>The pharmaceutical company states that &lsquo;reward is much wider than just paying its staff a
competitive salary.&rsquo; It has designed its total reward package knowing that everyone works for
the company for different reasons and that everyone places a different emphasis on the impor-
tance of each of the elements of total reward &ndash; there is no one-size-fits-all. It has also set out to
use total reward to &lsquo;elevate and differentiate&rsquo; Bristol-Myers Squibb from other companies,
both in the same industry and beyond.
<p>The three elements of total reward are:
<p>Compensation: salary, performance-based bonus and stock options. &bull;
<p>Benefits: non-contributory pension, life cover, private health care, perks and cars. &bull;
<p>Work experience: defined as: &lsquo;All the elements which contribute to providing you with &bull;
an environment that enables you to optimize your contribution to the company and
achieve your full potential, whilst maintaining a balance between your personal and
professional life&rsquo;. These include:
<p>acknowledgement, appreciation and recognition; &ndash;
<p>balance of work and life; &ndash;
<p>culture of Bristol-Myers Squibb; &ndash;
<p>employee development; &ndash;
<p>the working environment. &ndash;
<p>The total reward approach at Bristol-Myers Squibb embraces what they call the &lsquo;work
experience&rsquo;, described above. This, says the company, to its staff &lsquo;recognizes that you are </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>362 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>an individual with unique needs and offers something for everyone&rsquo;. Work experience
comprises acknowledgement, appreciation and recognition, balance of work and life,
organizational culture, employee development and the working environment.
<p>Elan Computers
<p>The company&rsquo;s approach to total reward stresses investment in people, recognition, the quality
of life and fair and competitive reward. It is part of Elan&rsquo;s people strategy, the stated aims of
which are to:
<p>Support the group vision, to invest in talented people, and to maintain a people-focused
environment that is fun, challenging and rewarding. Starting with our comprehensive
induction programme, we aim to secure long term commitment and inspire enthusi-
asm from day one. And we never stop listening to people. People are given the opportu-
nity every year to take part in a survey to give feedback on every aspect of their life at
Elan, and there are open question and answer sessions with board members. And to
ensure that we are doing what we can to keep the best people, we study the reasons why
people leave, and what retains our most talented people. This strategy allows us to con-
tinually improve our position as an employer and as a market force.
<p>The complete package, the concept of which is based on employees understanding the total
value of all the rewards they receive, not just the individual elements, is designed to attract,
retain, motivate and develop the best talent. The proposition for employees is that &lsquo;TotalRe-
ward&rsquo; gives them the opportunity to share in the company&rsquo;s success, makes it easier to balance
home and working life, and helps them to take care of themselves and their families.
<p>Pay flexibility
<p>The overall approach to rewarding knowledge workers should be flexibility within a frame-
work. This means that a common framework of reward policies exists across the organization
but within that framework some segmentation, as described in Chapter 28, can take place.
This would involve tailoring arrangements to suit the specific needs of particular groups of
knowledge and professional workers and the individuals within those groups. Pay flexibility
could include market rate supplements to attract and retain specific categories of staff and the
use of selected &lsquo;market groups&rsquo; (separate pay structures for certain types of staff). This is in
accord with the view expressed by Lawler (2002) that there should be a move away from job-
based pay to person-based pay related to the market value of a person&rsquo;s skills and knowledge.
On a wider scale, career or job families can be installed as described in Chapter 19.</p>

<br>
<p>Rewarding Knowledge Workers 363
<p>Pay related to competency
<p>If knowledge workers exist to apply their expertise then it seems reasonable to reward them
according to the level of expertise (competency) they possess and apply. There are three ways
of doing this, as described below: 1) by competency-related pay, 2) through structures in
which grades or bands are defined in competency terms, and 3) the incorporation of skills and
competencies into job evaluation factor plans.
<p>Competency-related pay
<p>In a competency-related pay scheme, people receive financial rewards in the shape of increases
to their base pay by reference to the level of competence they demonstrate in carrying out their
roles. It is a method of paying people for the ability to perform now and in the future. This
seems to be a highly relevant approach for knowledge workers but there are measurement
problems that have restricted its use.
<p>Competency defined grade and pay structures
<p>Job or career family structures typically define levels in terms of competencies.
<p>Use of competencies in job evaluation
<p>Traditional job evaluation schemes have always incorporated competencies in their factor
plans, although they called them knowledge, skill or know-how. Factor plans have recently
been developed that deliberately include competencies. This has applied in sectors or organi-
zations such as higher education (the HERA scheme), the senior civil service (the JESP system)
and the NHS, where there are 16 measurement factors but the knowledge, skills and experi-
ence factor accounts for almost a quarter of the total points weighting. This scheme acknowl-
edges the explicit bias towards knowledge in an organization with huge numbers of professional
workers.
<p>Job and career families
<p>Job and career-family structures as described in Chapter 19 consist of separate families of jobs
with similar characteristics. Within each family the successive levels of competency required
to carry out typical activities are defined, thus indicating career paths. In a job-family structure
such as that at Canon UK or Norwich Union Insurance, each job family has its own pay struc-
ture, which takes account of different levels of market rates between families (this is some-
times called &lsquo;market grouping&rsquo;). In a career-family structure as at Southampton University,
the ranges of pay for each family are the same and the emphasis is on defining career progres-
sion rather than market pricing, although market supplements may be paid.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>364 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Job and career families are particularly appropriate for knowledge workers because they
spell out the career ladders that apply specifically to the different categories employed in an
organization.

and growth.
<p>Consider segmenting the reward package for specified groups of knowledge &bull;
workers.

resources they need, the scope to use and develop their knowledge and skills
and the recognition they deserve.

<p>Introduction
<p>Manual worker pay systems that have not been &lsquo;harmonized&rsquo; &ndash; that is, brought into line with
the reward system for staff &ndash; frequently differ from the systems described elsewhere in this
book in three ways. First, the use of a time-rate basis of payment, second the use of spot rates,
and third the use of individual payment-by-results schemes.
<p>Factors affecting the pay of manual workers
<p>The three main factors affecting the pay of manual workers are: first, bargaining arrange-
ments; second, local labour market pressures; and third, trends in the use of technology on the
shopfloor.
<p>Bargaining arrangements
<p>The pay of manual workers is often influenced strongly by national and local agreements with
trade unions, which will determine rates for particular jobs or skill levels. This constitutes an
aspect of the effort bargain. The objectives of workers and their trade union officials and rep-
resentatives is to strike a bargain with management about what they consider to be a reason-
able amount of pay that should be provided by their employer in return for their contribution.
It is, in effect, an agreement between workers and management &ndash; the pay/work bargain &ndash; that
lays down the amount of work to be done for an agreed wage, not just the hours to be worked.
Explicitly or implicitly, all employers are in a bargaining situation with regard to payment
systems. This applies whether or not workers are unionized. Negotiated wage settlements can
also affect non-unionized companies.
<p>Local labour market pressures
<p>Manual workers are usually recruited from the local labour market, where the laws of supply
and demand can have a marked effect on the rates of pay for particular occupations if there is
a skills shortage or surplus, or reluctance on the part of workers to carry out certain jobs. The
local labour market is a fairly perfect market in one of the senses used by economists, namely
that there is widespread and easily available knowledge of rates of pay (the price of labour) and
there may also exist, although not for every occupation, a fair degree of choice by both buyers
and sellers of where they obtain labour or where they provide it.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 367
<p>Technology
<p>The increased use of technology on the shopfloor, for example, in the form of computer-aided
manufacture, has meant that the demand for a number of the traditional skills has diminished
while the demand for new ones has increased. Computer-controlled machines are more likely
to be operated by technicians than by members of the old skilled trades. This is one of the
factors that has led to pressures to harmonize shopfloor and office or laboratory payment
systems.
<p>Time rates
<p>Time rates, also known as day rates, day work, flat rates or hourly rates, provide workers with
a predetermined rate for the actual hours they work. The rate is fixed by formal or informal
negotiations, on the basis of local rates or, less often, by reference to a hierarchy produced by
job evaluation. The rate only varies with time, never with performance or output. However,
additional payments are made on top of base rates for overtime, shift working, night work, call
outs, adverse working conditions and, sometimes, location.
<p>The situation where time rates are most commonly used is where it is thought impossible or
undesirable to use a payment-by-results system, for example in maintenance work. From the
viewpoint of employees, the advantage of time rates is that their earnings are predictable and
steady and they do not have to engage in endless arguments with rate fixers and supervisors
about piece rate or time allowances. The argument against them is that they do not provide a
direct incentive relating the reward to the effort or the results. Two ways of modifying the
basic time-rate approach are to adopt high day rates as described below or measured day work
as covered later in this chapter.
<p>Time rates may take the form of what are often called high day rates. These are higher than the
minimum time rate and may contain a consolidated bonus rate element. The underlying
assumption is that higher base rates will encourage greater effort without the problems created
when operating an incentive scheme. This is in line with the theory of the economy of high
wages mentioned in Chapter 15. High day rates are usually above the local market rates to
attract and retain high-quality workers.
<p>Pay structures
<p>Pay systems for manual workers are seldom graded in the ways described in Chapter 19 unless
their conditions have been harmonized (see later in this chapter). Time rates are usually paid
in the form of spot rates: that is, a fixed rate for a job or an individual. However, spot rates may
be designated for different levels of skill. Traditionally, a person-based pay system was adopted </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>368 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>with three basic rates of pay attached to people &ndash; unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled &ndash; above
which there might be special rates for highly skilled occupations such as toolmakers. Earnings
from payment-by-result schemes were added to these rates. Another arrangement is to have a
more discerning hierarchy of rates linked to skill levels: a form of skill-based pay. Yet another
arrangement is to have a job-based pay system with different rates for different jobs; in a dis-
tribution centre for example: picker, packer and forklift-truck driver.
<p>Incentive schemes for manual workers
<p>Incentive schemes for manual workers consist of:
<p>Payment-by&ndash;results (PBR) schemes, which pay for output and include piecework, &bull;
work-measured schemes and measured day work. Payments are added to base rate
although, rarely, payment is entirely related to output.
<p>Contingent pay schemes, which relate pay to performance or skill (performance-related &bull;
pay and skill-based pay). Increases may be consolidated or paid as lump sum bonuses.
<p>Collective schemes, which pay bonuses related to either team or plant performance. &bull;
<p>Each of these methods is described below. First, however, it is necessary to deal with the con-
siderations affecting the use of incentive schemes.
<p>Considerations affecting the use of incentive schemes
<p>The considerations to be taken into account in developing and maintaining incentive schemes
are the criteria of effectiveness and their advantages and disadvantages.
<p>Criteria of effectiveness
<p>Incentive schemes aim to motivate employees to exert greater effort. They will do so effectively
only if:
<p>The link between effort and reward is obvious and easily understood, ie there is a clear &bull;
line-of-sight.
<p>The value of the reward is worthwhile in relation to the effort. &bull;
<p>Individuals are able to influence their level of effort or behaviour in order to earn a &bull;
reward.
<p>Rewards closely follow the effort. &bull;
<p>The integrity of the scheme is preserved &ndash; it is not allowed to degenerate and cannot be &bull;
manipulated so that individuals are over-rewarded.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 369
<p>The rationale for incentive schemes
<p>The basic rationale of incentive schemes is the simple proposition that people are motivated
by money. It is believed that they will work harder if rewards are tied directly to the results they
achieve. This is essentially &lsquo;Taylorism&rsquo; &ndash; FW Taylor&rsquo;s concept of scientific management,
meaning the use of systematic observation and measurement, task specialism and, in effect,
the reduction of workers to the level of efficiently functioning machines who will only work
harder if they are paid more.
<p>Certainly, the experience of most people who have installed a PBR scheme in a workplace
where it did not previously exist is that productivity increases substantially when the scheme
is new, although the level of increase is not always maintained. Studies in the United States by
Binder (1990), Guzzo, Jette and Katsell (1985), Lawler (1971) and Nalbantian (1987) have
shown productivity increases of between 15 per cent and 35 per cent when incentive schemes
have been put into place.
<p>Incentive schemes are used in the belief that they yield increased output, lower the cost of pro-
duction and provide higher earnings for the workers concerned. It is also commonly believed
that less supervision is needed to keep output up. Indeed, when direct supervision is difficult,
PBR is often advocated as the only practicable form of payment.
<p>Disadvantages of incentive schemes
<p>The argument that people work harder only when they are paid more is regarded by some
people as overwhelming. They do not accept the proposition that intrinsic and non-financial
motivators can have an equally, if not more, powerful and longer-lasting impact.
<p>The disadvantages of shopfloor incentive schemes are that they can:
<p>Be unfair: earnings may fluctuate through no fault of the individual because of lack of &bull;
work, shortage of materials, design modifications or the need to learn new skills. It may
also be felt that the method of altering rates is unfair.
<p>Be ineffective: workers may have their own ideas about how much they want to earn or &bull;
how hard they want to work, and regulate their output accordingly.
<p>Penalize skill: the more skilled workers may be given the more difficult and often less &bull;
remunerative jobs.
<p>Cause wage drift: the difficulty of conforming to criteria such as clearly relating pay to &bull;
effort and the lax approach of some organizations to the management of incentive
schemes contribute to increases in earnings at a higher rate than productivity. Degen-
eration and wage drift are a particular problem with work-measured schemes as dis-
cussed later in this chapter.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>370 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>Lead to management escaping its responsibilities: team leaders and supervisors may &bull;
rely on the incentive scheme to control output. Instead of taking poor performers to
one side and informing them that their work is not up to standard, they are tempted to
take the soft option and simply point to the figures.
<p>Be costly to maintain: extra work-study engineers, rate fixers and inspectors are often &bull;
needed to maintain the scheme and exercise quality control.
<p>Produce strife in the workplace: arguments about rates and accusations of unjustified &bull;
rate-cutting are common in workshops where incentive schemes are used.
<p>Create reluctance to exert the expected level of effort: workers may believe that man- &bull;
agement will progressively increase the performance targets required to trigger the
same bonus payment. They may therefore be reluctant to carry on at the incentivized
level of performance they have achieved, on the grounds that this will only result in
higher targets that will make the bonus more difficult to obtain.
<p>Result in poor-quality work: concentration on output can lead to neglect of quality. &bull;
<p>Lead to poor teamwork: individual incentive schemes by definition encourage indi- &bull;
vidual rather than team effort.
<p>Result in accidents and health hazards: workers may be tempted to cut corners and &bull;
ignore safety precautions to achieve output targets; repetitive strain injury (RSI) may
result if they work too hard on tasks requiring repeated small movements.
<p>These are powerful arguments but shopfloor incentive schemes persist. The number of workers
paid on this basis may have diminished, but this is because of structural (the reduction in
manufacturing) and technological reasons rather than because managements have turned
against it.
<p>Payment by results schemes
Piecework
<p>Piecework is the oldest and simplest form of incentive scheme for manual workers. Operators
are paid at a specific rate according to their output or the number of &lsquo;pieces&rsquo; they produce. Pay
is directly proportional to output, although most piecework schemes provide a fallback rate at
minimum earnings level. The proportion of the minimum rate to average earnings varies. It is
typically set at 70 or 80 per cent, although it can be as low as 30 per cent.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 371
<p>Work-measured schemes
<p>Work-measured schemes are the most popular form of incentive plan for shopfloor workers.
They use work-measurement techniques to determine standard output levels over a period or
standard times for tasks. The incentive pay is then linked with the output achieved relative to
the standard, or to the time saved in performing each task.
<p>The form of work measurement used is time study. Jobs are broken down into their constitu-
ent parts or tasks and the time taken by workers to complete each part is measured with a stop-
watch by a work-study or industrial engineer. A number of measurements will be made of the
time taken by different workers on the same task or the same worker carrying out the task at
different times of the day and night. Time study is based on objective measurements, but
account has to be taken of the fact that there will probably be significant differences between
the rates at which operators work &ndash; the effort they put into the job. Work-study engineers have
therefore to assess what that rate is, a process known as effort rating.
<p>Individual effort is rated in terms of &lsquo;standard performance&rsquo;. This is the performance that a
qualified and motivated worker should be able to achieve without over-exertion. The effort
needed to achieve standard performance is sometimes represented as equivalent to walking at
four miles an hour (ie quite briskly). All the operators studied are given an effort rating relative
to this standard. The raw times observed in the work study are then adjusted by the work-
study engineer to produce a basic time that represents a rating of 100 to indicate the perform-
ance of an average operator working conscientiously without financial motivation. This
involves a large element of subjectivity, although experienced and well-trained engineers
should be capable of making reasonably accurate and consistent assessments.
<p>The basic time will be further adjusted to incorporate allowances for relaxation, personal
needs, fatigue and any time regularly taken up by other aspects of the work such as cleaning or
resetting machines. The result is the standard time for the task, usually expressed as &lsquo;standard
minutes&rsquo;.
<p>Work-measured schemes can use performance ratings that are calculated by a formula as in
the following example:
<p>Number of units produced per day (132) &times; standard minutes per unit (4)
Actual time taken in minutes per day (48)
<p>528
480
<p>&times; 100 = 110%=
<p>In the most common proportionate system of payment, the performance rating is applied
directly to the base rate, so that in the above example the incentive payment would be an addi-
tional 10 per cent.
<p>The problem with time study is that, although it is based on objective measurements, the
standard time that is ultimately obtained is the product of a number of additional subjective
judgements. Employees who are being timed may deliberately restrict their performance in
order to achieve low standard times and therefore higher bonuses with less effort. It is up to </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>372 Rewarding Special Groups
<p>the work-study engineer&rsquo;s skill and judgement to detect such restrictions, and this can lead to
arguments and even strife. In organizations with trade unions it is common practice to train
some representatives in work-measurement techniques to promote the achievement of accept-
able judgements on standard times.
<p>Alternatively, PBR payments can be based on the time-saved principle. The amount of the
bonus depends on the difference between the actual time taken to perform the task and the
standard time allowed. If a task is done in less than the standard time, then the percentage of
time saved is applied to the base rate to calculate the bonus. The standard times may be deter-
mined by work measurement, although traditionally &lsquo;rate fixers&rsquo; were employed to make more
subjective and therefore often more controversial judgements.
<p>Measured day work
<p>Measured day work schemes were originally developed for large batch or mass-production
factories in the 1950s and 1960s, when it became evident that, despite all efforts, it was impos-
sible to control wage drift. They are, however, much less common now. Manufacturing firms
often prefer to pay a high day rate.
<p>When they exist, measured day work schemes provide for the pay of employees to be fixed on
the understanding that they will maintain a specified level of performance, but in the short
term pay does not fluctuate with their performance. The arrangement depends on work meas-
urement to define the required level of performance and to monitor the actual level. The fun-
damental principles of measured day work are that there is an incentive level of performance
and that the incentive payment is guaranteed in advance, putting employees under the obliga-
tion to perform at the effort level required. In contrast, a conventional work-measured incen-
tive scheme allows employees discretion as to their effort level but relates their pay directly to
the results they achieve. Between these two extremes there are a variety of alternatives, includ-
ing banded incentives, stepped schemes and various forms of high day rate.
<p>Contingent pay schemes
Performance-related pay
<p>Performance-related pay systems such as those described in Chapter 10 can be used for manual
workers. Employees receive a high base rate and an additional performance-related payment,
which is either a lump sum bonus or consolidated into basic pay. The award is governed by
assessments of skill and performance ratings under headings such as quality, flexibility, con-
tribution to teamworking and ability to hit targets. The percentage award is usually small &ndash; up
to 5 per cent.</p>

<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 373
<p>Performance-related pay is sometimes introduced for manual workers as part of a programme
for harmonizing their conditions of employment with those of salaried staff. It can be appro-
priate in circumstances where work measurement is difficult or impossible to use, in high-
technology manufacturing where operations are computer-controlled or automated and
teamwork and multiskilling are important, in organizations where the emphasis is on quality,
and in those where just-in-time systems are used. But it is difficult to operate and trade unions
tend to be hostile, and it is therefore uncommon.
<p>Skill-based pay
<p>Skill-based pay, as described in detail in Chapter 10, rewards people with extra pay for acquir-
ing and using additional skills. It can be paid as a supplement to a base rate or it can result in
workers being placed on a higher spot rate.
<p>Collective schemes
Group or team incentive schemes
<p>Group or team incentive schemes provide for the payment of a bonus to members of a group
or team related to the output achieved by the group in relation to defined targets or to work-
measured standards.
<p>Factory or plant-wide schemes
<p>Factory or plant-wide schemes pay a bonus to individuals that is related to the performance of
the factory as a whole, which may be measured in terms of added value as in a gain-sharing
scheme (see Chapter 13) or some other index of productivity (eg units produced, cost per unit
of output). The bonus may be added to individual incentive payments.
<p>Assessment of schemes
<p>Table 23.1 contains an assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of scheme
from the viewpoint of employers and employees and a review of the circumstances when the
scheme is more likely to be appropriate.</p>

<p>Rewarding Manual Workers 377
<p>Single status and harmonization
<p>Single status means that manual or shopfloor workers on wages are on salaried terms and con-
ditions and are entitled to the same conditions of employment, such as sick pay, as other
members of staff. Harmonization means the reduction of differences in the pay structure and
other employment conditions between categories of employee, usually manual and staff
employees. It involves the adoption of a common approach and criteria to pay and benefits for
all employees.
<p>The pressure for harmonization has occurred because of the belief that status differentials
between people in the same employment cannot be justified. Harmonization facilitates the
more flexible use of labour, and the impact of technology has enhanced the skills of shopfloor
workers and made differential treatment harder to defend. Equal pay legislation has been a
major challenge to differentiation between staff and manual workers.
<p>ACAS (1982) suggested that organizations, before pursuing a programme of harmonization,
should seek answers to the following questions:
<p>What differences in the treatment of groups of employees are a rational result of differ- &bull;
ences in the work or the job requirements?
<p>Is it possible to estimate the direct costs of removing these differences? &bull;
<p>What differences in status are explicitly recognized as part of the &lsquo;reward package&rsquo; for &bull;
different groups in the labour force?
<p>What would be the possible repercussive effects of harmonization? &bull;
<p>How do the existing differences affect industrial relations in the organization? &bull;
<p>Rewarding manual workers: six tips
Consider scope for single status or harmonization. &bull;
<p>Ensure that rates of pay for jobs and people are linked to the level of skill or the &bull;
degree of multiskilling required.
<p>If planning to introduce new payment-by-results schemes or amend existing &bull;
ones, involve employees and their representatives in discussions on what needs
to be done and reach agreement on how the changes should be introduced.
<p>Consider introducing team pay or gain-sharing. &bull;
<p>Ensure that payment-by-results schemes are based on work measurement and &bull;
provide a clear line of sight between effort and reward.
<p>Review all existing payment-by-results schemes to ensure that they are &bull;
functioning properly and are not encouraging wage drift.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Employee benefits consist of arrangements made by employers for their employees that
enhance the latter&rsquo;s well-being. They are provided in addition to pay and form important
parts of the total reward package. As part of total remuneration, they may be deferred or
contingent, like a pension scheme (see Chapter 26), insurance cover or sick pay, or they may

<p>382 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>be immediate, like a company car or a loan. Employee benefits also include holidays and
leave arrangements, which are not strictly remuneration. Benefits are sometimes referred to
dismissively as &lsquo;perks&rsquo; (perquisites) or &lsquo;fringe benefits&rsquo;, but when they cater for personal
security or personal needs they could hardly be described as &lsquo;fringe&rsquo;.
<p>Employee benefits are a costly part of the remuneration package. They can amount to a third
or more of basic pay costs and therefore have to be planned and managed with care.
<p>Note that many benefits such as company cars, interest-free loans, private medical insurance,
and prizes, gifts and vouchers can be taxed quite heavily. It is worth seeking advice from a tax
specialist if in any doubt.
<p>Rationale for employee benefits
<p>Employee benefits provide for the personal needs of employees and they are a means of increas-
ing their commitment to the organization and demonstrating that their employers care for
their well-being. Not all employers care but, like the ones that do, they still provide benefits to
ensure that the total remuneration package is competitive. And some benefits, such as mater-
nity leave, have to be provided by law in the UK.
<p>Employee benefit strategies and policies
<p>Employee benefit strategies will be concerned in general terms with the direction the organiza-
tion wants to go with regard to the range and scale of benefits it wants to provide and the costs
it is prepared to incur. The strategy forms the foundation for the formulation of employee
benefit policies.
<p>Employee benefit policies are concerned with:
<p>the types of benefits to be provided, taking into account their value to employees, their &bull;
cost and the need to make the benefit package competitive;
<p>the size of the benefits; &bull;
<p>the need to harmonize benefits; &bull;
<p>the total costs of benefits provision in relation to the costs of basic pay; &bull;
<p>the use of flexible benefits, as described in Chapter 25. &bull;</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>Employee Benefits 383
<p>Types of benefit
<p>The main benefits deal with personal security, financial assistance, personal needs, holidays,
company cars, other benefits, voluntary benefits and concierge services as described below.
<p>Personal security
<p>Personal security benefits include:
<p>Health care: the provision through medical insurance of private health care to cover &bull;
the cost of private hospital treatment (permanent health insurance), making periodic
health screening available and, sometimes, dental insurance.
<p>Insurance cover: for death in service (if not already provided in a pension scheme), &bull;
personal accident and business travel.
<p>Sick pay: providing full pay for a given period of sickness and a proportion of pay (typ- &bull;
ically half-pay for a further period). Sick pay entitlement is usually service-related. Sick
pay can be costly unless attendance management and control practices are intro-
duced.
<p>Redundancy pay: additions can be made to the statutory redundancy pay, including &bull;
extra notice compensation, extra service-related payments (eg one month per year of
service) and ex gratia payments to directors and executives in compensation for loss of
office (sometimes called golden handshakes).
<p>Career counselling (outplacement advice) can be provided by specialist consultants to &bull;
employees who have been made redundant.
<p>Financial assistance
<p>Financial assistance can take the following forms:
<p>Company loans: interest-free modest loans, or low interest on more substantial loans, &bull;
which are usually earmarked for specific purposes such as home improvements.
<p>Season ticket loans: interest-free loans for annual season tickets. &bull;
<p>Mortgage assistance: subsidized interest payments on mortgages up to a given price &bull;
threshold. This benefit is most likely to be provided by financial services companies.
<p>Relocation packages: for staff who are being relocated by the organization or recruited &bull;
from elsewhere, the costs of removal and legal/estate agents&rsquo; fees may be refunded.
<p>Fees to professional bodies: eg the CIPD. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>

<p>384 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Personal needs
<p>Employee benefits satisfying personal needs include:
<p>maternity and paternity leave and pay above the statutory minimum; &bull;
<p>leave for personal reasons; &bull;
<p>childcare through workplace nurseries or vouchers; &bull;
<p>pre-retirement counselling; &bull;
<p>personal counselling through employee assistance programmes; &bull;
<p>sports and social facilities; &bull;
<p>company discounts, whereby employees can buy the products or services offered by the &bull;
company at a reduced price;
<p>retail vouchers to buy goods at chain stores. &bull;
<p>Holidays
<p>Before the European Working Time Directive in 1998, there was no statutory obligation to
offer any paid holiday except for the standard &lsquo;bank&rsquo; holidays. Employers are now obliged to
offer a minimum of 20 days&rsquo; paid holiday per year, including bank holidays.
<p>In practice, most organizations have always offered annual leave well in excess of this minimum,
with few UK companies giving less than four weeks to employees at any level. Basic holiday
entitlements are typically five weeks plus bank holidays, with some organizations offering up
to six weeks for senior executives (who in practice may rarely have time to take full advantage
of the provision) or on a service-related basis to more junior staff. The entitlement for holiday
begins to accrue on the first day at work.
<p>Organizations are obliged by statute to provide paid maternal and paternal leave and unpaid
family leave.
<p>Company cars
<p>Although the tax liability for individuals with company &lsquo;status&rsquo; cars has increased steadily over
the last decade, they still remain one of the most valued perks, perhaps because people do not
have to make a capital outlay, do not lose money through depreciation and are spared the
worry and expense of maintenance.
<p>Other benefits
<p>Other benefits include free car parking, Christmas parties and tea/coffee/cold drinks.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Employee Benefits 385
<p>Voluntary (&lsquo;affinity&rsquo;) benefits
<p>Voluntary benefit schemes provide opportunities for employees to buy goods or services at
discounted prices. The employers negotiate deals with the providers but the scheme does not
cost them anything.
<p>Popular voluntary benefits include:
<p>Health: private medical insurance, dental insurance, health screening. &bull;
<p>Protection: critical illness insurance, life insurance, income protection insurance, per- &bull;
sonal accident insurance.
<p>Leisure: holidays, days out, travel insurance, computer leasing, bicycle leasing, pet &bull;
insurance, gym membership.
<p>Home: household goods, online shopping. &bull;
<p>Concierge services
<p>Concierge services can include dealing with home and car repair and maintenance, financial
services, buying presents, restaurant reservations, theatre tickets and travel arrangements.
They originated in the United States in response to the long-hours culture that limited per-
sonal time away from the workplace. Businesses benefit from providing these services because
they enable staff to concentrate on their jobs by freeing them from mundane personal tasks
such as waiting at home for deliveries or getting their cars serviced.
<p>At PricewaterhouseCoopers staff can pay a fixed sum a month for requests. These can be for
anything from shopping, theatre tickets, travel arrangements or arranging a plumber, to event
planning &ndash; &lsquo;so long as it&rsquo;s legal&rsquo;.
<p>Incidence of benefits
<p>The proportion of respondents to the 2009 CIPD reward management survey providing six
key benefits were:
<p>25 days paid leave: 67 per cent. &bull;
<p>Free car parking: 60 per cent. &bull;
<p>Childcare vouchers: 56 per cent. &bull;
<p>Life insurance: 51 per cent. &bull;
<p>Enhanced maternity/paternity leave: 43 per cent. &bull;
<p>An employee assistance programme: 42 per cent. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>386 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Choice of benefits
<p>Some benefits, such as holidays, maternity leave and redundancy pay, have to be provided by
statute &ndash; there is no choice except on the extent to which statutory provisions may by enhanced.
Neither, for a responsible employer, is there any real choice over the provision of pensions, life
insurance or sick pay. Company cars for executives are still popular in spite of the tax penalties
because of the felt need to be competitive.
<p>Some optional benefits such as health insurance, childcare and low-interest loans may be
selected because they will be appreciated and because they help to make the reward package
competitive.
<p>The factors affecting the choice of or provision or scale will be:
<p>what employees want, as established by opinion surveys; &bull;
<p>what other employers are providing, as established by market surveys; &bull;
<p>what the organization can afford. &bull;
<p>Flexible benefit schemes give employees a choice within limits of the type or scale of benefits
offered to them by their employers.
<p>Administering employee benefits
<p>Employee benefits can be expensive and it is necessary to monitor the costs of providing them
and the extent to which a cost&ndash;benefit comparison justifies continuing with them on the
present scale or at all. There should be a budget for employee benefit costs and expenditure
should be monitored against it. Regular surveys should be undertaken of the attitude of
employees to the benefits package. They may suggest where benefit expenditure could be redi-
rected to areas where it would be more appreciated. They may also suggest that there is a need
to adopt a flexible benefit policy, as described in the next chapter.
<p>Total reward statements
<p>Total reward statements communicate to employees the value of the employee benefits such
as pensions, holidays, company cars, free car parking and subsidized meals they receive in
addition to their pay. They also describe any other rewards they get, such as learning and
development opportunities. The aim is to ensure that they appreciate the total value of their
reward package. Too often, people are unaware of what they obtain in addition to their pay.
Table 24.1 shows how a total reward statement can be set out.</p>

Review the benefit package regularly to establish that the benefits provided are &bull;
desirable and cost-effective, that they are appreciated and that they are
administered efficiently.
<p>Survey employees to find out what they think of the benefits package and what &bull;
they think it should look like.
<p>Ensure that the benefits package reflects good practice as established by &bull;
benchmarking.
<p>Ensure that the benefits package is competitive and enhances the reputation of &bull;
the business as a good employer.
<p>Ensure that employees appreciate the value of the benefits they receive by &bull;
issuing total reward statements.
<p>Consider giving employees the opportunity to choose their benefits through a &bull;
flexible benefits scheme.

Flexible Benefits

<p>How to introduce flexible benefits &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Flexible benefit schemes give employees a choice within limits of the type or scale of benefits
offered to them by their employers. A wide variety of approaches is available.
<p>Interest in such schemes has been generated because employee benefits are not all equally
wanted or appreciated by the staff that receive them and, from the employer&rsquo;s point of view,
some benefits will not therefore provide value for money. However, the number that have
introduced formal flexible schemes is relatively small &ndash; only 13 per cent of the respondents to
the CIPD 2008 Reward Management Survey had them. In this chapter the reasons for intro-
ducing flexible benefits are set out, the different types of flexible benefit schemes are defined
and the steps required to introduce a scheme are explained.
<p>Reasons for introducing flexible benefits
<p>Flexible benefit schemes may be introduced in order to:

<p>Flexible Benefits 389
<p>meet the diverse needs of employees and increase the perceived value of the package to &bull;
them &ndash; enabling them, to a degree, to decide for themselves what benefits they want
and the size of particular benefits to suit their own life style rather than being forced to
accept what their employers think is good for them;
<p>enable employers to get better value for money from their benefits expenditure because &bull;
it meets the needs and wants of employees;
<p>control costs by providing employees with a fund to spend rather than promising a &bull;
particular level of benefits;

ees to fixed benefits of equivalent value;
<p>help to harmonize terms and conditions in a merger. &bull;
<p>Types of flexible benefits schemes
<p>The main types of schemes are described below.
<p>Flex individual benefits
<p>Employees are given the opportunity to vary the size of individual benefits, paying extra if they
want more or, in effect, being paid cash if they want less. A typical example is a flexible car
scheme that enables people to pay more for a better model or, if they decide to downsize,
receive the reduction in cost to the company in cash. Choices are made on recruitment or
when the car is replaced.
<p>Another common arrangement is to provide scope, within limits, to buy or sell holiday time
over the holiday year; for example, so many extra days could be &lsquo;bought&rsquo; at the daily rate of the
employee or so many could be &lsquo;sold&rsquo; and the amount at the daily rate added to pay.
<p>This is a simple approach that is easy to introduce and administer and is therefore the most
common method of flexing benefits. The disadvantage is that the impact may be limited.
<p>Flex existing entitlement
<p>Employees may choose to increase, decrease or end their current benefits and select new ben-
efits from the menu provided. The value of the benefits bought and sold is then aggregated and
the net amount added to or deducted from pay. An example of how this might look for an
employee whose salary is &pound;30,000 per annum is shown in Table 25.1.</p>

<p>This arrangement can be simplified by making only two or three benefits flexible. The
rules often stipulate that such essential core benefits as pensions and life insurance cannot
be reduced, and limits may be placed on the scope for flexing other benefits, for example
holidays.
<p>Flex fund
<p>Employees are allocated a fund of money to &lsquo;spend&rsquo; on benefits from a menu. This is therefore
sometimes described as the &lsquo;cafeteria&rsquo; approach. Certain &lsquo;core&rsquo; compulsory benefits such as
pensions and life insurance have to be maintained. The value of the flex fund is big enough to
enable individual employees to &lsquo;buy&rsquo; their existing benefits and thus retain them without addi-
tional cost.
<p>A simplified example of a flex fund benefits-choice menu for someone with a salary of &pound;30,000
with a flex fund of &pound;12,000 is shown in Table 25.2.
<p>The impact of the choices made is shown in Table 25.3.
<p>Any overspend would be funded by salary sacrifice. In this example, where less than &pound;12,000
has been spent, the unspent flex fund would be paid as a monthly, non-consolidated cash
sum.</p>

<p>392 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Introducing flexible benefits
<p>The steps required to introduce flexible benefits are described below:
<p>1. Define business need: the benefits in terms of meeting the diverse needs of employees,
helping recruitment and retention and getting better value for money from expenditure
on employee benefits.
<p>2. Seek views: conduct an opinion survey of employees on what they think of present
benefit arrangements, what they think about flexible benefits and what benefits they
would like to be eligible for flex (this could be accompanied by information about how
flexible benefits might work, and would therefore be the first shot in a communications
campaign &ndash; communicating about flexible benefits is important).
<p>3. Decide objectives and essential elements: the objectives of the scheme should be deter-
mined and its essential elements defined. This will include broadly the extent to which it
is believed that the approach should be to go for a full scheme based either on flexing
existing benefits or a flex fund, or whether the approach should be to flex individual ben-
efits. There may be something to be said for starting with the latter, simpler approach
(which will be cheaper to install) with the possibility of extending it at a later stage when
experience has shown that it is working well. The strategy should also explore the need for
outside advice and, on the basis of initial discussions with potential advisors, how much
would need to be spent on developing and maintaining the scheme. One of the common
objections to flexible benefits is the costs involved, especially when the proposed scheme
is a fairly complex one and outside professional advice and support is required. Prelimi-
nary decisions need to be made at this stage on the likelihood that such advice will be
required so that the costs involved can be estimated. It is also necessary to decide on the
need for a project team with employee involvement.
<p>4. Set up project team: this could be a joint management/employee team (involvement is
very desirable) with the responsibility of planning and overseeing the development pro-
gramme.
<p>5. Decide who is going to carry out the development work: someone from within the organ-
ization should be in charge of the project, with help as required and available from flexible
benefit, finance, tax and pensions specialists. The development of a scheme requires con-
siderable expertise in these areas in developing and costing schemes, exploring tax consid-
erations and setting up the administration.
<p>6. Design scheme: this involves deciding on core benefits, which will have to be maintained,
identifying benefits that can be flexed and any limits on the extent to which these benefits
can be flexed, costing the benefits as necessary to enable menus to be produced and flex
funds set up, if appropriate, and considering how the scheme should be administered.
Simple schemes can be administered on paper but there is software available to administer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Flexible Benefits 393
<p>more elaborate ones. An intranet can be used to help with administration &ndash; employees can
make their choice of benefits from the screen and calculate the financial implications.
<p>7. Communicate details of the scheme: employees need to be given detailed but easily under-
stood information about the proposed scheme &ndash; how it will work, how it will affect them,
its advantages, and how and when it will be introduced.
<p>8. Pilot test: there is much to be said for piloting the scheme in a part of the organization to
test reactions and administrative arrangements.
<p>9. Introduce scheme: the earlier communications need to be reinforced generally at this
stage and arrangements must be made to provide individual employees with advice
through personal contact, a help line or a help screen on the intranet.
<p>10. Evaluate scheme: monitor and measure impact.

<p>Introduction
<p>Pensions provide an income to employees when they retire and to their surviving dependants
on the death of the employee, and deferred benefits to employees who leave. Occupational
schemes offered by organizations, as distinct from state pensions, are funded by contributions
from the organization and usually, but not always, the employee. Occupational pensions are

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 395
<p>the most significant employee benefit and are a valuable part of the total reward package. But
they are perhaps the most complex part.
<p>The so-called &lsquo;pensions crisis&rsquo; has arisen because many occupational schemes are underfunded
and suffering the strain of having to cope with more pensioners who are living longer. But to
put it in perspective it should be remembered that a huge amount of money in the UK (&pound;1,300
billion) is invested in pension funds, more than in the rest of the EU put together.
<p>The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of why pensions are provided, what they
provide and the main types of schemes. The reasons for the shift in occupational schemes
from defined benefits (final salary) schemes to defined contribution (money purchase schemes)
are discussed, and the chapter continues with a summary of the law relating to providing pen-
sions advice and a discussion of approaches to communicating about pensions.
<p>Why occupational pensions are provided
<p>Pensions are provided because they demonstrate that the organization is a good employer
concerned about the long-term interests of its employees who want the security provided by a
reasonable pension when they retire. Good pension schemes help to attract and retain high-
quality people by maintaining competitive levels of total remuneration.
<p>What occupational pension schemes provide
<p>The range and level of benefits from pension schemes depend on the type of scheme and the
level of contributions. In general, schemes provide:
<p>Benefits on retirement: these are related to the final salary of individuals when they &bull;
retire or the amount that has been paid into a defined contribution scheme while the
individuals were members.
<p>Benefits on death: the pensions of widows or widowers and children are normally &bull;
related to the member&rsquo;s anticipated pension; the most common fraction is half.
<p>Benefits on leaving an employer: individuals leaving an employer can elect to take one &bull;
of the following options: a deferred pension from the occupational scheme they are
leaving, the transfer of the pension entitlement from the present employer to the new
employer (though this is not always possible), or a refund of their contributions (but
only if they have completed less than two years&rsquo; membership of the pension scheme).</p>

<br>
<p>396 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>The two main types of occupational schemes
<p>The two main types of occupational schemes are described below. Other types are covered in
the next section.
<p>Defined benefit (final salary) schemes
<p>The main features of a defined benefit scheme are outlined below.
<p>Pension entitlement on retirement
<p>On retiring the employee is entitled to a pension that is calculated as a fraction of their &bull;
final salary (on retirement or an average of the last two or three years) multiplied by the
length of pensionable service.
<p>The maximum proportion of salary allowed by the Inland Revenue is two-thirds of &bull;
final salary after 40 years service.
<p>The amount of the pension depends on the final salary, the value of the annuity that &bull;
provides the pension and the accrual rate. The accrual rate refers to the fraction of final
salary that can be earned per year of service. When a pension is described as 1/60th it
means that 40 years service would produce a two-thirds of final salary pension, and 30
years would produce a pension of half the final salary. This is a fairly typical fraction in
private sector firms.
<p>Employer and employee contributions
<p>Employer contributions can be a fixed percentage of salary. Alternatively the percent- &bull;
age increases with service or is a multiple of the employee&rsquo;s contribution (eg the
employer contributes 15 per cent if the employee contributes 5 per cent). The level of
employer contribution is typically around 16 per cent.
<p>Employee contribution rates vary considerably, ranging from 3 per cent to 15 per cent &bull;
with a median of around 8 per cent.
<p>Pension fund
<p>Employee and employer contributions are paid into a combined fund and there is no &bull;
direct link between fund size and the pensions paid.
<p>The money remaining in the fund after any lump sums have been taken out is invested &bull;
in an annuity to provide a regular income, the amount of which may be revised upwards
periodically to compensate for inflation.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 397
<p>Dependants
<p>Dependants are entitled to a percentage of the employee&rsquo;s pension entitlement if he or she dies
during retirement or in service with the company.
<p>Lump sum
<p>Part of the pension may be exchanged for a tax-free lump sum, up to a maximum under
Inland Revenue rules of 1/80th per year for up to 40 years service.
<p>Defined contribution (money purchase) schemes
<p>The main features of a defined contribution scheme are discussed below.
<p>Pension entitlement
<p>The employee receives a pension on retirement that is related to the size of the fund accumu-
lated by the combined contributions of the employee and employer. The amount of the
pension depends on the size of contributions, the rate of return on the investment of the accu-
mulated fund and the rate of return on an annuity purchased by the employer. It is not related
to the employee&rsquo;s final salary.
<p>Contributions
<p>The employer contributes a defined percentage of earnings, which may be fixed, age-related or
linked to what the employee pays. The level of employer contribution is typically around 6 per
cent. The employee also contributes a fixed percentage of salary.
<p>Pension fund
<p>The contributions are invested and the money used at retirement to purchase a regular income,
usually via an annuity contract from an insurance company. The retirement pension is there-
fore whatever annual payment can be purchased with the money accumulated in the fund for
a member.
<p>Members have individual shares of the fund, which represent their personal entitlements and
which will directly determine the pensions they receive.
<p>Dependants
<p>Dependants receive death in service and death in retirement pensions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>398 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Lump sum
<p>One-quarter of the pension can be taken as a tax-free lump sum on retirement.
<p>Comparison of defined benefits and defined contribution schemes
<p>The main differences are that a defined benefits (final salary) scheme provides a guaranteed
pension to the employee but the employer is unable to predict the costs, which can fluctuate
unfavourably. Conversely, a defined contribution (money purchase) scheme provides an
uncertain pension and the cost to the employer is predictable. The differences are summarized
in Table 26.1.
<p>Defined benefit or defined contribution?
Defined benefit scheme costs and risks
<p>Defined benefit schemes are more costly to employers (16 per cent average contribution)
than defined contribution schemes (6 per cent average contribution). They are also more
risky for employers because the pension is based on a guaranteed formula and the cost of
providing this guaranteed benefit may be higher than expected. Typically, employee contri-
butions are fixed and those of the employer vary on the basis of specialist advice from the
scheme actuary. Hence, the risk of higher than expected costs falls on the employer. Costs

<p>Benefits defined as a fraction of final
pensionable pay.
<p>Benefits purchased as an annuity by an

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 399
<p>might exceed expectations for a number of reasons, for example pensioners are living longer
(an important factor in putting up costs), the fund investments may perform less well than
expected (another important factor recently) or salaries may grow faster than expected.
Costs have in fact increased significantly in many schemes and as a result some large pension
funds are in deficit.
<p>Defined contribution scheme costs and risks
<p>In a defined contribution scheme the cost of employer contributions is predictable and gener-
ally lower than in defined benefit schemes. However, there is a risk that the resulting pension
falls short of expectations because the fund investments perform poorly or because the annuity
rate (ie the conversion rate from lump sum to regular pension) is unfavourable. This risk falls
on the employee.
<p>The move towards defined contribution schemes
<p>Many leading companies have questioned the financial wisdom of final salary provision.
Defined benefit schemes provide much more value to older and longer-serving employees but
greater labour mobility has led many employers to question this emphasis, particularly in
newer industries with young, high-turnover workforces.
<p>The CIPD 2009 Reward Management Survey established that 52 per cent of employers had
defined benefit schemes but these were much more common in the public sector (91 per cent).
Private sector companies have mainly closed their defined benefit schemes to new entrants
and a number are switching existing employees into defined contribution schemes.
<p>Defined benefit schemes are liked by employees and trade unions because they produce a
guaranteed income. Trade unions are therefore always hostile to any move towards defined
contribution schemes. Such a move will appear to threaten personal security and be detrimen-
tal. Even if the change is restricted to new staff, existing employees may well believe, with some
reason, that it will be applied to them some time.
<p>Rather than change to a defined contribution scheme, some companies have taken steps to
reduce final salary scheme costs. This means retaining final salary provision but with some
benefits scaled back. For example, employers have reduced the accrual rate from 1/60th per
year of service to 1/80th or, more commonly, have increased employee contributions. Employ-
ees and unions are likely to resist such changes but may eventually be persuaded that they are
better than a move towards defined contribution provision.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>400 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>Other types of pension schemes
Hybrid schemes
<p>Hybrid occupational pension schemes aim to split the risk between both parties, although
only 2 per cent of the CIPD respondents had them. For example, a defined benefit scheme
might be provided for staff who meet an age and/or service qualification, with defined contri-
bution provision applying to other staff.
<p>Personal pensions
<p>Employers cannot compel their employees to join their scheme. As an alternative, employees
can take out their own personal pension plan from an approved provider, either as an alterna-
tive to an occupational scheme provided by the employer or because there is no occupational
scheme available. Personal pension schemes can be contracted out of the State pension scheme
and may take contributions from an employer. They are defined contribution (ie money pur-
chase) schemes, which means that the pension is based on what has been paid into the scheme
and not on final salary.
<p>Group schemes
<p>Group schemes are in effect a bundle of individual personal pensions for which the employer
carries out a payroll function by remitting contributions to a pensions provider.
<p>Stakeholder pension
<p>A stakeholder pension is a government-sponsored scheme, primarily designed for lower-paid
employees. It is a low-cost personal pension scheme regulated by the government and pro-
vided through pension companies. Employers who employ five or more staff and do not
provide a suitable occupational pension scheme for their employees are required by law to
offer access to a stakeholder scheme and deduct and pass on employee contributions to the
scheme. But employers do not have to make contributions themselves.
<p>A stakeholder pension is a defined contribution arrangement that satisfies certain conditions,
designed to ensure that it provides good value for money and that members&rsquo; interests are pro-
tected. These conditions are:
<p>Flexible contributions: members must be free to pay whatever contributions they like. &bull;
<p>Charges: the maximum charge is 1.5 per cent of the fund. &bull;
<p>Transfers: the scheme is required to accept transfer payments. &bull;
<p>FSA regulation: all stakeholder schemes are regulated by the Financial Services Agency. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Pension Schemes 401
<p>Investments: the scheme must offer a default investment scheme for members who are &bull;
unwilling to choose between different funds.
<p>Executive pensions
<p>In the private sector, executive pensions are typically provided for by a defined benefit scheme
with an accelerated accrual compared with that for other staff. Instead of providing a maximum
two-thirds pension after 40 years of service (an accrual rate of 1/60th per year of service), a full
pension may be earned after only 20 or 30 years&rsquo; service (equivalent to an accrual rate of
1/30th or 1/45th). The two-thirds pension provided is normally inclusive of any pensions
from previous employments.
<p>The state pension scheme
<p>State pension arrangements are subject to change, and this section is based on the current
(2010) arrangements. The State Pension Scheme has two parts, as described below.
<p>The Basic State Pension
<p>The basic state pension is paid at a standard rate, which may be increased each year as long as
the required number of National Insurance contributions have been paid.
<p>The State Second Pension
<p>The State Second Pension (also known as the State Additional Pension) pays a pension on
earnings for which Class 1 National Insurance contributions have been paid over the years
that fall between the lower and the upper earnings limit. The lower earnings limit corresponds
roughly with the flat-rate pension for a single person while the upper limit is currently about
eight times the lower earning limit. Both limits are adjusted from time to time.
<p>Employers and individuals with a personal pension plan can contract out of the State Second
Pension. Occupational pension schemes can contract out if they meet an overall quality test.
When a scheme is contracted out, both the employer and the employee pay National Insur-
ance contributions at a lower rate.
<p>Advising employees on pensions
<p>The Financial Services Act 1986 and the Pensions Act 1995 place restrictions on the provi-
sion of financial advice to employees. Only those who are directly authorized by one of the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>402 Employee Benefit and Pension Schemes
<p>regulatory organizations or professional bodies are permitted to give detailed financial
advice on investments. Specific advice on the merits or otherwise of a particular personal
pension plan &ndash; personal pensions are classed as investments by the Financial Services Act &ndash;
can, however, be given to employees:
<p>On the company&rsquo;s occupational pension scheme, since it is not classed as an investment. &bull;
<p>About the general principles to be borne in mind when comparing an occupational &bull;
pension scheme with a personal pension; these could include spelling out the benefits
of the company&rsquo;s scheme, thus leaving employees in a better position to compare the
benefits with whatever an authorized adviser may indicate are the benefits from a per-
sonal plan. What should not be done is to tell people categorically that they will be
better off with the company&rsquo;s scheme or to advise them to look elsewhere.
<p>On their rights, for staff who are leaving, to preserve their pension and the advisability &bull;
of finding out from their prospective employer whether existing rights can be trans-
ferred to their scheme and, if so, what the outcome will be in terms of pension rights at
the new company.
<p>On the general advantages of making additional voluntary contributions. &bull;
<p>HR specialists should restrict themselves to giving factual information. They should never
suggest what people should do. If in any doubt as to how to respond to a request for informa-
tion or advice, it is best to refer the matter to the company&rsquo;s own pension specialist or adviser
or, if none is available, suggest that the employee should talk to an authorized adviser, for
example the individual&rsquo;s own insurance company or bank.
<p>Developing and communicating pensions policies
<p>The pension benefits provided by employers should be developed as an important part of a
coherent total reward package. Good schemes demonstrate that employers care about the
future security and well-being of their employees, and pensions are a valuable means of gaining
and keeping employee commitment to the organization. Younger and more mobile employ-
ees are often indifferent to pensions, but the older they get the more they are concerned, and
these mature employees contribute largely to organizational success.
<p>Careful consideration needs to be given to telling employees about the scheme. They need to
know how it works and how it benefits them &ndash; it is too easy for employees to take pensions for
granted. It is particularly important to communicate the reasons for any changes and how
they will affect staff. This is a demanding situation if a defined benefit scheme is to be replaced
by a defined contribution scheme. HR professionals have a key role to play in being honest
about the real picture and its alternatives, and informing employees of all the implications.</p>

<p>Pension schemes: six tips
If you have a defined benefit (final salary) scheme, evaluate the pros and cons of &bull;
replacing it with a defined contribution (money purchase) scheme for all
employees or only for newly recruited employees.
<p>If you believe it is necessary to switch to a defined contribution scheme, &bull;
evaluate the pros and cons of leaving existing employees in their defined benefit
scheme or transferring them into a defined contribution scheme.
<p>When examining the pros and cons, consider the possible effects on the morale &bull;
of existing employees and the impact it might have on attracting new
employees.
<p>Prepare the case for replacing a defined benefits scheme with great care. It is &bull;
essential to provide convincing reasons for a change that will adversely affect
the terms and conditions of employees.
<p>Communicate the decision through all the channels available. Be prepared for a &bull;
hostile reception.
<p>Consider the possibility of alleviating the negative response by offering &bull;
improvements to other terms and conditions.

<p>Introduction
<p>The critical and most demanding task that anyone concerned with reward will have to under-
take is that of developing and implementing new or revised reward systems that are mainly
concerned with total rewards, job evaluation, grade and pay structure design, contingent pay
and employee benefits. This is an exacting process of change management and it is where all
the knowledge and experience acquired in the different aspects of reward management as
covered in this book are put into practice to respond to new demands and circumstances.
<p>It is not enough to know what to do; it is just as necessary to know how to do it and even
more necessary to ensure that it has been done as it was supposed to have been done. This
means being absolutely clear about the objectives of the change, planning the change on
the basis of an analysis of the situation and a diagnosis of the causes of any problems,
involving people &ndash; managers and staff alike &ndash; in the change process, communicating to
them about what is happening and why. It also means ensuring that everyone acquires the
skills needed to manage the new processes and play a part in them. Finally it involves

<p>408 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>planning the implementation, managing the implementation process effectively, and
monitoring and evaluating outcomes to ensure that the objectives of the exercise have
been achieved.
<p>This chapter is mainly concerned with the overall process of developing reward systems, but it
includes examples of the specific approaches that can be used in two main areas for develop-
ment, namely job evaluation and the design of grade and pay structures. The development of
other aspects of the reward system is dealt with in the following chapters: total rewards Chapter
3, contingent pay schemes Chapter 10, point-factor evaluation schemes Chapter 16, grade and
pay structures Chapter 19, and flexible benefits Chapter 25.
<p>The task of developing and implementing reward
systems
<p>The task of development and implementation is a critical one because of the fast-moving
nature of the reward scene. It is necessary constantly to review the system to ensure that it is
meeting business needs and this frequently means innovating new or fundamentally revised
processes. Business and HR strategies change and the reward strategy must change accord-
ingly. This applies to all the main areas of reward management, namely: job evaluation, pay
structures, contingent pay and pensions and benefits. Job evaluation schemes decay in use and
do not fit new organizational arrangements, pay structures are no longer appropriate, contin-
gent pay schemes do not deliver what was expected from them and pension and benefit
schemes have to be changed to meet new legal and fiscal requirements, to cater for different
employee needs or to make them more affordable. The task starts with objective setting and
continues with processes of analysis, diagnosis, evaluation of alternatives and selection of the
most appropriate one, design or development, implementation and evaluation.
<p>Objective setting
<p>It is important at an early stage to be clear about the objectives of any initiative, to clarify what
is to be achieved and, after implementation, serve as a basis for evaluation. Broad objectives
may be formed at the beginning of the exercise but these are likely to be modified during the
project as more information on requirements is obtained and processed. The following are
some examples of reward development project objectives.
<p>BT
<p>At BT their objectives were expressed as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 409
<p>Use the full range of rewards (salary, bonus, benefits and recognition) to recruit and
retain the best people, and to encourage and reward achievement where actions and
behaviours are consistent with the BT values.
<p>Diageo
<p>The objectives at Diageo were to:
<p>support and enable the talent agenda; &bull;
<p>provide clear principles to enable reward decision making in the business; &bull;
<p>align the reward approach with Diageo business strategy; &bull;
<p>enable every employee to understand why they get paid what they get paid; &bull;
<p>have a customer service ethic that results in great execution. &bull;
<p>A finance sector company
<p>The objectives for their &lsquo;fresh approach to reward&rsquo; produced by a finance sector company
were:
<p>Change the emphasis from measuring the job and its accountabilities to recognizing the
person and the contribution they make to the business; reflect the way the organization
is changing by encouraging us to be more responsive to customers; improve reward for
excellent performance by freeing up salary ranges.
<p>Friends Provident
<p>The objectives at Friends Provident were to:
<p>match salaries directly to the market; &bull;
<p>give line managers greater accountability for staff salaries and career progression; &bull;
<p>increase the flexibility of pay arrangements at business unit level; &bull;
<p>facilitate a real and fundamental top-down change in corporate culture; &bull;
<p>reward the best performers by paying salaries above the market rate; &bull;
<p>manage salary costs; &bull;
<p>encourage greater accountability by staff for development of their own competencies. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>410 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Tesco
<p>At Tesco the objectives of introducing a broad-banded structure were to:
<p>achieve more flexibility in determining pay; &bull;
<p>develop a flatter, more flexible organization; &bull;
<p>reward staff for their contribution; &bull;
<p>link remuneration to responsibility and contribution; &bull;
<p>simplify career planning and job classification. &bull;
<p>The approach to development and implementation
<p>No initiative should be planned without making a business case for it. The extent to which it
will add value rather than create work should be assessed. A value-added approach means that
processes and schemes will not be introduced or updated without assessing the effect they are
expected to have on the engagement and performance of people, on the ability of the organi-
zation to recruit and keep the right sort of employees and, ultimately, on the results achieved
by the organization.
<p>Bearing this in mind, and against the background of a preliminary statement of objectives, the
approach to the development and implementation of reward systems should be evidence-
based, realistic about risks, costs and what can be achieved, focused on how it will be put into
effect, and positive about involving stakeholders and communicating information to them on
proposals and plans and how they will be affected by them.
<p>Evidence-based development
<p>Evidence-based development means considering what needs to be done by reference to an
analysis of the internal and external context and the strengths and weaknesses of the present
reward arrangements, benchmarking good practice elsewhere and consulting relevant research.
This leads to an assessment of requirements that means addressing questions such as:
<p>What are the aims of our reward practices? What do we want to achieve with them? &bull;
<p>What would successful reward practices look like? How would we know? What criteria &bull;
and measures can we use to assess their effectiveness?
<p>What evidence do we have to assess the current level of effectiveness and to highlight &bull;
the strongest and weakest aspects of the current rewards package?
<p>What information can we gather to inform that review and how do we relate financial &bull;
and non-financial information in making any assessment?</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 411
<p>What should we do in response to these findings? &bull;
<p>What level and type of change is appropriate? &bull;
<p>What are the objectives of the change in such terms as higher levels of engagement, and &bull;
how will we know they have been achieved?
<p>How do we pilot, test and implement any changes to maximize their chances of &bull;
success?
<p>How do we ensure continuing success in the future, and how should rewards respond &bull;
to further internal and external changes and developments?
<p>Issues and risk assessment
<p>A major overhaul of a reward system will raise a number of issues involving risks. These need
to be analysed, as in the example from a private sector company given in Table 27.1.
<p>Costs
<p>A new or substantially revised reward system is an investment. But the costs of that investment
need to be assessed to answer the question &lsquo;is it affordable?&rsquo; and thus provide the basis for
deciding whether or not the investment is worthwhile and indicate what can be done to contain
costs, and how costs will be controlled during the project.

<br>
<p>412 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Introducing a new grade structure will almost inevitably incur costs. This is because while the
pay of those who are over-graded (red-circled) will not be reduced, at least in the short term,
the pay of those who are under-graded (green-circled) will have to be increased immediately
or over two or at most three years. Respondents to the e-reward 2007 survey of grade and pay
structures who had introduced new structures indicated that the average proportion of
employees who were red-circled was 4.9 per cent and the proportion of those green-circled (ie
underpaid) was 13.2 per cent. Their costs of dealing with green-circled staff were as high as 8
per cent of pay roll, with an average of just over 2 per cent. It is prudent to assume a cost of 3&ndash;4
per cent.
<p>A reality check
<p>Any proposals or plans should be subjected to a reality check:
<p>Is it worth doing? &ndash; What return will we get on our investment? What&rsquo;s the business &bull;
case in terms of added value? What contribution will it make to supporting the achieve-
ment of the organization&rsquo;s strategic goals?
<p>Can it be done? &bull;
<p>Who does it? &bull;
<p>Have we the resources to do it? &bull;
<p>How do we manage the change? &bull;
<p>Planning for implementation
<p>It is normally assumed that the processes of development and implementation are sequential:
you develop something and then you implement it. This is a mistake. If constant thought is
not given during and throughout the development of a reward system on how it will work and
how it will be made to work, then the implementation will fail. The two go together. Imple-
mentation plans have to take account of the barriers to reward changes revealed in the research
conducted by Brown and Purcell (2007) as shown in Figure 27.1, especially those concerned
with the attitudes of line managers and staff, communications and line managers&rsquo; skills.
<p>The plan for implementation should cover:
<p>the use of pilot tests to identify any operational problems; &bull;
<p>the possibility of phasing the introduction of the changed system so that each step is &bull;
manageable in the time available;
<p>setting up a projects team with an experienced project manager; &bull;
<p>developing an involvement strategy &ndash; deciding who should be involved in the develop- &bull;
ment programme and how they should be involved;</p>

<p>Involvement
<p>Involve stakeholders from the word go &ndash; bottom up as well as top down. It is vital to get the
contribution of line managers, staff and employee representatives as well as senior manage-
ment at all stages of the project. Use attitude surveys, focus groups and workshops to obtain
views, explore issues and exchange ideas. The aim is to achieve ownership and acceptance of
the outcome of the project.
<p>Communication
<p>Effective communications are important because reward systems can be complex and difficult to
understand and therefore need to be explained carefully. Rewards are an emotive issue. So many
personal needs are tied up in them &ndash; for security, recognition, status and so on &ndash; that changes to
them almost inevitably generate emotional and often hostile responses from at least some employ-
ees. People can be suspicious about the reasons for change and feel that it will affect them adversely.
It may be difficult to overcome these fears but a sustained attempt must be made to do so.

<p>Developing Reward Systems 415
<p>Advice from practitioners
<p>The practical advice given below originates from e-reward research interviews (2003 to 2009).
<p>B&amp;Q
<p>B&amp;Q carried out a thorough investigation into the context of the organization &ndash; its internal
and external environment &ndash; and the characteristics of the existing reward system and the views
of all the relevant stakeholders. The aim was to get, via an in-depth research exercise, a full
understanding of the present arrangements, changing employment situation and future
requirements. The company gathered and marshalled data from two perspectives:
<p>External perspective
<p>The analysis of the external environment included:
<p>examination of the changing labour market; &bull;
<p>literature review of employers&rsquo; responses to emerging employment trends and how &bull;
competitors reward staff;
<p>an analysis of the HR and reward strategies typically adopted by high-performing &bull;
organizations;
<p>a survey of 50 high-performing people in a sample of 20 high-performing organiza- &bull;
tions, examining what these staff need in the reward package;
<p>two commissioned surveys of 200 people each to examine &lsquo;external&rsquo; perceptions of &bull;
B&amp;Q as an employer;
<p>a benchmarking exercise using retail industry salary. &bull;
<p>Internal perspective
<p>The analysis of the internal environment included:
<p>a full audit of the current reward investment and its focus; &bull;
<p>consideration of existing use of bonus schemes; &bull;
<p>examination of pay for performance arrangements; &bull;
<p>current provision of financial and non-financial rewards; &bull;
<p>findings of 20 focus groups comprising people from different levels of B&amp;Q and differ- &bull;
ent divisions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>416 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>To gain an understanding of employee needs and the rewards that motivate its people to
deliver results, B&amp;Q consulted its stakeholders. It canvassed the opinions of middle managers,
team leaders, line managers and store employees generally through a series of focus groups.
The company commissioned a total of 20 focus groups, each consisting of at least 10 people to
facilitate discussion. Their members were representative of the different activities and occupa-
tions in the organization.
<p>Will Astill, B&amp;Q&rsquo;s reward manager, recommends these guiding principles:
<p>Without cooperation change strategies are likely to fail. &bull;
<p>Secure directors&rsquo; &lsquo;buy-in&rsquo; right away. &bull;
<p>Never underestimate the value of in-depth employee consultation. &bull;
<p>Remember that strategy formulation is an evolutionary process. &bull;
<p>Look at how well you communicate your reward package. &bull;
<p>No initiative should be implemented without examining the return on investment. &bull;
<p>Evaluate the effectiveness of programmes and take action as required. &bull;
<p>Budget well in advance. &bull;
<p>A final word from Will Astill:
<p>An overriding theme running through our review was on the desirability of adopting a
strategic approach. It wasn&rsquo;t a case of &lsquo;let&rsquo;s follow best practice&rsquo;, nor were we lured into
adopting the latest &lsquo;fads&rsquo; and &lsquo;fashions&rsquo;. Applying a bespoke system &ndash; taking what
someone has done before and adapting it to your organization &ndash; will not push you
ahead of rivals. Our emphasis throughout the two-year process was on what&rsquo;s right for
the business.
<p>Implement and review &ndash; the BT approach
<p>Kevin Brady, HR Director, Reward and Employee Relations at BT made the following
suggestions:
<p>Business sponsorship and ownership is key &bull;
<p> Secure &lsquo;sponsorship and ownership&rsquo; amongst senior people &ndash; a feeling that the change
is something that they are happy to live with because they have been involved in its
planning and introduction &ndash; it has become their change.
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate resistance &bull;
<p> The level of resistance that may arise when reorganizing reward systems should never be
underestimated, hence the importance of sponsorship, communication and training.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 417
<p>Project management skills are critical &bull;
<p> The project must be carefully planned and managed under a skilled project manager.
<p>Engage, engage, engage! &bull;
<p> Ownership and acceptance are much more likely if the maximum degree of engage-
ment of all concerned is built into the entire change programme.
<p>Clear, consistent communications &bull;
<p> It is imperative to communicate clearly and consistently to staff at every stage of the
process.
<p>Centrica
<p>Centrica&rsquo;s nine success criteria for developing reward systems are:
<p>partnership; &bull;
<p>preparation; &bull;
<p>business engagement; &bull;
<p>employee engagement; &bull;
<p>union engagement; &bull;
<p>financial modelling; &bull;
<p>communications; &bull;
<p>project administration; &bull;
<p>business-as-usual administration. &bull;
<p>GlaxoSmithKline
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t expect people to change overnight and don&rsquo;t try to force change. It is better to
reinforce desirable behaviour than to attempt to enforce a particular way of doing
things&rsquo; (Paul Craven, Compensation Director, R&amp;D).
<p>Lloyds TSB
<p>When developing new reward systems Tim Fevyer, then Senior Manager, Compensation and
Benefits, recommended these guiding principles:
<p>The success of new reward systems depends heavily on talking to people, and asking &bull;
what they would like to see.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>418 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>It is imperative to communicate to staff at every stage of the process &ndash; even in advance &bull;
of launch &ndash; explaining the planned changes, the rationale behind them, and how it
affects the workforce. You then need to continue to give progress reports to employees
and obtain their input on an ongoing basis.
<p>The success of any total reward programme will hinge on the degree to which employ- &bull;
ees feel a sense of ownership &ndash; a feeling amongst people that the change is something
that they are happy to live with because they have been involved in its planning and
introduction &ndash; it has become their change.
<p>It&rsquo;s vital that you get pay right &ndash; otherwise much damage can be done. But once it is, &bull;
don&rsquo;t treat it like a sophisticated lever to influence motivation and empowerment. Pay
is no longer the great differentiator. The only way we are going to keep people is by
engaging them.
<p>Remember that reward processes can indeed underpin structural and cultural change &bull;
and support the achievement of business goals. But not on their own, and they do not
lead change.
<p>Although a fundamentally simple concept, nobody should pretend that total reward is &bull;
not a difficult and time-consuming process to put into practice.
<p>All reward initiatives should be prioritized &ndash; only those processes and schemes that are &bull;
expected to generate the greatest value should be introduced.
<p>A final word from Tim Fevyer:
<p>You cannot succeed without focusing on business goals and understanding what these
mean for your core people goals. Shareholder value was our ultimate objective. But we
unbundled this objective and examined how we would generate shareholder value
through our reward strategy. We wanted to recruit, retain and engage good people. You
might do that in the short term by throwing more money at people but we wanted a
long-term solution that really focused on the individual and their contribution within
the business. Meeting individual needs by providing flexibility within a framework has
enabled us to generate significant value for both employees and the company.
<p>Tesco
<p>Richard Sullivan, Tesco&rsquo;s group reward manager, recommends that managers should keep in
mind these guiding principles:
<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the old culture &ndash; it will take time to change it. &bull;
<p>Be prepared to challenge any return to the old ways. &bull;
<p>Management capability is key to communicating issues. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Developing Reward Systems 419
<p>Employee communication is key to having the new system understood. &bull;
<p>Obtain managers&rsquo; input when designing the new process; this will help them explain it &bull;
to others and will increase their commitment to it.
<p>Duncan Brown
<p>Interviews conducted in 2009 by Duncan Brown, Director of the Institute for Employment
Studies (Armstrong, Brown and Reilly, forthcoming), produced the following comments:
<p>You can&rsquo;t adopt a market-based, &lsquo;must be&rsquo; approach. Pay attention to the organiza-
tion, its culture and its needs, gather information and evidence for (reward) change,
but help managers to understand, support and make those changes (a Head of Reward
and Development in a software company).
<p>In a service-driven organization like ours, with lots of professional people, if you come
up with a grand master-plan, people will find 53 reasons why they can&rsquo;t do it. You have
to change more subtly, helping them to see the connections and support it, introducing
change &lsquo;under and up&rsquo; rather than down from the top. People now totally buy into the
behaviours and indicators we have developed (Liz Booth, Director of Human Resources,
NSPCC).
<p>Reward symposium
<p>A symposium of reward specialists as reported by Sandringham (2000) produced the follow-
ing suggestions on developing reward systems that work:
<p>Align your system with the culture of the organization. &bull;
<p>Be careful about generalizations: segmenting staff in the way you segment customers &bull;
may allow you to target your reward system better.
<p>Look at the whole bundle of reward, not just pay; people leave because the job is not &bull;
satisfying or interesting, or because they feel their boss is treating them badly.</p>

<p>Introduction
<p>Reward management involves the management of complex systems. This is a demanding task
requiring the formulation and implementation of policies, control, monitoring and evalua-
tion, pay reviews, procedures, using computers and communicating to employees as explained
in this chapter. The starting point is a clear set of policies.
<p>Reward policies
<p>Reward policies set specific guidelines for decision making and action and therefore provide
the framework for managing a reward system. They indicate what the organization and its
management are expected to do about managing reward and how they will behave in given
circumstances when dealing with reward issues. They can be distinguished from guiding prin-
ciples, which usually express a more generalized philosophy. The key reward policy areas are
described below.
<p>Level of rewards
<p>The policy on the level of rewards indicates whether the company is a high payer, is
content to pay median or average rates of pay or even, exceptionally, accepts that it has to
pay below the average. Pay policy, which is sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;pay stance&rsquo; or
&lsquo;pay posture&rsquo; of a company, will depend on a number of factors. These include the extent
to which the company demands high levels of performance from its employees, the degree </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 423
<p>to which there is competition for good-quality people, the traditional stance of the
company, the organization culture, and whether or not it can or should afford to be a high
payer. A firm may say that, &lsquo;We will pay upper quartile salaries because we want our staff
to be upper quartile performers.&rsquo;
<p>Policies on pay levels will also refer to differentials and the number of steps or grades that
should exist in the pay hierarchy. This will be influenced by the structure of the company.
In today&rsquo;s flatter organizations an extended or complex pay hierarchy may not be required
on the grounds that it does not reflect the way in which work is organized and will constrain
flexibility.
<p>Policies on the level of rewards also cover employee benefits &ndash; pensions, sick pay, health care,
holidays and perks such as company cars.
<p>External competitiveness versus internal equity
<p>A policy needs to be formulated on the extent to which rewards are market driven rather than
equitable. This policy will be influenced by the culture and reward philosophies of the organi-
zation and the pressures on the business to obtain and keep high-quality staff. Any organiza-
tions that have to attract and retain staff who are much in demand and where market rates are
therefore high, may, to a degree, have to sacrifice their ideals (if they have them) of internal
equity to the realism of the market place. They will provide &lsquo;market pay&rsquo;; in other words, they
will be &lsquo;market driven&rsquo;.
<p>The pay management process must cope as best it can when the irresistible force of market
pressures meets the immovable object of internal equity. There will always be some degree of
tension in these circumstances, and while no solution will ever be simple or entirely satisfac-
tory, there is one basic principle that can enhance the likelihood of success. That principle is
to make explicit and fully identifiable the compromises with internal equity that are made and
have to be made in response to market pressures.
<p>The policy may indicate that market considerations will drive levels of pay in the organization.
It may, however, allow for the use of market supplements &ndash; a payment that reflects market
rates in addition to the rate for a job as determined by internal equity . The policy may lay
down that these payments should be reviewed regularly and no longer offered if they are
unnecessary. Market supplements for those who have them may not be withdrawn (the people
concerned would not lose pay), but adjustments may be made to pay progression to bring
their rates more into line with those for comparable jobs. Market pay and market supplements
can lead to gender inequalities if, as is often the case, men in comparable jobs are paid more
generally or more men get market supplements than women. Equal pay case law has ruled that
market pay and market supplements should be &lsquo;objectively justified&rsquo;, and the requirement to
do this should be included in the pay policy.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>424 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>The 2007 e-reward survey of grade and pay structures revealed that respondents with market
supplements adopted the following policies when such supplements were no longer required:
<p>remove immediately &ndash; 33 per cent; &bull;
<p>retain until upgraded &ndash; 30 per cent; &bull;
<p>reduce progressively &ndash; 19 per cent; &bull;
<p>protect in line with policy &ndash; 18 per cent. &bull;
<p>Segmentation
<p>Segmentation involves varying the reward package for different jobs or to reflect the types and
levels of contribution people make, or providing rewards that are tailored to meet individual
needs.
<p>A policy on segmentation will recognize that parts of the workforce and individuals in the suc-
cessive stages of their career may be motivated by different combinations of rewards. A total
rewards package can be tailored to meet these needs. Rewards may be segmented to take
account of key employee differences. This could mean individual performance-related pay for
some, team reward for others, and other forms of pay progression and recognition rather than
incentives for a third group. This is a flexible approach to reward management although it
should be flexibility within a framework, the framework being provided by guiding principles
that apply to all aspects of reward.
<p>Assimilation policies
<p>The introduction of a new or considerably revised pay structure means that policies have to be
developed on how existing employees should be assimilated into it. These policies cover where
people should be placed in their new grades and what happens to them if their new grade and
pay range means that their existing rate is above or below the new scale for their job. The
policy should therefore cover &lsquo;red-circling&rsquo; (identifying and dealing with overpaid people) and
&lsquo;green-circling&rsquo; (identifying and dealing with underpaid people). In the case of red-circled
staff, &lsquo;protection&rsquo; policies may have to be formulated to safeguard their existing rates of pay.
In the case of green-circled staff, the policy may have to determine when (not if) their pay
should be increased to fit into the new scale. It is sometimes necessary to save costs by phasing
the increase, and this should be included as a possible policy.
<p>Protection policies
<p>Protection (sometimes called safeguarding) is the process of dealing with the situation when,
following the introduction of a new pay structure, the existing pay of some employees may be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 425
<p>above the maximum for their new grade and they are therefore &lsquo;red-circled&rsquo;. In these circum-
stances the general rule is that no one should suffer a reduction in their present rate of pay.
Beyond this, the issues are what exactly is to be protected and whether or not the protection
should be for a limited period, and if so, for how long.
<p>The usual approach is to allow staff to continue to earn any increments to which they are
entitled under existing arrangements up to the maximum of their present scale. They are
also entitled to receive any across-the-board (cost of living) increases awarded to staff gen-
erally for the protection period, if it is limited, or for as long as they remain in their present
job if there is no limit (in the latter case they are on what is sometimes called a &lsquo;personal to
job holder&rsquo; scale). If the period is limited, they will no longer be entitled to general increases
after the limit has been reached until their rate of pay falls within the new scale for their job.
They will then be entitled to the same increases as any other staff in their grade. When the
individual concerned leaves the job, the scale of pay for the job reverts to the standard range
as set up following job evaluation.
<p>The argument for limiting the protection period is that, unless this is done, equal pay prob-
lems may arise because an inequitable differential will have been perpetuated. The Equal
Opportunities Commission (EOC) in its Good Practice Guide on Job Evaluation Schemes
Free of Sex Bias, stated that red-circling &lsquo;should not be used on such a scale that it amounts to
sex discrimination&rsquo;. And as suggested by the Equal Pay Task Force: &lsquo;The use of red or green
circling which maintains a difference in pay between men and women over more than a phase-
in period of time will be difficult to justify.&rsquo;
<p>The respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey of grade and pay structures adopted the follow-
ing protection periods:
<p>unlimited &ndash; 53 per cent; &bull;
<p>one year &ndash; 12 per cent; &bull;
<p>two years &ndash; 10 per cent; &bull;
<p>three years &ndash; 6 per cent; &bull;
<p>four years &ndash; 15 per cent; &bull;
<p>five to ten years &ndash; 4 per cent. &bull;
<p>The role of line managers
<p>The extent to which the responsibility for rewards should be devolved to line managers is a
policy decision. The aim may be to devolve it as far as possible, bearing in mind the need to
ensure that other reward policy guidelines are followed and that consistent decisions are made
across the organization by line managers. The policy may cover the level of decisions managers </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>426 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>can make, the guidance that should be made available to them and how consistency will be
achieved.
<p>Transparency
<p>Traditionally, organizations in the private sector have kept information about pay policies
secret. This is no longer a tenable position. Without transparency, people will believe that the
organization has something to hide, often with reason. There is no chance of building a satis-
factory psychological contract unless the organization spells out its reward policies and prac-
tices. Transparency is achieved through involvement and communication.
<p>Controlling reward
<p>The implementation of reward policies and procedures should be monitored and controlled
to ensure that value for money is obtained. Control is easier if the grade and pay structure is
well defined and clear guidelines exist on how it and the benefits arrangements should be
managed. Control should be based on forecasts, budgets and costings, as described below, and
by monitoring and evaluating the implementation of reward policies as discussed in the next
part of this chapter.
<p>Reward forecasts
<p>It is necessary to forecast future payroll costs taking into account the number of people
employed and the impact of pay reviews and contingent pay awards. The cost implications of
developments such as a revised job evaluation scheme, a new grade and pay structure or a flex-
ible benefits scheme also have to be forecast.
<p>Reward budgets
<p>Pay review budgets set out the increase in payroll costs that will result for either general or
individual pay reviews and are used for cost forecasts generally and as the basis for the guide-
lines issued to line managers on conducting individual reviews.
<p>Total payroll budgets are based on the number of people employed in different jobs and their
present and forecast rates of pay. In a budgetary control system they are aggregated from the
budgets prepared by departmental managers but HR provides guidance on the allowances that
should be made for pay increases. The aim is to maintain control over payroll costs and restrain
managers from the temptation to overpay their staff.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 427
<p>Costing reward processes
<p>Proposed changes to the reward system need to be costed for approval by senior management.
The costs would include development costs such as consultants&rsquo; fees, software, literature,
additional staff and, possibly, the opportunity costs arising when staff are seconded to a devel-
opment project.
<p>Implementation costs also have to be projected. A new grade and pay structure, for example,
can easily result in an increase to the payroll of 3&ndash;4 per cent. New contingent pay schemes may
also cost more, although the aim should be to make them self-financing.
<p>Monitoring and evaluating reward policies and
practices
<p>The effectiveness of reward policies and practices should be monitored and evaluated against
the requirements of the organization. Monitoring is carried out through compa-ratio analysis,
attrition analysis, assessing added value and the use of attitude surveys. Evaluation, as described
in more detail in Chapter 29, should compare outcomes with the objectives set for the new
practice (this is why setting objectives for reward initiatives is so important).
<p>Compa-ratio analysis
<p>A compa-ratio (short for &lsquo;comparative ratio&rsquo;) measures the relationship in a graded pay struc-
ture between actual and policy rates of pay as a percentage. The policy value used is the mid-
point or reference point in a pay range, which represents the &lsquo;target rate&rsquo; for a fully competent
individual in any job in the grade. This point is aligned with market rates in accordance with
the organization&rsquo;s market stance (its policy on the relationship between its levels of pay and
market rates).
<p>Compa-ratios can be used to define the extent to which pay policy is achieved (the relationship
between the policy and actual rates of pay). The analysis of compa-ratios indicates what action
may have to be taken to slow down or accelerate increases if compa-ratios are too high or too
low compared with the policy level. This is sometimes called &lsquo;mid-point management&rsquo;.
Compa-ratios can also be used to measure where an individual is placed in a pay range, and
therefore provide information on the size of pay increases when a pay matrix is used, as
described later in this chapter.
<p>Compa-ratios are calculated as follows:
<p>actual rate of pay
mid or reference point of range
<p>&times; 100</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>428 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>A compa-ratio of 100 per cent means that actual pay and policy pay are the same. Compa-
ratios that are higher or lower than 100 per cent mean that, respectively, pay is above or below
the policy target rate. For example, if the target (policy) rate in a range were &pound;20,000 and the
average pay of all the individuals in the grade were &pound;18,000, the compa-ratio would be 90 per
cent. Compa-ratios establish differences between policy and practice. The reasons for such
differences need to be established.
<p>Analysing attrition
<p>Attrition or slippage takes place when employees enter jobs at lower rates of pay than the pre-
vious incumbents. If this happens payroll costs will go down, given an even flow of starters and
leavers and a consistent approach to the determination of rates of pay. In theory attrition can
help to finance pay increases within a range. It has been claimed that fixed incremental systems
can be entirely self-financing because of attrition, but the conditions under which this can
happen are so exceptional that it probably never happens.
<p>Attrition can be calculated by the formula: total percentage increase to payroll arising from
general or individual pay increases minus total percentage increase in average rates of pay. If
it can be proved that attrition is going to take place, the amount involved can be taken into
account as a means of at least partly financing individual pay increases. Attrition in a pay
system with regular progression through ranges and a fairly even flow of starters and leavers is
typically between 2 per cent and 3 per cent, but this should not be regarded as a norm.
<p>Assessing added value
<p>Assessing the added value or value for money provided by existing practices, or by new prac-
tices when they are implemented, is a major consideration when monitoring and evaluating
reward management processes. Evaluating the cost of innovations may lead to the reconsid-
eration of proposals in order to ensure that they will provide added value. Evaluating the value
for money obtained from existing reward practices leads to the identification of areas for
improvement.
<p>Affordability should be a major issue when reviewing reward management developments and
existing practices. Added value is achieved when the benefits of a reward practice either exceed
its cost or at least justify the cost. At the development stage it is therefore necessary to carry out
cost&ndash;benefit assessments. The two fundamental questions to be answered are: 1) &lsquo;What busi-
ness needs will this proposal meet?&rsquo; and 2) &lsquo;How will the proposal meet the needs?&rsquo; The costs
and benefits of existing practices should also be assessed on the same basis.</p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 429
<p>Attitude surveys
<p>An attitude survey is a valuable means of evaluating and monitoring reward practices by
assessing the views of those at the receiving end of pay policies as a basis for taking action. An
example of a reward attitude survey is given in Appendix A.
<p>Conducting pay reviews
<p>Pay reviews are general or &lsquo;across-the-board&rsquo; reviews in response to movements in the cost of
living or market rates, or following pay negotiations with trade unions or individual reviews
that determine the pay progression of individuals in relation to their performance or contri-
bution. They are one of the most visible aspects of reward management (the other is job
grading) and are an important means of implementing the organization&rsquo;s reward policies and
demonstrating to employees how these policies operate.
<p>Employees expect that general reviews will maintain the purchasing power of their pay by
compensating for increases in the cost of living. They will want their levels of pay to be com-
petitive with what they could earn elsewhere. And they will want to be rewarded fairly and
equitably for the contribution they make.
<p>General reviews
<p>General reviews take place when employees are given an increase in response to general market
rate movements, increases in the cost of living, or union negotiations. General reviews are
often combined with individual reviews but employees are usually informed of both the
general and individual components of any increase they receive. Alternatively the general
review may be conducted separately to enable better control to be achieved over costs and to
focus employees&rsquo; attention on the performance-related aspect of their remuneration.
<p>Some organizations have completely abandoned the use of across-the-board reviews. They
argue that the decision on what people should be paid should be an individual matter, taking
into account the personal contribution people are making and their &lsquo;market worth&rsquo; &ndash; how
they as individuals are valued in the market place. This enables the organization to adopt a
more flexible approach to allocating pay increases in accordance with the perceived value of
individuals to the organization.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>430 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>The steps required to conduct a general review
<p>1. Decide on the budget.
<p>2. Analyse data on pay settlements made by comparable organizations and rates of
inflation.
<p>3. Conduct negotiations with trade unions as required.
<p>4. Calculate costs.
<p>5. Adjust the pay structure &ndash; by either increasing the pay brackets of each grade by
the percentage general increase, or by increasing pay reference points by the
overall percentage and applying different increases to the upper or lower limits of
the bracket, thus altering the shape of the structure.
<p>6. Inform employees.
<p>Individual reviews
<p>Individual pay reviews determine contingent pay increases or bonuses. The e-reward 2004
survey of contribution pay found that the average size of the contingent pay awards made by
respondents was 3.5 per cent (it was 3.3 per cent in 2004). Individual awards may be based on
ratings; an overall assessment that does not depend on ratings or ranking as discussed below.
<p>Individual pay reviews based on ratings
<p>Managers propose increases on the basis of their performance management ratings within a given
pay review budget and in accordance with pay review guidelines. Eighty per cent of the respondents
to the e-reward 2009 survey of contingent pay used ratings to inform contingent pay decisions.
<p>There is a choice of methods. The simplest way is to have a direct link between the rating and
the pay increase; for example:
<p>Rating Increase (%)
<p>A 6
<p>B 4
<p>C 3
<p>D 2
<p>E 0</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 431
<p>This approach was used by 36 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey.
<p>A more sophisticated approach is to use a pay matrix, as illustrated in Table 28.1. This indi-
cates the percentage increase payable for different performance ratings according to the posi-
tion of the individual&rsquo;s pay in the pay range. This is sometimes referred to as an &lsquo;individual
compa-ratio&rsquo; and expresses pay as a percentage of the mid-point in a range. A compa-ratio of
100 per cent means that the salary would be at the mid-point.
<p>This approach was used by 41 per cent of the respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey.
<p>Linking pay reviews to performance reviews
<p>Many people argue that linking performance management too explicitly to pay prejudices the
essential developmental nature of performance management. However, realistically, it is
accepted that decisions on performance-related or contribution-related increases have to be
based on some form of assessment. One solution is to &lsquo;decouple&rsquo; performance management
and the pay review by holding them several months apart, and 47 per cent of the respondents
to the e-reward 2009 survey did this. There is still a read-across but it is not so immediate.
Some try to do without formulaic approaches (ratings and pay matrices) altogether, although
it is impossible to dissociate contingent pay completely from some form of assessment.
<p>Table 28.1 A pay matrix
<p>Percentage pay increase according to performance rating and position
in pay range (compa-ratio)
<p>Rating Position in pay range
<p>80%&ndash;90% 91%&ndash;100% 101%&ndash;110% 111%&ndash;120%
<p>Excellent 12% 10% 8% 6%
<p>Very effective 10% 8% 6% 4%
<p>Effective 6% 4% 3% 0
<p>Developing 4% 3% 0 0
<p>Ineligible 0 0 0 0</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>432 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>Doing without ratings
<p>Twenty per cent of the respondents to the 2009 e-reward survey of contingent pay did without
ratings. One respondent to the e-reward survey explained that in the absence of ratings, the
approach used was &lsquo;informed subjectivity&rsquo;, which meant considering ongoing performance in
the form of overall contribution.
<p>Some companies adopt what might be called a holistic approach. Managers propose where
people should be placed in the pay range for their grade, taking into account their contribu-
tion and pay relative to others in similar jobs, their potential and the relationship of their
current pay to market rates. The decision may be expressed in the form of a statement that an
individual is now worth &pound;30,000 rather than &pound;28,000. The increase is 7 per cent, but what
counts is the overall view about the value of a person to the organization, not the percentage
increase to that person&rsquo;s pay.
<p>Ranking
<p>Ranking is carried out by managers who place staff in a rank order according to an overall
assessment of relative contribution or merit and then distribute performance ratings through
the rank order. The top 10 per cent could get an A rating, the next 15 per cent a B rating and
so on. The ratings determine the size of the reward. A forced ranking or &lsquo;vitality curve&rsquo; system
may be used to compel managers to conform to predetermined proportions of staff in each
grade. But ranking depends on fair, consistent and equitable assessments, which cannot be
guaranteed, and assumes that there is some sort of standard distribution of ability across the
organization, which may not be the case.
<p>Guidelines to managers on conducting individual pay reviews
<p>Whichever approach is adopted, guidelines have to be issued to managers on how they
should conduct reviews. These guidelines will stipulate that they must keep within their
budgets and may indicate the maximum and minimum increases that can be awarded with
an indication of how awards could be distributed. For example, when the budget is 4 per
cent overall, it might be suggested that a 3 per cent increase should be given to the majority
of staff and the others given higher or lower increases as long as the total percentage increase
does not exceed the budget. Managers in some companies are instructed that they must
follow a forced pattern of distribution (a forced choice system) but only 8 per cent of the
respondents to the 2003 CIPD survey (Armstrong and Baron, 2004) used this method. To
help them to explore alternatives, managers may be provided with a spreadsheet facility in
which the spreadsheets contain details of the existing rates of staff and can be used to model
alternative distributions on a &lsquo;what if&rsquo; basis. Managers may also be encouraged to &lsquo;fine tune&rsquo;
their pay recommendations to ensure that individuals are on the right track within their
grade according to their level of performance, competence and time in the job compared </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 433
<p>with their peers. To do this, they need guidelines on typical rates of progression in relation
to performance, skill or competence, and specific guidance on what they can and should do.
They also need information on the relative positions of their staff in the pay structure in
relation to the policy guidelines.
<p>Conducting individual pay reviews
<p>Steps required to conduct individual pay reviews
<p>1. Agree budget.
<p>2. Prepare and issue guidelines on the size, range and distribution of awards and on
methods of conducting the review.
<p>3. Provide advice and support.
<p>4. Review proposals against budget and guidelines and agree modifications to them if
necessary.
<p>5. Summarize and cost proposals and obtain approval.
<p>6. Update payroll.
<p>7. Inform employees.
<p>A description of how a company makes individual pay decisions is given below.
<p>Making pay decisions in a finance sector company
<p>We look at a number of things when making a decision on an individual&rsquo;s pay. One
will be the size of the role as determined by job evaluation, and we also consider
market data and location to determine the average salary that you would expect to pay
for that role. We then look at how the individual has performed over the last 12
months: Have they contributed what was expected of them? Have they contributed
above and beyond their peers? Have they underperformed in respect of what was
required of them? These are not ratings, they are just guidelines given to managers as
to whether the individual should be given an average, above-average or below-average
increase. We have a devolved budget and managers have to make decisions as to what
percentage they should give to different people. We suggest that if, for example, a
manager has six people carrying out the same roles then, from an equal pay point of
view, if they are delivering at the same level and are all competent, they should be
getting similar salaries. Individuals paid below the market rate who are performing
effectively may get a bigger pay rise to bring them nearer the market rate for the role.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>434 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>It is essential to provide advice, guidance and training to line managers as required. Some
managers will be confident and capable from the start. Others will have a lot to learn.
<p>Reward procedures
<p>Reward procedures deal with grading jobs, fixing rates of pay and handling appeals.
<p>Grading jobs
<p>The procedures for grading jobs set out how job evaluation should be used to grade a new job
or re-grade an existing one. A point-factor evaluation scheme that has defined grades may be
used for all new jobs and to deal with requests for re-grading. However, an analytical matching
process (see Chapter 16) may be used to compare the role profiles of the jobs to be graded with
grade or level profiles or profiles of benchmark jobs. This is likely to be the case in large organ-
izations and for broad-banded structures.
<p>Fixing rates of pay on appointment
<p>The procedure should indicate how much freedom line managers and HR have to pay above
the minimum rate for the job. The freedom may be limited to, say, 10 per cent above the
minimum or two or three pay points on an incremental scale. More scope is sometimes
allowed to respond to market rate pressures or to attract particularly well-qualified staff by
paying up to the reference point or target salary in a pay range, subject to HR approval and
bearing in mind the need to provide scope for contingent pay increases. If recruitment supple-
ments or premia are used the rules for offering them to candidates must be clearly defined.
<p>Promotion increases
<p>The procedure will indicate what is regarded as a meaningful increase on promotion, often 10
per cent or more. To avoid creating anomalies, the level of pay has to take account of what
other people are paid who are carrying out work at a similar level, and it is usual to lay down
a maximum level that does not take the pay of the promoted employee above the reference
point for the new range.
<p>Appeals
<p>It is customary to include the right to appeal against gradings as part of a job evaluation pro-
cedure. Appeals against pay decisions are usually made through the organization&rsquo;s grievance
procedure.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 435
<p>The use of computers in reward management
<p>The ever-evolving world of IT and electronic communications has changed the way salary
data are reviewed and managed quite radically in the last decade. Applications and data can
now be accessed and assessed from almost anywhere in the world; organizations are making
increasing use of the internet, data on market rates and pay settlements is published on the
internet and users can communicate at speed through e-mail. Computers and the software
are becoming more and more powerful and sophisticated. HR or reward specialists can
analyse the implications of new grade structures, cost pay review matrices and plan salary
reviews, and options can rapidly be costed through simple changes on a spreadsheet. &lsquo;Self-
serve&rsquo; systems enable line management to carry out a number of reward tasks, such as pay
reviews. Increasing use is being made of computers to support reward administration and
decision making in the areas of:
<p>providing a reward database; &bull;
<p>job evaluation; &bull;
<p>grade and pay structure modelling; &bull;
<p>pay review modelling; &bull;
<p>equal pay reviews. &bull;
<p>The reward database
<p>The reward database stores data on employees&rsquo; pay, earnings and benefits so that it can be
updated, processed and communicated as information to users. It consists of systematically
organized and interrelated sets of files (collections of records serving as the basic unit of data
storage) and allows for combinations of data to be selected as required by different users. The
database contains information imported from the payroll or personnel information system.
This information may include personal and job details, job grade, basic pay, position in the
pay range (compa-ratio), earnings through variable pay, pay history (progression, and general
and individual pay increases), performance management ratings, details of employee benefits,
pension contributions, contributions to Save as You Earn schemes and the choices made
under a flexible benefits system, including pension contributions.
<p>The database can be used, for example, to:
<p>Produce listings of employees by job category, job grade, rate of pay, position in range &bull;
and size in actual or percentage terms of the last increase and, if required, previous
individual performance pay increases.
<p>Generate reports analysing distributions of pay by grade, including compa-ratios &bull;
for each grade and the organization as a whole. Extracts from these reports can be </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>436 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>downloaded to the personal computers of managers responsible for pay decisions
to assist them in conducting pay reviews.
<p>Initiate and print notifications of pay increases and update the payroll database. &bull;
<p>Use electronic mail facilities to transmit data. &bull;
<p>In using the database it is necessary that the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 are
met. Among other things, this requires that personal data held for any purpose should not be
used or disclosed in any manner incompatible with that purpose, and appropriate security
measures must be taken against unauthorized access to or disclosure of those data. If data are
going to be downloaded it will be essential to control who gets what. The importance of data
protection will also have to be spelt out to managers.
<p>Computer-aided job evaluation
<p>Computers can be used to help directly with job evaluation processes, as described in
Chapter 16.
<p>Software packages
<p>Micro-based software packages have been developed to carry out the various processes referred
to above. Proprietary software is usually designed as a standard software shell within which
there are a number of functions that allow users to customize the system to meet their own
needs.
<p>Grade and pay structure modelling
<p>Software packages available from firms such as Link Consultants and Pilat UK use the output
from a computerized job evaluation exercise contained in the database to model alternative
grade structures by reference to the distribution of points scores against the existing pay
rates for the jobs covered by job evaluation. The computer produces a scattergram and a
trend line showing the relationship between pay and the job evaluation scores. The pro-
gramme will then enable a proposed grade structure to be superimposed on the scattergram,
identifying those jobs above or below the new grade boundaries. The cost of bringing the
pay of those below the new boundaries to the minimum rate for their new grades is then
calculated by the computer.
<p>Alternative grade configurations can then be superimposed on the scattergram to find out if
the number of jobs below the lower limits of their new grades will be reduced. The computer
then calculates the lower costs of bringing the fewer jobs which are now below the minimum
up to the minimum. This modelling process can continue until the optimum configuration of
grades from the point of view of costs is achieved. A decision can then be made about whether </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Managing Reward Systems 437
<p>this grade structure or one of the others should be selected. The lowest-cost option would not
necessarily be chosen as it might produce an unmanageable grade structure, for example
having too few grades with too much scope for pay progression within them.
<p>Pay review modelling
General reviews
<p>The computer can use the database to provide information on the total cost of a proposed
general pay review and the effect this will have on other costs, for example pensions. The
program can then model alternative levels. Computers can model the effect on costs of alter-
native increases.
<p>Individual reviews
<p>It is now increasingly typical to manage pay reviews for an organization on a spreadsheet,
through which a number of alternative options can be tested. Spreadsheets provide line man-
agers with a worksheet, divided into cells, into which can be inserted text, numbers or formu-
lae. This allows the user to carry out complex &lsquo;what if&rsquo; analyses of the impact on the pay review
budget of alternative distributions of awards to staff. Analyses can be saved as a separate file for
future recall when the proposals are approved. Spreadsheets can be printed out in report or
graphical form. In some organizations, line managers carry out the modelling themselves
using a spreadsheet with data provided by HR, and their conclusions can be reviewed and
approved and aggregated into an overall cost of the review analysed by departments. In others,
HR and reward specialists carry out salary reviews for each function or department with the
relevant line managers on-site, using a laptop.
<p>The problem with spreadsheets is that they can be quite complex and do not always work well
in larger applications. Software such as the Pay Modeller marketed by Link Consultants may
be the answer to these problems.
<p>Equal pay reviews
<p>Software is available to support equal pay reviews and analyses. These range from database
tools that enable data to be imported from a range of sources to generate pay gap analyses,
such as the e-Review Equal Pay toolkit, to more sophisticated tools that allow for a broader
range of analysis possibilities using different data cuts, including the tool developed by Link.
<p>Communicating to employees
<p>Transparency is important. Employees need to know how reward policies will affect them and
how pay and grading decisions have been made. They need to be convinced that the system is </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>438 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>fair. They should also be given information on the value of their total reward package. But bear
in mind that as Erickson (2004) pointed out: &lsquo;Employees won&rsquo;t hear unless they feel they&rsquo;re
being listened to &ndash; no matter how professionally you handle top-down communications.&rsquo;
<p>Communicating to employees collectively
<p>Employees and their representatives should be informed about the guiding principles and
policies that underpin the reward system and the reward strategies that drive it. They should
understand the grade and pay structure, how grading decisions are made, including the job
evaluation system, how their pay can progress within the structure, the basis upon which con-
tingent pay increases are determined and policies on the provision of benefits, including details
of a flexible benefits scheme if one is available.
<p>Communicating to individual employees
<p>Individual employees should understand how their grade, present rate of pay and pay increases
have been determined, and the pay opportunities available to them &ndash; the scope for pay pro-
gression and how their contribution will be assessed through performance management. They
should be informed of the value of the benefits they receive so that they are aware of their total
remuneration and, if appropriate, how they can exercise choice over the range or scale of their
benefits through a flexible benefits scheme.
<p>As many means as possible should be used to communicate to employees. Possible methods
include:
<p>individual briefings; &bull;
<p>team briefings; &bull;
<p>road shows and open days; &bull;
<p>intranet, including bulletin boards; &bull;

<p>Introduction
<p>A cold economic climate makes it more essential than ever to obtain value for money from
investment in any HR activity. This particularly applies to reward, which is the most expensive
of them all. The best-performing firms, as established by Watson Wyatt (2002), make greater
efforts than others to measure reward plan effectiveness.
<p>The CIPD 2009 reward management survey found that only 32 per cent of the respondents
assess the impact of their reward practices and no more than 54 per cent could calculate the
size of their total remuneration spend (pay, benefits and other financial rewards plus National
Insurance Contributions). Just 12 per cent of respondents to the e-reward 2009 survey of con-
tingent pay evaluate the effectiveness of their individual performance-related pay schemes, a
remarkably low proportion considering the cost of such schemes and the problems of making
them work well.
<p>In their research on the evaluation of changes in pay structures, amongst 15 large employers
Corby et al (2003) found that only one organization made any real attempt systematically to
evaluate the effectiveness of the changes, and most managers were cynical about the value of
attempting to do so. The researchers established that &lsquo;significant decisions are the outcomes of
<p>440 </p>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 441
<p>a social and political process only partly shaped by the evidence.&rsquo; Rather than spending time
and incurring the cost of carrying out detailed monitoring, which would not provide conclu-
sive results, the research indicated that managers often relied on anecdotal evidence. They
used an approach to evaluation categorized by Kearns (1995) as &lsquo;we think it worked.&rsquo;
<p>In his classic 1995 article &lsquo;On the folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B&rsquo;, Steven Kerr com-
mented that: &lsquo;Managers who complain about lack of motivation in their workers might do
well to consider the possibility that the reward systems they have installed are paying off for
behaviours other than what they are seeking.&rsquo;
<p>Other researchers and commentators have come to broadly similar conclusions:
<p>The study found that few, if any, employers, built in a monitoring and evaluation
process as part of the introduction of an individual performance-related pay scheme.
This was because most employers did not have clearly articulated objectives for intro-
ducing such schemes against which they could measure subsequent success or failure.
Furthermore, little thought appeared to [be given to] the indicators that could be used
to measure the effectiveness of the scheme and the type of information that should be
collected. (Thompson, 1992)
<p>Little evidence demonstrates the efficacy of rewards, although much evidence indicates
that rewards and their design loom large in management attention. (Pfeffer, 1998)
<p>Compensation is a complex and often confusing topic. Although compensation costs
comprise, on average, 65 per cent to 70 per cent of total costs in the US economy and are
likewise substantial elsewhere, most managers are not sure of the likely consequences of
spending either more, or less on employees or of paying employees in different ways.
(Gerhart and Rynes, 2003)
<p>There are no less than six substitutes that managers often use for the best evidence;
&lsquo;obsolete knowledge, personal experience, specialist skills, hype, dogma and mindless
mimicry of top performers&rsquo;. (Pfeffer and Sutton, 2006)
<p>Why evaluate?
<p>Vast amounts of money are being wasted on pay and benefits but organizations are not getting
added value from this expenditure because they are not measuring the effectiveness of their
reward practices. While the literature and practice in the area of, for example, learning and
development, is replete with models and debates regarding the best methodology to apply to
judge &lsquo;the ROI on training&rsquo;, the reward literature is remarkably silent on this issue.
<p>The reasons for evaluating the effectiveness of reward policies and practices are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>442 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>to establish whether reward innovations are functioning as planned and achieving the &bull;
objectives set for them;
<p>to find out how well the established reward practices are working and identify any &bull;
problems;
<p>to ensure that value for money is obtained from the different parts of the reward &bull;
system;
<p>to provide an evidence-based approach to improving reward practices. &bull;
<p>Why don&rsquo;t people evaluate?
<p>Possible reasons for the lack of interest in evaluation include:
<p>The problem of isolating pay and rewards to assess their effects. A wide range of vari- &bull;
ables, often intangible, are generally involved. For example, performance management,
communications and other factors as well as the plan design will impact on the success
of performance-related pay initiatives. Changes in pay are also typically accompanied
by changes in associated HR processes, with job evaluation exercises, for example, often
accompanied by changes in job content and organization design.
<p>The difficulty of carrying out controlled research studies and comparative experiments &bull;
with different approaches to pay and rewards.
<p>Perceived lack of time and resources to evaluate (even though stronger evidence of &bull;
effectiveness might lead to more resources being allocated to the reward management
function).
<p>A bewildering array of sources is used to generate management advice. Pfeffer and &bull;
Sutton (2006) cite references to Shakespeare, Billy Graham, Jack Welch, Tony Soprano,
fighter pilots, Santa Claus and Attila the Hun.
<p>Lack of training and skills in statistics, finance, quantitative methods, research and &bull;
other relevant disciplines amongst the HR community (although it might be thought
that this would be less true about reward practitioners than other HR professionals
given the requirement for numeracy and, frequently, their finance background).
<p>Sheer laziness, especially when practitioners are not being pushed by others to do it &bull;
(though HR functions are coming under more pressure to justify their existence).
<p>Steven Kerr (1995) commented on this as follows:
<p>One major reason [for failure to evaluate] is that the individuals (in human resources,
or organization development) who would normally be responsible for conducting such </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 443
<p>evaluations are the same ones often charged with introducing the change effort in the
first place. Having convinced top management to spend money, say, on outside consult-
ants, they usually are quite animated afterwards in collecting rigorous vignettes and
anecdotes about how successful the program was. The last thing many desire is a formal,
revealing evaluation. Although members of top management may actually hope for
such systematic evaluation, their reward systems continue to reward ignorance in this
area. And if the HR department abdicates its responsibility, who is to step into the
breach? The consultants themselves? Hardly! They are likely to be too busy collecting
anecdotal &lsquo;evidence&rsquo; of their own, for use on their next client.
<p>What can be done about it?
<p>Interesting suggestions on how to evaluate reward have been made by researchers Corby et al
(2003) Heneman (2002), Kanungo and Mendonca (1988) and Scott, McMullen and Sperling
(2006).
<p>Corby et al (2003) advise that practitioners should have a realistic view of what is achievable,
focus on evaluation in only a few key areas rather than compiling a wish-list, use existing
mechanisms such as employee attitude surveys and human capital reports as far as possible,
and consider perceptions and qualitative criteria, not just &lsquo;hard&rsquo; cost and business figures.
<p>Heneman remarks that the evaluation of the effectiveness of a strategic reward system is often
overlooked among many organizations, but it is an indispensable final step in the process of
implementing a compensation programme. Indeed, assessing the effectiveness of any proce-
dure is just as important, if not more so, as its design and execution. Since it is often compli-
cated to evaluate the effectiveness of a reward programme in terms of financial performance,
so-called &lsquo;soft factors&rsquo; such as employee behavioural reactions to the programme are some-
times an acceptable replacement.
<p>Kanungo and Mendonca (1988) advocate a final review stage in introducing new reward
systems. This consists of reformulating the reward package objectives or redesigning the
reward system or both, based upon the diagnosis of the present reward system. At this stage, a
great deal of learning takes place, as management reflects on the perceptions and expectations
of its employees and their impact on organizational goals. It is also a time for important deci-
sions &ndash; not merely to respond in a reactive mode, but more in a proactive stance that considers
how best the reward system can be creatively employed to cope with the new challenges that
constantly confront a dynamic organization. Therefore, although review is the final step, it is
an ongoing process that enables management to keep on top of the situation at all times.
<p>Research into assessing reward effectiveness conducted by e-reward (2009b) found that
respondents used the following methods to measure the effectiveness of rewards:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>444 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>external market survey: 113 respondents; &bull;
<p>staff attitude survey: 99 respondents; &bull;
<p>benchmarking: 71 respondents; &bull;
<p>internal data analysis: 66 respondents; &bull;
<p>equal pay reviews: 41 respondents. &bull;
<p>As one respondent commented: &lsquo;Do it! Why would anyone spend &pound;xxm pa and not try and
understand each element&rsquo;s effectiveness (and leverage it more)?&rsquo; Another remarked: &lsquo;Build
review and continuous improvement practices into all of your reward programmes, but rec-
ognize that it is not an activity that will happen overnight. It will require a fundamental shift
in your management information and project practices.&rsquo;
<p>Evaluating reward management involves two activities, as described below: 1) conducting
regular reviews to assess the effectiveness of the existing reward system, and 2) establishing the
extent to which the objectives of a reward innovation have been achieved.
<p>Reward effectiveness reviews
<p>As recommended by Armstrong et al (2010) a reward effectiveness review requires the follow-
ing seven steps:
<p>1. Identify reward goals and success criteria.
<p>2. Research and collect both quantitative and qualitative information and evidence on exist-
ing reward policies and practices from inside the organization. This will include conduct-
ing a reward attitude survey (an example is given in Appendix A).
<p>3. Gather information on external reward practices, levels and trends; this can be used to
assess the competitiveness and distinctiveness of rewards in the organization, as well as
drawing out learning from relevant organizations externally, and from external research
on specific reward practices.
<p>4. Use this information to make assessments of the effectiveness of the delivery of reward
goals and of the various pay and reward practices.
<p>5. Determine key reward issues to address.
<p>6. Consider possible options and changes to improve the delivery of the reward goals, and
assess their strengths and weaknesses relative to the current reward practices.
<p>7. Agree the improvements required to increase effectiveness and plan their implementation.
<p>This logical sequence may look like a good structure for a review but the actual process will
depend on the circumstances and needs of the organization. As Mabey et al (1998) point out, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Evaluating Reward Management 445
<p>such approaches provide &lsquo;a model of management which is more rational than is achievable in
practice&rsquo;. Cultural and political factors influence perceptions and judgements, and the extent
to which people behave rationally is limited by their capacity to understand the complexities
of the situation they are in and by their emotional reactions to it &ndash; the concept of bounded
rationality as expressed by Simon (1957).
<p>However, there are three basic requirements that exist in any survey: 1) an understanding of
goals, 2) means of assessing outcomes and impacts related to those goals, and 3) a reasonably
systematic approach to interpreting the results of an assessment and drawing conclusions on
the issues involved and how they should be addressed.
<p>Reward goals
<p>Reward goals can be expressed in guiding principles (see Chapter 4) or the objectives defined
for reward initiatives. Here are some examples:
<p>Aegon UK: Motivate staff sufficiently so that they will ensure the company remains &bull;
successful, thereby allowing for continued competitive levels of reward for superior
performance.
<p>British Airways: Support a performance culture. &bull;
<p>BT: Use the full range of rewards (salary, bonus, benefits and recognition) to recruit &bull;
and retain the best people.
<p>Colt Telecom: Promote a performance culture that underpins the company business &bull;
strategy.
<p>Diageo: Support and enable the talent agenda. &bull;
<p>Financial services company: Reflect the way the organization is changing by encourag- &bull;
ing us to be more responsive to customers.
<p>Friends Provident: Facilitate a real and fundamental top-down change in corporate &bull;
culture.
<p>KPMG: Market-leading rewards for market-leading performance. &bull;
<p>Tesco: Develop a more flexible organization. &bull;
<p>These goals can be classified broadly under the four headings suggested by Corby et al (2003):
<p>Resourcing: recruitment, retention and employee turnover. &bull;
<p>Behaviour: engagement, motivation and commitment. &bull;
<p>Working practices: flexibility. &bull;
<p>Performance: productivity, profitability. &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>446 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>But none of the objectives listed above sets out any specific quantitative targets against which
performance can be measured. The field work carried out by Corby et al (2003) found that
only 2 of the 15 organizations sought to evaluate the impact of their new pay system on per-
formance, and both were in the public sector. They reported that Customs &amp; Excise, when
evaluating its trial of team bonuses, measured financial performance by first establishing a
baseline for the six trial sites and three &lsquo;blind&rsquo; control sites, and then carrying out a further
review after a year. In addition, one of the trial sites carried out a customer satisfaction survey.
Partly because of the limited timescale (one year) and partly because there was &lsquo;a lot of noise
in the system&rsquo;, to quote the HR manager (ie restructuring and new appraisal and promotion
systems), the results were not conclusive. An NHS trust asked staff about the impact of the
new pay system on patient care and a small majority thought that the impact was positive.
<p>There is a reason why people don&rsquo;t set quantitative targets &ndash; it is rarely if ever possible to be
confident about the extent to which reward can impact on performance, and targets therefore
look like hostages to fortune. Post hoc measurements of the impact can also be problematic
because of the amount of work involved and the difficulty of establishing causation. Corby et
al (2003) found that managers were sceptical about the process of pay system evaluation,
holding the view that the link between a pay system and a given outcome &ndash; eg staff attitudes or
service/product delivery &ndash; was well nigh impossible to prove.
<p>Measures
<p>Ideally, the measurement of the impact of reward would compare actuals and trends with
targets, but if it is difficult to set quantified targets this is unlikely to happen. Organizations
that do assess reward practices use a wide variety of measures, as established by the CIPD 2009
reward survey and shown in Table 29.1. Resignation rates, staff surveys and performance man-
agement data are the most popular measures. Profit and productivity measures are used to a
much smaller extent in the private sector.
<p>The possible measures suggested by Armstrong et al (2010) are shown in Table 29.2.</p>

<p>Evaluating Reward Management 449
<p>Evaluating the impact of reward innovations
<p>The objectives of a reward innovation should be expressed from the outset as part of a business
case: &lsquo;This is what we propose to do.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is why we propose to do it.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is how much it
will cost.&rsquo; &lsquo;This is how the organization and its people will benefit.&rsquo; Success criteria should be
defined for each objective. These could be quantitative &ndash; eg a reduction in employee turnover,
an increase in employee engagement or reward opinion survey scores. They might often have
to be qualitative, in effect completing the statement: &lsquo;This innovation will have been successful
when&hellip; happens&rsquo;. Examples of possible objectives and associated success criteria are given in
Table 29.3 and of an engagement survey in Appendix B.
<p>A model of evaluation as a continuous process is illustrated in Figure 29.1. The final step is to
review the whole process by answering the following questions:
<p>How well have the reward changes been implemented, and to what extent are they &bull;
delivering on the reward objectives?
<p>Given what we have learnt, will any changes in design and/or process improve their &bull;
effectiveness?
<p>How are we going to review and assess their effectiveness on an ongoing basis and &bull;
perhaps in some detail after a sufficient time has elapsed to witness the full impact of
the changes?

Responsibility for Reward
<p>Learning outcomes
<p>On completing this chapter you should know about:
<p>The role of the reward professional &bull;
<p>The reward role of line managers &bull;
<p>How to use reward consultants &bull;
<p>Introduction
<p>Reward strategy is formulated and actioned by people. Top management is in charge but HR
professionals, especially reward specialists, are actively involved. Increasingly, however, it is
line managers who have the responsibility for implementing reward policies and practices.
This chapter deals with the roles of the reward professional and line managers. The chapter
concludes with a brief note on the use of management consultants.
<p>The role of the reward professional
<p>HR and reward specialists develop and implement reward strategies, policies and processes,
administer and audit existing systems, and provide advice and guidance to line managers.
They deal with employee relations issues such as involvement, communications, negotiations,
appeals and grievances.
<p>The key roles for &lsquo;high value-adding&rsquo; reward professionals as described by Brown and Christie
(2005) are:
<p>452 </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 453
<p>keeping up with leading-edge thinking and approaches and staying ahead of the game &bull;
on environmental trends;
<p>tailoring approaches and arrangements to suit the unique goals, character and culture &bull;
of the organization, and measuring and demonstrating the value added by them, always
in the context of business and organizational knowledge and understanding;
<p>developing and applying administrative expertise to deliver highly efficient and well- &bull;
serviced reward processes;
<p>assessing and influencing the culture of the organization, with responsibility for reward &bull;
communications;
<p>operating as an integral part of the HR and business team and providing a reward strat- &bull;
egy framework that coordinates all the policies and practices designed to engage and
motivate staff to deliver the organization&rsquo;s strategy.
<p>Perhaps the most valuable contribution reward professionals make is to develop reward
arrangements that support the business strategy, working with line managers as consultants to
assist in this &ndash; as one head of reward put it to Brown and Christie: &lsquo;Shifting our culture to a
more performance-oriented business and aligning reward policies accordingly&rsquo;. Yet research
conducted by the CIPD in 2005 found that significant portions of the function&rsquo;s time are still
being absorbed in routine administrative activities and responding to immediate queries and
crises.
<p>At Citigroup the role of reward specialists is to bring parties together to facilitate and make
sustainable and effective decisions, share experiences, transfer successes and encourage a focus
on long-term sustainability and future development.
<p>The role of reward in Diageo comprises five key elements:
<p>align the reward approach with the business strategy; &bull;
<p>support and enable the talent agenda; &bull;
<p>provide clear principles to enable decision making in the business; &bull;
<p>enable every employee to understand why they get paid what they get paid; &bull;
<p>have a customer service ethic that results in great execution. &bull;
<p>Qualities required
<p>Reward specialists need the skills and expertise to design and manage complex systems that
meet the needs of users. Strategic thinking is necessary but this is not enough; service delivery
is equally important. Reward innovations can affect people deeply and they will resist or at
least resent changes that they perceive to be detrimental. It is therefore essential for reward
specialists to have change management skills.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>454 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>The 150 respondents to the 2007 e-reward census of reward professionals stated that the top
four qualities required were: 1) business awareness, 2) numeracy and analytical ability, 3)
technical reward skills and 4) influencing skills.
<p>The CIPD performance and reward profession map highlights the following competencies
required by senior reward professionals:
<p>understand the organization&rsquo;s strategy, performance goals and drivers; &bull;
<p>speak the language of the business and understand how reward can drive performance; &bull;
<p>know how to translate organization strategy into performance and reward strategies &bull;
and operating plans;
<p>consider constituent parts of the reward and recognition package for the organization, &bull;
ensuring that there is coherence in the overall offer and that it is aligned with and will
drive the organization&rsquo;s strategy and plans;
<p>manage the delivery of planned reward programmes; &bull;
<p>challenge executive leadership to adopt a performance-driven culture underpinned by &bull;
a strong performance management capability.
<p>Organization of the reward function
<p>The e-reward 2007 census found that 78 per cent of the respondents&rsquo; organizations had a
reward centre of expertise and 40 per cent had a shared service centre.
<p>The role of a reward centre of expertise is to develop and contribute to the implementation of
reward strategy, formulate reward policies, provide professional support to business policy for
corporate HR, and deal with complex issues raised by the shared service centre if one exists. Its
members act as consultants in assessing and designing reward solutions.
<p>The role of a reward shared service centre is to handle some or all day-to-day administrative
(transactional) processes. Its activities are centralized into one common unit, often using call
centre technology and/or intranet systems for online self-service.
<p>The following are three examples drawn from e-reward 2008 case studies of organizations
with centres of expertise and shared service centres:
<p>Lloyds TSB has two centres of expertise, a service delivery function and four dedicated &bull;
HR sections The head of pay policy and employee benefits is responsible for external
benchmarking, flexible benefits, pay reviews, pay reporting, total reward statements,
bonus schemes and reward communications. In addition, there are four reward busi-
ness partners for each of the main divisions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 455
<p>National Australia Bank Group adopts the Ulrich &lsquo;three-legged stool&rsquo; model with a &bull;
reward centre of expertise and &ndash; dealing with all HR matters, including reward &ndash; a
shared services centre and seven business partners.
<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers operates a centralized human capital shared services centre &bull;
alongside a number of centres of expertise, including one dedicated to reward. The role
of the three senior managers in the centre is to act as business partners and provide
advisory and consultancy services.
<p>Role of line managers
<p>The trend is to devolve more authority to line managers for decisions on pay increases awarded
in periodical individual pay reviews and, less commonly, fixing rates of pay on appointment
or promotion. This process reflects the general tendency to devolve more decision-making
authority to line managers on the grounds that, if managers are to be held accountable for the
management of their resources and the performance of their teams, they ought to be given
scope within guidelines to determine how their team members should be rewarded. It is also
argued that line managers are close to individual employees and are in the best position to
know how they should be valued.
<p>The arguments for devolving more authority to line managers for pay decisions are powerful
but it is still necessary to ensure that reward policies are followed, pay decisions are consistent
and fair, and pay costs are controlled. Policy guidelines as described in Chapter 28 are required
to spell out the basis upon which rates of pay are fixed and reviewed. Managers should be
expected to keep within their pay budgets.
<p>There is also the issue of the capacity of line managers to carry out their devolved role effec-
tively. As Brown and Purcell (2007) commented: &lsquo;How can your reward arrangements ever be
effective if your managers can&rsquo;t manage and communicate them?&rsquo; They described a vicious
circle of:
<p>line managers being given increasing responsibility to manage ever-more complex pay &bull;
processes, with reduced levels of HR function support;
<p>managers lacking the skills to cope with these increased demands; &bull;
<p>HR therefore not trusting line managers and restricting their discretion in these proc- &bull;
esses, which leads to managers feeling disempowered and employees not understand-
ing and trusting them either.
<p>Line managers should not be expected to make crucial pay decisions without training in the
processes involved and briefing on the policy guidelines. Reward or HR specialists have a
crucial role not only in monitoring the implementation of pay policies but also in providing </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>456 The Practice of Reward Management
<p>advice and guidance, always with the aim of developing the skills and confidence of the line
managers with whom they are involved.
<p>The major difficulties presented by devolving more responsibility to line managers are that:
<p>They may not have the knowledge or skills to carry out their responsibilities. &bull;
<p>They may be unenthusiastic about this aspect of their role, which they would see as a &bull;
diversion from their real job &ndash; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the HR department there for?&rsquo; they might say.
<p>It might be difficult to achieve acceptable standards of fairness, equity and consistency &bull;
without policing managers so closely that devolution becomes a farce.
<p>The answers to these problems are to develop clear guidelines for managers on the factors they
should take into account in making pay decisions, brief and train managers on how to inter-
pret and apply the guidelines, provide continuing but not oppressive support from HR when
required and monitor pay decisions to ensure that guidelines are being followed but, again,
not oppressively.
<p>Respondents to the 2007 e-reward survey made the following comments on the line manager&rsquo;s
role in managing contingent pay schemes:
<p>ensure managers have bought-in to the scheme and are trained and fully understand its &bull;
operation;
<p>make sure managers are willing and able to differentiate high performers from the &bull;
rest;
<p>ensure managers can also manage poor performance; &bull;
<p>make certain the messages coming from management and more senior levels are the &bull;
same and that, overall, decisions made are consistent.
<p>Using reward consultants
<p>Reward consultants are frequently engaged to help with major development projects by pro-
viding expertise and additional resources (an extra pair of hands). They can conduct diagnos-
tic reviews and employee attitude surveys, and provide disinterested advice. Effective
consultants add credibility and value because they have the knowledge of good practice and
project management that may not be available in the organization. The e-reward 2007 survey
found that 72 per cent of the respondents had employed them.
<p>To make good use of consultants it is necessary to:
<p>spell out terms of reference, deliverables and the timetable; &bull;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Responsibility for Reward 457
<p>take great care when selecting them, to ensure that they have the expertise and experi- &bull;
ence required and will &lsquo;fit&rsquo; into the organization, and that they produce realistic and
acceptable indications of the cost of their fees and expenses;
<p>meet and vet the consultant who is going to carry out the work, not just the senior con- &bull;
sultant who presents the proposal;
<p>agree up front how they will work alongside line management, HR and trade unions, &bull;
and the basis upon which the project will be monitored and controlled;
<p>ask for regular reports and hold &lsquo;milestone&rsquo; meetings in order to review progress and &bull;
costs.
<p>It seems that reward specialists are good at applying these precepts &ndash; 97 per cent of the respond-
ents to the e-reward 2007 survey who had used consultants were satisfied with them.
<p>Line managers&rsquo; responsibility for reward: six tips
Devolve as much responsibility for reward decisions to line managers as &bull;
possible consistent with the need to ensure that reward policy guidelines are
followed and reward decisions are fair and reasonably consistent.
<p>Ensure that reward policies and guidelines are clear and unequivocal. &bull;
<p>Brief managers thoroughly on the policies and guidelines. &bull;
<p>Train newly appointed managers (and retrain existing managers as necessary) &bull;
in their reward management responsibilities.
<p>Provide guidance and help from HR or reward specialists whenever it is needed. &bull;
<p>Monitor reward decisions and advise line managers on alternative approaches &bull;
as necessary.
