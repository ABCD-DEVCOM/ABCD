<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 403
<p>Are the products made by us needed or used by anyone? If yes then who are they, when and how
do they buy and what are they willing to pay for it? An advertising agency needs to understand ans-
wers to these questions with a great degree of accuracy.
<p>Successful campaigns are the result of this knowledge and how the agency uses it to a large degree.
Besides they should know the market changes occurring on a continuous basis and be good at com-
municating. An excellent copywriter using good, correct language may not be able to cause even a
ripple if the copy goes above the intelligence level of the target market. The mindsets of the people,
the slang they use and the imagery acceptable or valued by them will create the right impact. What
matters most to the copywriter about a product may have little interest to his audience. The lifestyle
of people in advertising, who enjoy good salaries, may be totally at variance with the customer group.
As fi lm actors sometimes live in the slum areas to get a feel of the place and the mindset of the slum
dwellers, it will be a good idea for the agency people to at least investigate the members of the target
market segments in depth with an open mind.
<p>The making of an advertising campaign is a team task and that is where the team members who
may be experts in their own fi eld of activity teach one person the psychological angle of the target mar-
ket as it is the focal point of any campaign. This team building process is used in most agencies where
the senior members use campaigns for developing the junior members of the team. Even the most
well-formulated campaign can go haywire due to reasons other than the campaign itself. It could be
that the timing of the campaign or even the endorser or the model used may not have the right kind
of appeal.
<p>Therefore, advertising agencies are advised to use all caution in spite of the time constraints and
the dreaded deadlines. A bad campaign can do a lot of damage and a good one can bring in additional
revenues to offset any loss due to delay in the launch of the campaign. One only wishes that the
clients would understand this fundamental part of advertising!
<p>The dilemma faced by the people in advertising, both the client&rsquo;s people and those from the agency,
is that when there are a number of controllable and non-controllable variables in the marketing mix,
it is the advertisement which gets the axe for non-achievement of marketing targets. Figure 15.19
shows this clearly.
<p>Were the increased sales due to advertising or due to better discounts to the dealers, Maruti may
be guessing! Was the celebrity endorsement responsible or was it personal sales efforts by the sales
team manufacturers of air conditioners might have to worry about. Similarly in each situation where
the sales targets have been exceeded or sales have fallen short of the targets, the dilemma will always
be there.

<p>The customer mindset and the socioeconomic factors are non-discernible like a black box and
what comes out of it is the only indicator available. The effi cacy of advertising can at best be seen
in its absence. Just try to imagine a week with no advertisement on any media of Coke. It will have
disastrous effect on its sales. In the fi rst few days the hard-core Coke drinkers will not have any drink.
Later on they may start drinking any other drink.
<p>There are three types of customers:
<p>1. Hard-core addicts who will not have any other drink for at least a month.
2. Those moderately addicted to Coke who will change to another drink in a week&rsquo;s time.
3. Those in no way addicted to Coke who will change over to another drink on the fi rst day itself.
<p>It is therefore impossible for any of the colas to even think of reducing their advertising leave
alone closing it completely. If you ask Coke why they advertise so heavily, their answer would be as
follows: They know that their customers like the product. The advertisements are to keep pressing the
point. For non-customers, they would want them to try out the product and then get in to the habit
of drinking it. They encourage that their customers serve Coke to their guests as well.
<p>Advertisers of other not so well-known products advertise to improve their brand image or brand
equity. Advertising helps in changing the perception of the customer, who uses a competitive product,
in their favour.
<p>Advertising is used for among other things to introduce new features and benefi ts of the product.
Advertising works on many levels:
<p>1. On eyes and ears for receiving the message.
2. On the mindset for understanding the message.
3. On the heart where feelings create goodwill and proper response.
<p>Therefore, while testing an advertisement, the following questions need to be answered:
<p>FOR THE EYES AND EARS
<p> Did the advertisement reach the customer?
Did it catch the customer&rsquo;s attention?
Did it bring in the top of the mind recall?
Was it seen or heard or both?
<p>FOR THE MINDSET
<p> Was the advertisement understood in the way it was meant to be understood?
<p>Figure 15.19 Channels for Achieving Marketing Goals</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 405
<p> Did the customer get the message?
Were the message and brand read together?
Was the message not clear?
<p>FOR THE HEART
<p> Was the product accepted by the customer?
Did it change the customer&rsquo;s attitude about the brand in its favour?
Did the feelings change after seeing the advertisement?
Did the brand perception change?
Did it change the perception of competing brands against them?
Did the purchase action take place?
<p>At this point the customers can be asked about the difference the advertisement made&mdash;was it
the music, a phrase or the slogan or the design, the artwork&mdash;and it will give you an insight about the
success or non-success of the advertisement.
<p>Advertisers and the agency both keenly await the result of such a response. It is not worthwhile to
stand on ego and keep imagining that I am the best creative person and can do no wrong. Remember
that a lot of money is involved in the game of advertising and it may have little effect on you as the
agency man but it could make or break a product and with it its fi rm.
<p>Some reactions about the advertisements could read as follows:
<p>1. A loser in the elections: &lsquo;if only my image was properly advertised&rsquo;.
2. An advertising agency after the successful launch of a product: &lsquo;the sales graph is ample proof
<p>that our campaign was a big success&rsquo;.
3. A retailer may lament after spending money on advertising without any increase in business:
<p>&lsquo;it does not work for us, period&rsquo;.
4. An industrial marketing manager may be sure of his team but still want advertising to get a
<p>foot in the door for his salespersons.
<p>ADVERTISING&mdash;FOCUS ON CONTROVERSIAL MATTERS
<p>The clothing fi rm Raymond advertises its suiting as suiting for the &rsquo;complete man&rsquo;; it looks at the
market segment of the rich and elite. Even companies like Manikchand Gutka claim that it is aimed
at the elite only. Lots of advertising can be seen in the media everyday for the high bracket seg-
ment. First of all do the products deliver? Can they really match up with the expectations of that
customer group?
<p>Creative art focuses on the mindsets of the people. It is believed that everyone tries to mould or
get moulded as per his or her environment and other fellow beings. Thus people develop symmetry
in their behaviour pattern. If there is no precedence of behaviour, people develop one.
<p>Advertising is fl uid, dynamic and it lacks a permanent structure. It also means that advertising
creativity comes more from the creative person rather than from the customers. That is why in many
cases, an advertisement liked by the agency is severely criticised by the viewers. Everyone sees what
he wants to see, only a view of one of the sides or parameters of advertising.</p>

<p>The blind men&rsquo;s bluff is an appropriate example for the case. Six blind men feel an elephant&rsquo;s body
and express their reactions as follows:
<p>The fi rst touches the elephant&rsquo;s side and says it is a wall.
The second touches the elephant&rsquo;s feet and says it is a tree.
The third touches the elephant&rsquo;s tusk and calls it a spear.
The fourth feels the elephant&rsquo;s trunk and says it is a snake.
The fi fth touches the elephant&rsquo;s ear and calls it a fan.
Finally, the sixth touches the elephant&rsquo;s tail and calls it a rope.
<p>If we were to ask people if an advertisement was interesting, the answers would be:
<p>1. Industrial product advertisement&mdash;not at all
2. Radio jingle&mdash;sure
3. Classifi ed&mdash;hardly
4. TV commercial&mdash;of course yes
5. Direct mail&mdash;sometimes
<p>Advertising is, therefore, a part of the entire socio-cultural system (see Figure 15.20).
<p>Figure 15.20 Advertising and Socio-cultural and Economic Relationships
<p>Basically people are highly self-centred. They like to take care of their own interests. People are
usually apathetic towards their surroundings unless they start interfering with their self-interest.
Therefore, as a corollary, to make them interested talk of things of their interest.
<p>The free market is supposed to be product of the US. In free markets the individual buyers de-
cide what to buy and what not to buy. The manufacturers and sellers have to manufacture the same
products. The process is the reverse of the movement in the order of raw materials, production and
marketing (see Figure 15.21).
<p>Figure 15.21 Retailers to Manufacturers and Raw Materials</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 407
<p>The free market encourages competition, which is to the benefi t of the consumer. Competition among
the sellers and suppliers forces the manufacturers to keep on innovating and differentiating their
products. Prices, on the other hand, depend on competition and the demand&ndash;supply equation.
<p>Selling Price = a f (competition + supply demand gap)
Where a is the cost of manufacture and f is the function.
<p>To make matters more complex, we have GNP, salaries, wages, rents, interest rates and dividends
which all defi ne the market. The free market believes that the customers are wise, sane people who
decide on only the merits of products. Yet, there are sceptics who believe that the contrary is true and
that the customers need to be nurtured and educated. The government of the land comes to the rescue
by formulating laws for the protection of customers.
<p>Free thinkers want the following to be happening in the market place:
<p>1. Buyers and sellers should be free to ply their trade as they deem fi t within the law of the
land.
<p>2. Customers should be accepted as people with intelligence, who can make the right decisions.
3. Competition provides the required checks and balances in the market place, which is benefi cial
<p>to the entire community.
<p>The free market, including advertising, is on the fi ring line for the following reasons:
<p>1. Suppliers can force buyers into buying their products through alluring advertisements that
may not always be justifi ed.
<p>2. Buyers may be given a lopsided view if they are told about only the favourable things about
the product.
<p>3. Multinational corporations and large businesses dominate the market and can squeeze out
small players, who may be offering a good product, through sheer money power.
<p>Business guru R. Nadar has the following remedies for the ills of the free market:
<p>1. Firms should remain honest in their dealings.
2. They should stop corrupting the politicians with underhand election funds.
3. Be good to workers by providing them a healthy work environment.
4. Stop polluting the planet by disposing solid, liquid and gaseous effl uents onto the earth&rsquo;s surface.
5. Start long-range planning for the benefi t of their stakeholders.
<p>Let us see how advertising can be dangerous to society:
<p>1. In the West, the use of alcohol among teenagers has increased in an alarming manner. Sports
events show healthy sportspersons enjoying drinks in the name of team spirit.
<p>2. Billions of dollars are spent in advertising cigarettes&mdash;the main cause of a lot of terminal
diseases.
<p>3. Advertisements for contraceptives are almost pornographic and the entire family sees these
together.
<p>4. Freedom to buy could lead to unnecessary purchases. People are supposed to become wiser
after making a few mistakes. Could the mistakes prove too costly?</p>

<p>5. Appeals to children who have no fi nancial knowledge can become a big embarrassment, if
nothing else, to parents.
<p>6. Children and women are fully exploited and at times for the sake of a few rupees they let
themselves be exploited to the detriment of society.
<p>7. At times, truth becomes a victim as it is twisted out of shape to give it the right colours that are
accepted and appreciated by the customers.
<p>As a fi rst step towards rationalisation, a code of self-regulation has come into place in many coun-
tries. Advertising agency associations monitor advertisements and play the role of an internal censor
for offensive advertisements.
<p>James Roman has commented on advertisements featuring children. In his opinion, advertising
has reached its nadir in allowing children to be manipulated and programmed to act as advertising
surrogates promoting the latest industry virtues.
<p>Others have proposed a ban on advertisements directed towards children who are too young to
understand the purpose of advertisements, mainly children below the age of eight years. They have
suggested a ban on advertisements for candies, which are harmful for the teeth, especially for children
of the age group of 8&ndash;11 years. Advertisements for candies for older children should have reference to
the health problems that eating candies could entail. It has been said that there is no harmful effect on
children because of these advertisements except that at the grocers shop children pester their parents
into buying the advertised products.
<p>Finally, it has to be seen how truthful advertisements are. Is puffery the main theme or has it been
totally avoided. See the following copy:
<p>1. The toothpaste gives round the clock protection against harmful germs (are germs of some
other kinds too?).
<p>2. Use the masala and forget mother&rsquo;s cooking (how can a masala cook the food?).
3. Use the talcum powder and feel cool (is it a powder or an air conditioner?).
4. Use the soap and become a beauty in 10 days (is the soap also a cosmetologist?).
<p>In your daily life you will fi nd so many of these types of advertisements. Is it not possible to fi nd
out the real advantages and benefi ts of a product and highlight them?
<p>Information, which the customers are looking for, is given next. Some of these are mandatory as
per the rule laid down by the government:
<p>1. On the package the weight, size, volume, quantity, date of manufacture and date of expiry must
be given.
<p>2. Possible harmful effects of the products must be listed.
3. Price should be inclusive of all taxes.
4. Country of manufacture should be listed.
<p>Information beyond the advertisement comes from topical articles by experts like Murad Ali Beg
writing about cars or Tarla Dalal writing about food. Such articles, when they appear in consumer
magazines do a lot of good to both the buyers and the sellers.
<p>The plus and minus points of advertising are shown in Table 15.8.
Checking the balance sheet of advertising we can safely say that it is a valuable communication
<p>vehicle which provides the customers with variety and choices for their purchase action. Firms take
advantage of one brand doing well to group it with other products to make them equally popular. </p>
<br>

<p>In highly competitive areas, bunching of products to sell more is a known practice, especially in the
IT and computer industry.
<p>ADVERTISING&mdash;A MASS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
Advertising implies mass communication as the advertiser is communicating with a large number
of people who he is unlikely to meet or know. The advertiser does not know the circumstances
when the message given by him is seen or heard by the people. The advertiser also does not get any
feedback about the immediate response of the viewers after seeing the advertisement.
<p>On the other side of the coin, the advertiser can reach a large number of people at a cost, which is
low when compared to the money and time he will spend if he has to meet all of them personally. And
this is not even possible as by the time he has fi nished meeting all potential customers, the product
about which the meeting is taking place may even become obsolete. In order to make the most of
advertising efforts, advertisers have to make the advertisement interesting, attractive and eye-catching.
With TV as a media and the availability of computer graphics, the possibilities are immense.
<p>It is an accepted fact that no two persons are alike. Brain chemistry differs between people, which
ensures that every individual will behave differently given the same stimulus. Even the same person
behaves in a different manner with the same stimulus, depending on his mood, surroundings and
state of health.
<p>Behaviour depends on psychological factors and environmental factors. Figure 15.22 shows the
advertising process.

<p>Creativity comes from generating several ideas and then through the screening process, the
right idea is arrived at. Some years back, Coke was declared the offi cial drink for the 2007 Cricket
World Cup. Naturally, the main competitors, Pepsi faced rough weather till they got it right. When
somebody said, after all what is so offi cial about cold drink, the Pepsi slogan came as a breath of fresh
air. It said: &lsquo;there is nothing offi cial about it. Drink Pepsi!&rsquo;
<p>While making an advertisement, care has to be taken to differentiate between providing awareness
and creating emotional bonding with the product. For this purpose the following can be used:
<p>1. Product benefi t ranking.
2. Adjectives to be used.
3. Metaphors to be used.
4. Success stories to be told.
5. Endorsers to be selected.
<p>For commercials, activities around the fi lming have to be activated. The use of the product&rsquo;s unique
selling proposition (USP) or several USPs depending on the plan of advertisement, and the media is
a big help in creating an eye-catching advertisement:
<p>1. Advertisements must specify the benefi ts buyers will get from the use of the product (if possible,
depending on the product and more especially for industrial products, the benefi t if translated
into rupees per unit of time will have great pulling power).
<p>2. The benefi ts should be different from what the competition is offering.
3. The benefi t must be strong enough to become a driving force for the millions of viewers.
<p>For understanding how agencies try to see that the customers buy the products advertised by them
and how they persuade them, the following points need to be considered:
<p>1. Creativity of the advertisement.
2. Eye-catching presentation.
3. Matter that is easy to understand.
4. Acceptance of the proposal given in the advertisement.
<p>Who says so is important in advertisements. The endorsers should have credibility with the cus-
tomers. A professor of law or a leading lawyer would be the best choice for endorsing a book on law.
However, if the lawyer is taken for a model who says good things about the book because of the
money he is getting for the advertisement, the credibility goes down.
<p>A pretty girl advertising a lipstick will be accepted as she would be considered an expert. The
same model may not be the best choice for advertising detergents as customers may not believe
that she has ever washed her clothes herself. Once the viewers accept the source, they tend to put
the advertisement in their memory and recall it at the time of purchase even though they may have
forgotten the endorser.
<p>The advertisement becomes eye-catching if the fi rm has good brand equity. Similarly, if the endorser
is well respected, then the advertisement gains attractiveness.
<p>For creating a positive attitude among the customers, the following methods are used:
<p>1. Expressing views in a way which is of interest to the viewers.
2. Enhancing the customer&rsquo;s ego by praising him for taking the right decision.
3. Making statements, which can be verifi ed by the viewers, through logical reasoning.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 411
<p>4. Giving the benefi ts the customers will derive from the products. At times, letting viewers draw
their own conclusions arouses their curiosity. The cream makes skin smooth and glowing, have
you tried it?
<p>5. Giving consumers the benefi ts provided by the competition and at the same time stressing on
the positive side of your product and the not so positive side of the competitors. The compari-
son highlights the product as the right choice. These days competitive advertisements have
become the vogue. Care must be taken to give the right picture, the truth and nothing but the
truth, because otherwise you may be dragged to court by the competitors.
<p>6. Emotions play a vital role in purchases made by people, although most will not agree to this
statement. Some examples are: (i) For a prettier you! Get the man of your choice by using XYZ
cosmetic; (ii) Do you know what will happen when you are no more? Save for your loved ones,
Insure with us&mdash;LIC; (iii) What kind of life do you want for your grandchildren? Vote for a
pollution-free world&mdash;grow more trees; (iv) Today your friendly neighbour may kill you (an
advertisement against drunken driving).
<p>Now that you have got your customers to buy your products how are you going to retain them?
The onslaught of competitive forces is never ending. Raising your brand equity is one way of doing it.
Next, the risk associated with the change need to be stressed, &lsquo;change your cars engine oil and lower
the time of overhaul&rsquo;, &lsquo;The substitute toothpastes cause tooth decay, are you willing to risk it?&rsquo; or &lsquo;you
did try to change once and it lead to disaster. Please make sane decisions now&rsquo;.
<p>Continuous sales promotional plans are other methods albeit they can be copied sooner rather
than later. The customers can be immunised against the virus of the competitive product by putting
your own product on its rightful pedestal. Another method is to keep stating what the competition
is saying and then, one by one, refuting all their claims logically. For instance, suppose you sell pure
fruit juices. The competition claims that no fruit juice can have a shelf life long enough to be able to
sell in the entire country. Talk about it and then give proof of your several fi lling and juice extracting
facilities around the country. Suppose you have to sell metro rail to the local public. So far, personal
transport has been in use, as other public transport like buses are overcrowded and the public does
not want to go near it. Talk about the cost that can be saved, rising petrol costs reduction in pollution
levels and the fact that decrease in road traffi c will make roads safe for children.
<p>In most advertisements there are four factors that need to be considered together (see
Figure 15.23).
<p>Figure 15.23 Market Life Cycle
<p>A person belonging to a group with similar attitudes should make endorsements. Furthermore
he should be able to withstand the customer&rsquo;s scrutiny test. He should be imaging the self-testing
of the customer. He or she should be likeable and attractive. If the product qualities are nebulous in
nature and cannot be verifi ed easily then endorsements will be more useful. The customers should
know endorsers as worthy of their acceptance. The endorser should take care to project his image </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management412
<p>as that of an outsider! He should talk like an expert, endorse the fi rm&rsquo;s product only, and not those
of the competitors and should have a long-term endorsement agreement.
<p>The messages should give information most sought out by the customers. The message should
appear to the customer as unambiguous, acceptable and convincing. The concept of product benefi ts
should match with what the customer is looking for.
<p>One way is to point out what is missing in the customer&rsquo;s life and then propose the product as a
fulfi lment of what is missing. An advertisement for an air conditioner could run along the following
lines: &lsquo; having lived all my life in the terrible heat of Delhi, I have no where to go&rsquo;. &lsquo;Why, this summer
go to Switzerland, at least for the climate, buy our silent air conditioners that make you feel like you
are in Switzerland&rsquo;.
<p>Figure 15.24 Advertising to Purchase Action
<p>People start with negative thinking: no, it is just not possible (see Figure 15.24). This defi nes their
problem and then they plan to solve the problem. At this point advertisement comes in handy to
suggest a solution and change the perspective of the customer from a negative one to a positive one.
With your brand implanted in the buyer&rsquo;s mind, it becomes easy to have your products embedded
in the memory bank of the customer for future use and for purchase action.

<p>Market Life Cycle
<p>The market or a product goes through a life cycle. The market is created then it grows, reaches maturity
and then it declines, as can be seen from Figure 15.25.
<p>Figure 15.25 Market Life Stages
<p>The main characteristics of the creation or introduction stage are:
<p>1. Market grows quickly but in a small area.
2. Product may still be in the trial-run stage, the process may not be fully adapted.
3. Prices are high but fl exible.
4. Main customers are innovative buyers.
5. Time to build brand image.
6. Limited or no competition.
7. Product launches need high capital.
8. Distributors who know the customers better have the upper hand over the manufacturer.
9. Limited or negative cash fl ow.
<p>The characteristics of the growth stage are:
<p>1. High market growth.
2. Design of product fi nal, plans on for different models.
3. Production process standardisation is complete.
4. Competition starts to enter the market, prices fall.
5. Building brand image is on the top of the agenda for the fi rm.
6. Funds are needed for increase in market demand, for advertising and other marketing activities,
<p>like promotion, training.
7. Profi ts come but may yet be only marginal.
<p>The characteristics of the maturity stage are:
<p>1. Low growth of the market.
2. Low level of innovations.
3. Emphasis on effectiveness and effi ciency in operations.
4. Price reductions due to increase in competition.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management414
<p>5. Firms try different market segments.
6. Heavy advertising and promotion for maintaining market share.
7. Profi ts decline.
<p>The characteristics of the decline stage are:
<p>1. Market decreases.
2. Product remains unchanged.
3. Prices are stable.
4. Market runs on its inertia.
5. Many players close shop and fi rms could take their share at least till it exists.
6. Profi ts are low.
<p>INTRODUCTORY OR CREATION STAGE
<p>Firms may enter the market at any stage of the market life cycle, but the entrants in the introduction
stage get the benefi t of being the fi rst and gain advantage over competition which comes afterwards.
They can have the largest share of the market. Maruti 800 came in the market as a pioneer small car
and it has stayed on top in its category. With early establishment of the brand, the fi rst comers&rsquo; gains
competitive advantage. They can lead in advertising campaigns, distribution networks (by cornering
the best members of the channel). However, if the fi rst comers are not vigilant enough, the followers
can improve on their product, price, placements and promotion to outperform the fi rst comers.
<p>GROWTH STAGE
<p>In this stage, the focus is on increase in production to catch up with the growing demand. The new
product and its technology get translated into high volumes, resulting in profi ts and increased
sales. However, at this stage, competition also opens up with its own brands (brand loyalties are yet
to be established) channel members keep having the upper hand with their affi nity to the customers.
Substitute products, which have been in the market, increase their pressure on the customers with
bigger promotional plans. Firms keeping skimming (high) price and invite competition. Copies of the
product, which might be better in aesthetics, appear in the market at relatively lower prices (as they
do not have to spend much on technology development).
<p>MATURITY STAGE
<p>In this stage, the competition reaches its peak, there is no continued growth, which precludes several
fi rms from occupying their positions and many quit the market. Technological advantage disappears
aiding competition; cost reduction has peaked for all the competitors, with no extra advantage to any.
Competition boils down to price as the product differentiation has been nullifi ed by competition.
Brand image, low price, strength of the channel members and strong sales force are required to stay
afl oat in this stage. Price reduction can, however, be a double-edged weapon, as price is often equated
to quality by the customers and any reduction can be seen as the fi rm&rsquo;s acknowledgement that its </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 415
<p>product is inferior to that of the competition&rsquo;s. Reduced prices have a tendency of sticking on to the
product; therefore fi rms prefer to have other types of sales promotions (like buy two and get one free),
where the stipulation invariably is: &lsquo;till stocks last&rsquo; and the promotion can be withdrawn when the fi rm
believes it has achieved its objective. Firms need to be sure of the stage of the market life cycle they
are competing in. Selecting a niche market segment where the fi rm enjoys a good share of the market
is one possible answer. While there is no point in spending on increasing market share, relationship
marketing can bring in the custom and the desired revenues to the fi rm.
<p>DECLINE STAGE
<p>In this stage, markets get new substitute products, newer technology and the product demands go
down in this stage. Video cassette recorders (VCRs) were the rage in the market in the 1980s. With the
advent of satellite channels and cable TV networks, VCRs have virtually no market demand. In such
times, fi rms, who have enjoyed a reasonably good market share, can get into niche markets; VCRs are
still needed by some teaching institutes. The fi rms can plan one of the following strategies in the
decline stage of the market life cycle:
<p>1. Divestment
2. Harvest
3. Enter a niche market
4. Leadership
5. Turnaround
<p>The divestment strategy enables the fi rm to sell of its production unit and then the fi rm can use the
money for other markets and products. Selling in a declining market is never easy unless the plant
can make other products or is exported out of the country.
<p>The harvest strategy only postpones the divestment decision to take advantage of some competi-
tion divesting from the market to cash in on the remaining market. Niche market strategy involves
getting into a market segment, which still exists and favours the fi rm&rsquo;s product.
<p>The fi rm can assume a leadership role if most major players have exited from the market and the
fi rm can get the entire market to itself. If required the fi rm can help its competitors in divestment, by
taking over their manufacturing facilities, if they are having diffi culties in making an exit. The fi rm
could also temporarily use penetrating pricing to scare competition away from the market. However,
whatever be the intermediate strategy, the fi rm should not forget that the market is declining and be
ready to divest at the appropriate time or go for a turnaround strategy.
<p>In a turnaround strategy, the fi rm needs a complete overhaul of the fi rm to make it leaner, its product
more acceptable and may be redefi ned to take the introduction stage again. Firms in India have been
downsizing or as it is being called euphemistically, right sizing, in order to remain competitive in the
market. The classic case of a fi rm adopting a turnaround strategy is that of Chrysler (given in the case
studies part of this book), which the students should fi nd both interesting and educative.
<p>Basically, in a turnaround strategy, the fi rm needs to follow the guidelines discussed next:
<p>1. The fi rm must defi ne its objectives for the turnaround strategy, like reduction in costs, working
capital requirements, etc.
<p>2. It must evaluate its strengths and weaknesses, list the superfl uous men and superfl uous
activities.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management416
<p>3. It must scan the personnel at each level of operation and reduce the number across the board
without any discrimination. (In the process it may be wise to take the deadwood, the ineffi cient
and slow movers out.)
<p>4. Look at all the activities and processes to locate the one&rsquo;s not contributing to customer&rsquo;s
benefi t.
<p>5. If any activity or process cannot be dropped then see if these can be subcontracted, that is,
farmed out.
<p>6. It must consolidate its position. After the reduction phase, the fi rm must take stock again; give
better jobs and remunerations to the remaining personnel to ensure that they do not fall into
the fear of losing their jobs.
<p>7. Finally, the fi rm must reassess its new strengths and weaknesses and compare results from the
initial objectives of the turnaround strategy.

This chapter&rsquo;s focus is on defi ning international public relations (PR), the common objectives of PR,
the PR process, the target public for PR and the PR message. Public relations can be and usually
is an effective form of creating a positive marketing climate for the fi rm and thus becomes part of
marketing communication methods.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>What we see on TV as advertisements for eggs, milk and diamonds is not direct marketing/
advertising as you hardly fi nd any sponsor. Drink more milk, eat eggs everyday are meant
to create awareness among the public and hence can be called PR campaigns. Unfortunately,
<p>the task of PR is not appreciated by most people and it tends to become a thankless one. During elec-
tion campaigns, after the candidate has fi nished his speech and gone, it is his secretary who remains
behind to answer the questions regarding how the speech should be interpreted for improving the
candidate&rsquo;s image. After the corporate chairman has given an expos&eacute; of the fi rm&rsquo;s plans, its elabora-
tion and explanation is done by the PR persons. Press releases are part of the PR job. In case of any
catastrophe, the PR has to explain how the fi rm is coping with it and the damage control measures it is
going to take. The Exxon oil spill in the Atlantic ocean had the oil company&rsquo;s PR people on their toes.
It may be added that in such crisis situations, even the CEO takes the role of PR person for the fi rm.
<p>Public relations covers all the communications of the fi rm except marketing, advertising and
personal selling communications. Public relations can be defi ned as the process of understanding
public attitudes on relevant issues, interpreting these attitudes for management, and then working
either to keep the organisational polices and practices with those attitudes or to modify the attitudes
themselves.
<p>Publicity is only one aspect of a PR job, which covers the making of press releases given regarding
the fi rm&rsquo;s activities and plans. Besides, PR is a useful tool in creating positive ambient cue for the sale
of fi rm&rsquo;s products in the target market segment (see Figure 16.1).
<p>Figure 16.1 Tools for Achieving the Sales Targets
<p>The task of PR is to support the personal selling and advertising efforts in the achievement of sales
targets.
<p>Public relations task in marketing activities is subtle. Nonetheless it is equally important, as through
PR, the fi rm is able to build custom/customer base not as a hard sell exercise, but by gaining customer
support. This is done with great fi nesse and yet by bringing customers on the right side of the fi rm:
You like us, you buy from us.
<p>The main features of PR are as follows:
<p>1. When fi rms arrange PR activities, they do not have total control on the message being sent out.
It becomes the prerogative of the editors of the media and they can surely use their right. In
personal selling or in marketing/advertising, the fi rm says only good things about the product.
In the case of PR, the media can express their likes and dislikes in their reports and not just
what the fi rm wants them to do.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Public Relations 419
<p>2. Public relations is addressed to several different classes of people, the customers being one
of them. The message goes to the fi rm&rsquo;s stakeholders, the buyers, the sellers, the investors, banks,
the government, local bodies, trade associations and social activists like environment protection
groups. It pays to keep these people on the fi rm&rsquo;s right side.
<p>3. Public relations does not have any direct media cost as the PR message goes in the form of
media editorials. No media space or time needs to be purchased for PR.
<p>4. Public relations, besides assisting in improving sales, also performs a number of pre-planned
tasks like improving investors&rsquo; interest in the fi rm. Labour relations and activities connected
with labour welfare get publicity through PR.
<p>5. The most visible role of PR is seen during annual general meetings of the shareholders of fi rms.
The entire programme is managed by the PR department of the fi rm.
<p>THE PR BASE
<p>Firms have plans for marketing and advertising with properly laid down objectives. In the same
way they should have plans and objectives for PR activities. The main objectives of marketing are to
increase market share, enlarge geographic base and train the salespersons.
<p>Objectives of PR
<p>One of the objectives of PR is two-way communication between a fi rm&rsquo;s management and its public,
as can be seen from Figure 16.2.
<p>Figure 16.2 Role of PR in a Firm
<p>The PR department, therefore, is not only the custodian of a fi rm&rsquo;s information base, but also plays
a dynamic role in ensuring that public opinion moulded in favour of the fi rm.
<p>An example of the effect of PR activities or lack of them will clarify the point:
<p>In the 1960s, the Bangalore-based, excellent public sector fi rm, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd,
manufactured small aircrafts used for spraying insecticides over vast expanses of agricultural
land. Some of these aircrafts crash-landed due to some technical problem and this good fi rm
went into disrepute. It took a lot of PR work for the company to be recognised again by the
people as a major technology-driven fi rm.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management420
<p> As against this, at about the same time, an American fi rm operating in India came to know
that its aviation turbo fuel (ATF) had got a tiny trace of extra moisture than specifi ed. The fi rm
promptly downgraded the ATF as kerosene oil and gave prominent PR advertisements in this
regard thus gaining mileage from what could have been a disastrous situation for the company.
The high image of the fi rm in the public&rsquo;s mind carried the day for the fi rm.
<p>For this purpose it becomes the foremost task of the PR department of any fi rm to keep its eyes
and ears close to the ground and plan proactive interaction rather than trying to retrieve lost ground
on any account.
<p>Public relations has to coordinate between public opinion and the fi rm&rsquo;s plans and policies. This
would help even at the last minute for taking corrective action if needed. Most fi rms are aware of the
strong sentiments of the public towards the environment and towards pollution control. As fi rms
take measures in the direction of becoming non-polluting industries, they should keep the public
informed about their actions in this regard. Plans and policies are not enough as the public wants to
know the action fi rms are taking. Firms need to address other socially-relevant issues like growing
more trees, adopting parks for maintaining green areas of the town. Firms are corporate citizens of the
country and it is imperative that they behave as such. It is equally important to let the public know
that fi rms are responsible corporate citizens and this is achieved through PR.
<p>As new competitive fi rms start operating, they can, with a little effort, develop a good public
image. Even if your fi rm&rsquo;s image has been good so far, where does it stand in the competition today?
The best way to answer the question is to have a survey conducted and after that take any corrective
measures as required.
<p>With the advent in India of several reputed international television (TV) brands like Aiwa, Sony,
Thomson and LG, fi rms like Videocon and BPL would have taken a bigger beating but for their good
public image. Hence, you can imagine that the task of PR is endless.
<p>As a marketing mix factor, PR has to come up with the most signifi cant factor of the fi rm, which
is promoting sales of goods. This is done mainly through press releases, which tell about the fi rm&rsquo;s
achievements, plans and changes being brought about for increasing effi ciency and customer
satisfaction. These press releases play a vital role perhaps much greater than direct advertising as
these items when published in the newspapers come under editorial purview and hence get greater
credibility than advertising. The only danger is of the editorial pencil which may remove even the
punch lines and make the whole thing drab.
<p>Firms gain good mileage through their brand equity. With high brand equity, fi rms can charge
higher prices and still sell in large quantities. It is the name that sells in most cases. The name provides
the guarantee of quality. For people for whom price is of no consequence, brand is what they buy.
Even price conscious people buy products of good brands for the value for money they provide
and product life thus rendering them economical to the buyers.
<p>Damage control is a major responsibility of PR. This task usually needs to be performed only
once in a while. But it must be done well as not handling it properly could lead to greater disaster.
Natural calamities like fl oods and earthquakes cause problems for fi rms, but how fi rms deal with the
problems and what the public&rsquo;s perception about it is of great importance to fi rms. Then there are
man-made problems like the Bhopal gas leak. Smaller hazards keep on plaguing fi rms and only good
PR can nullify the negative effect of these on the fi rm&rsquo;s image. A negative image could have a bad rub
off on a fi rm&rsquo;s sales and profi ts. It is the reputation and goodwill of the fi rm which is at stake!
<p>Marketing research helps in understanding the difference in perception about the fi rm&rsquo;s com-
munication to the public as against the perception with which the fi rm sent the communication and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Public Relations 421
<p>to know the correctness of the communication. Understanding the nature of public acceptance will
help the PR manager to tailor the next message according to the corrections required.
<p>As we have seen, the objectives of PR are different from those of advertising. Public relations has
to project the public view of the fi rm in the fi rst instance. Public relation managers are in constant
contact with the public, the opinion leaders, the government and the customers. These contacts provide
knowledge about the attitudes of people and the PR person has to be alert to catch even stray phrases
that might be of signifi cance to the fi rm.
<p>One problem which many fi rms face is that they are perceived as being laid-back fi rms. Philips had
this image till the 1980s. The PR department at Philips worked very hard to change this image.
<p>When readers read any article from the editors it has a different effect on them than seeing
advertisements.
<p>Earlier, the success of a PR campaign was measured by the column centimetre space it could get
in the favoured media. The bigger the space, the better the PR. It does not, however, tell you the effect
the space gained has on the public mindset. The ultimate test, as in the case of advertising comes from
an increase in sales fi gures and change for the better in the customer&rsquo;s attitude towards its product.
For understanding the attitude changes, research similar to advertising research is required.
<p>Unlike advertising research, where the target segment is the group of customers likely to purchase
the fi rm&rsquo;s products, in the case of PR, the public consists of investors, stockholders, customers and
suppliers towards whom the PR effort is directed (Figure 16.3).
<p>Figure 16.3 PR Impact on Firm&rsquo;s Stakeholders
<p>The PR manager&rsquo;s job is to have a fi rm grip on the media available for transmitting the message to
the public. Understanding media thus is an important aspect of his job. In this case, the PR manager
approaches the media editors, correspondents with information about the fi rm, its activities and plans.
This is useful information, which makes the media and the PR interdependent.
<p>These days a lot of advertising uses direct attack on competition, which if not refuted can create
misinformation among the customers. Two competitive toothpaste brands made competing claims
about how long they kept a person&rsquo;s mouth fresh&mdash;10 hours said one fi rm and soon the competitor
said 15 hours. A PR job would have suffi ced to sort out the issue. The consumer could be made aware
of the actual effectiveness of the toothpaste through editorial comments.
<p>With the plethora of non-banking fi nancial company (NBFC), to gain advantage one such fi rm
advertised the norms the public should use to assess NBFC fi rms. The advertisement had a reverse
effect as many people who read it out of context felt that that particular NBFC was not a good one. It
took a lot of effort as also their PR team&rsquo;s rapport with the press that helped them in retrieving the
situation and giving their side of the story as a press release.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management422
<p>Public relations too depends on endorsements to an extent. If a fi rm says in its advertisement
that their car is the best in its range, the public may or may not accept the statement. The thinking
becomes that &lsquo;any way it is their advertisement and who will ever say anything bad about their
product&rsquo;. However, if Murad Ali Baig were to say the same thing or the editor of Motoring Times says
it, the public is surely going to believe it.
<p>Marketing efforts too get a boost with the help of marketing PR activities. A technical short fi lm
shows how a car engine gets corroded because of friction between the cylinder walls and the piston
rings. Next it shows a good brand of lubricating oil being used that halves the corrosion. And then
the fi lm shows the fi rm&rsquo;s brand being used, which totally removes any possibility of corrosion. The
fi lm does a subtle job of marketing PR as the visuals leave a lasting impression on the viewers about
the effi cacy of the oil.
<p>Public relations helps in image building. Every fi rm wants to be known as a good corporate citizen.
When the public is shown a movie which highlights the efforts taken by a fi rm in removing pollutants
from its effl uents, it endorses the public opinion about the fi rm as a good corporate citizen. Such fi lms
help mould the opinion when negative opinions have already been formed. The following will give
other examples of PR, which incidentally create goodwill for the fi rm, which does get refl ected in the
sale of its products:
<p>1. The CEO of a fi rm presenting a cheque of Rs 1 million for the Gujarat Relief Fund to the prime
minister of India.
<p>2. The marketing director presenting specially-designed cars for handicapped people at a dis-
counted price.
<p>3. The president of a fi rm sponsoring and inaugurating a sports event for the blind.
4. A fi rm offering scholarships to deserving children of its workers for higher studies.
<p>Such events if not given the right kind of publicity would go unheard and unsung. It becomes
the major task of the PR department to ensure that the good deed does rub off on the cash register
of the fi rm, bringing in extra profi table sales.
<p>It is said a company is known by the men it keeps. And how? Good, happy, hard working employees
do provide a good general backdrop in the public&rsquo;s mind. Firms go out of their way these days to keep
their employees happy. Perquisites like good housing, medical aid for the family, sports activities and
children&rsquo;s education are a must for this purpose. The PR manager&rsquo;s job is to focus the public&rsquo;s atten-
tion on the theme of happy workmen. The fi rm automatically gets a reputation as a good fi rm. Good
employees make for a good fi rm and everyone is interested in doing business with a good fi rm. A good
example of personnel PR is the advertisement of Tata Steels, in which happy employees are shown to
be involved in various activities. In the end the advertisement says, &lsquo;We also make steel&rsquo;.
<p>FIRMS AND SOCIETY
<p>Firms do have some dependence on the society in which they operate. They get their employees,
investments and home sub-assemblers from it. Society too gets employment opportunities and better
living standards, thanks to the fi rm. Mankapur, a backward area in Uttar Pradesh got a big boost
when a public sector fi rm, ITI, established it factory there with French collaboration. What was once
a sleepy laid-back village was transformed into a thriving industrial town. ITI had the opportunity of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Public Relations 423
<p>building its image as a big benevolent corporate citizen. The fact that they did everything to protect
the environment of the area was surely a plus point.
<p>Firms do good to the community and the society in which they operate. The PR department has
to press home the advantage and get the right mileage which is due to the fi rms.
<p>PR AND THE GOVERNMENT
<p>In the era prior to 1992, when the Government of India opened up the country&rsquo;s economy, private
business was overloaded with government liaison work. The government&rsquo;s lowly-paid staff doled out
permits and licenses and it became the breeding ground for corrupt politicians and public servants.
With the change brought about in 1992, fi rms no longer face the same problems with the government
as they once did. Yet, there are areas, which still need to be smoothened out, and interaction with the
government becomes a primary task of the PR department of any fi rm.
<p>The industry lobby, with industry trade associations like ASSOCHAM, CII, FICCI liaise with the
government to sort out their problems.
<p>THE INVESTING PUBLIC
<p>Investments as equity and bonds are made in the fi rms you can trust. Hence the PR task for investors
is the same as for the marketing PR. Investment PR is a highly-specialised job which entails a thorough
knowledge of the money market, interest rates prevailing in the market, thorough knowledge of a
fi rm&rsquo;s fi nancial position and needs. A PR person has to market the fi rm&rsquo;s fi nancial status to encourage
the investing public to invest in the fi rm. Investment PR requires that information about the investors
should be provided to the fi rm and information about the fi rm to the investing public.
<p>What are the means available to the investment PR managers to provide accurate and fast infor-
mation to the investing public?
<p>Press Releases
<p>These are the most commonly used methods of disseminating information. The fi rm selects the in-
formation to be given, then it is written down in a language normally used in the press. You can use
a report format or the format used by journalists. If it is given in the form of a good news coverage
then the chances of its being read by the public are high.
<p>Press Conferences
<p>When the fi rms have to say a great deal, like when they have to announce the annual fi nancial report
and balance sheet, fi rms have their annual general meetings (AGM) where the press is invited. Unlike in </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management424
<p>press releases, in press conferences the media can ask questions to elicit replies to reconfi rm their
thinking and be objective about the fi rm. Besides AGMs, fi rms call press conferences at product
launches and during public issues of their fi rm.
<p>Crisis Management
<p>When a fi rm faces a situation like a strike or a natural calamity, it must inform the stakeholders includ-
ing its shareholders. Non-information leads to speculations and this leads to misinformation with
disastrous results. It is the ability of the PR department to provide appropriate information during a
crisis which helps a fi rm tide over the crisis with the least damage to its reputation and its sales.
<p>SUMMARY
<p>Public relations deals with public opinion and informs the fi rm about the same. It also tells the public
about the results, plans and policies of the fi rm. It helps the fi rm in coordinating its activities to keep
it in tune with the public&rsquo;s likes and dislikes. It can help the fi rm in moulding public opinion in its
favour. Public relations is used to help in selling products as also in managing crisis situations.
<p>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
<p>1. Crisis management is the job of PR. Discuss.
2. Corporate PR and marketing PR are different. How?
3. A well-planned public relations exercise can improve a company&rsquo;s brand equity in a greater measure
<p>than its advertising campaign. Discuss.</p>

<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
With the market economy almost encompassing the whole world, companies need to know the exact
market situation in their selected host countries. For this purpose, marketing research is required to be
done in the selected countries. International marketing needs huge investments in terms of marketing
mix factors and therefore the money spent on marketing research is well justifi ed. In this chapter
students will learn the methods of conducting marketing research in the international arena.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management426
<p>With limited market information, companies face the following problems:
<p>1. Wrong product selection.
2. Wrong pricing plans.
3. Wrong channels of distribution.
4. Wrong methods of communication including wrong advertising, promotion and PR.
<p>The best way to conduct marketing research in the international market is similar to marketing
research conducted in the domestic market, which is as follows:
<p> 1. Identify the problem in marketing or opportunities.
2. Selection of research methods to be used.
3. Identify the information requirements.
4. Identify both the secondary and primary sources.
5. Make the research design plan.
6. Secondary data collection.
7. Primary data collection.
8. Tabulation.
9. Data analysis, interpretation of the data.
10. Recommendations arising out of the analysis.
11. Report writing.
<p>International marketing research can be defi ned as a method of understanding with great degree
of accuracy the business scenario in another country with a view of locating profi table business po-
tential there for the company&rsquo;s products. An international seller of fax machines got a research done
in India regarding its demand in the early 1970s. However, since the researchers wanted to project a
respectable demand, they gave infl ated fi gures, while the truth was that with a low level of telecom
technology available in the country, even normal telecommunication was diffi cult, leave aside the
clarity of line needed for fax facilities. The company, however, got in touch with telecom experts and
decided to delay the introduction of fax machines in India till telecom lines improved.
<p>International marketing research is conducted as it helps initially in screening and selecting
countries, besides calculating each country&rsquo;s market potential. A company will be able to understand
the plus and minus factors associated with doing business in a country with the help of information
generated out of a marketing research. With the help of research, a company can understand the
general business environment as well as the competitive environment of business that prevails in
that country. Research will provide the ideal possible marketing factors like product, price, promotion
and placement. Such analysis can be developed to formulate a marketing plan most suited for the
target country.
<p>Once the research is started, the company has to understand the variations of cross-cultural
behaviour patterns. The exact research process to be used is selected, taking the local language into
considerations as many wrong results emerge from the following areas:
<p>1. Wrong selection of market segment.
2. Sample and sample size errors.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 427
<p>3. Association of country-wide data into a simple solution.
4. Use of expatriates for research, who are not aware of the subtleties of the local language.
5. Difference of cultural ethos, religious blocks, value systems, idea of aesthetics, language and
<p>biases on the basis of a person&rsquo;s sex.
<p>International market research is organised to gain knowledge about:
<p> 1. The market potential, its size on the basis of different demographic factors.
2. Segment and geographic area-wise product demand.
3. Behaviour pattern of consumers in the given market segment.
4. Brand preferences, brand loyalties, possibilities and the basis of shift in brand loyalty.
5. Projection of profi t picture for different market segments.
6. New product launches.
7. Marketing problems.
8. Understanding the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
9. Product innovations, differentiations planned.
10. Competitive strengths and weaknesses.
11. Understanding the levels of product price acceptance by the customers in the target segment.
<p>The researcher gets to know about the product selection process, what will sell and what will
not, in a given market. He also understands the importance of the timing of new product launches.
At times, for unexpected reasons, companies start losing sales and market share, and unless the com-
pany keeps its hand on the pulse of the market, it will never fi nd out the reasons for these downward
trends. Market research can be used to confi rm the effectiveness of the fi rm&rsquo;s marketing strategies.
<p>Companies learn about the products that can be sold in the overseas market without any modi-
fi cation, their market potential in the target country and can therefore generate a profi t and loss
statement for couple of years of operations in the country through marketing research. The company
can decide the amount of money it should invest in marketing.
<p>Companies need to start by gathering secondary data for the target markets/country from their
import statistics. These are usually available from the ministry of trade and overseas business. Trade
bodies and research organisations can be the other sources for information. Historical data of sales
and imports for the past few years (fi ve&ndash;seven years) would be useful as from there the researcher can
extrapolate the trends of sales for the next two years. However, proper weightage needs to be given
to changes in a country&rsquo;s general business and competitive environment, and corrections applied as
required. Markets that may be small but growing rapidly due to a country&rsquo;s political expediencies
should be understood through secondary research.
<p>Based on the fi ndings of a secondary research, the company should plan primary research to get
more authentic and recent data. Once the overall product demand potential has been assessed, it
would be worthwhile to fi nd out the market share of different competitors. A country&rsquo;s demographic
situation can be ascertained from the World Population and Statistical Yearbook&mdash;a publication of the
United Nations.
<p>Internationally, companies compete with host-country companies as well companies from other
countries. Marketing research should highlight buyer&rsquo;s profi le and buying motivations, pricing,
the effectiveness of distribution channels, cultural ethos, and policies and procedures followed by </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management428
<p>competing companies in the country. The research should focus on the entry barriers in the country like
government regulations of the host-country, tariff and non-tariff barriers, patents and patent laws,
availability or lack of trained skilled manpower and raw materials, channels of distribution and the
initial investment required. Host-country governments could have laws that encourage foreign direct
investments (FDIs), or it could be against the smooth entry of foreign companies without overtly being
critical of the entry. The desire to support local businesses can surpass the need to join the market
economy and reap the resultant benefi ts thereof.
<p>Marketing research data needs to be analysed and interpreted resulting in the conclusions
required for making the marketing plans for entering the target country&rsquo;s markets.
<p>The marketing research process involves the following activities as shown in Figure 17.1:
<p>Figure 17.1 Marketing Research Process
<p>International marketing research faces major challenges with respect to consumer behaviour
patterns due to differences in the cultural ambience of the home and the host countries. At times, the
research methods used in the home country may not be applicable in the host country. For instance,
the researcher may not be able to organise focus groups or even research consumer panels in the host
country, which he might be able to do in the home country. Section of samples and its size could be a
critical element that could leave the research disorganised. Linguistic quirks and wrong translations
lead to wrong interpretation of the collected data. In large countries like China and India, even far-
fl ung areas would need different methods of data collection and its interpretation. A country&rsquo;s value
systems, aesthetic sense and cultural milieu provide the backdrop where the research is conducted
and therefore these must form a major focus area for the researchers.
<p>International marketing research can be organised in the following manner. New product intro-
duction can be organised after discussing it in focus groups. Questionnaire-based surveys also help in
formulating decisions about the product. Companies need to test the product benefi ts the customers
are looking for, their attitudes and beliefs towards the product as compared to their thinking about
competitive products. Companies can plan testing the product idea and test market the same. Com-
panies can fi nd out the level of price sensitivity of demand of the product through research, as also the
best method of distributing the product and the favoured channels of the target segment&rsquo;s consumer
groups. Pre-testing of advertising campaigns can be organised for obtaining the best results from the
money spent on international advertising. Surveys can provide information about the most effective
methods of sales promotion for the products.</p>

<p>International Marketing Research 429
<p>Companies do well to understand their information needs before embarking on marketing research
in the international market as these can be an expensive exercise. The possible areas where a company
needs information are as follows:
<p>1. Looking at the statistical records of imports of the company&rsquo;s products, it can decide to go
overseas or stay in the domestic market only. The company can get an estimate of the market
demand and trends in the host country.
<p>2. The company needs to fi nalise the best way to enter the host country. This is possible by under-
standing the entry barriers in the host country. Only after establishing the reasons for entering
the country should the company determine the market segment, its demand pattern, price
factors and possible distribution channels as it starts its advertising campaigns.
<p>3. As the company enters the host country, it must decide the market share, turnover, profi t
projections and the generation of cash fl ows.
<p>4. The host country&rsquo;s import statistics, production capacities and actual production in the last
few years, import duties, import quotas (only where there is a quota system) are important
parameters to have information about. Besides restrictions in terms of currency, its fl uctuations,
political and economic environment, ecology norms and the balance of payment situation are
other important area to have knowledge about.
<p>5. Consumer behaviour and related demands should be found out through the research.
6. The company must have information about channels of distribution, important advertising
<p>agencies, credit norms, transport facilities and packaging standards. Pricing formulas, product
innovations, geographic regions need to be understood by the company as well.
<p>Collecting data through mailed questionnaires is effective in countries like England, Japan,
Switzerland, Singapore and Germany, but is not so useful in countries like Nigeria and the Philippines.
Electronic surveys are cost-effective in Sweden, Korea, USA and Norway.
<p>The three methods of conducting surveys have the following salient features:
<p>1. Personal interviews have a high level of control over respondents and their responses. They
can be used both in urban and rural areas, even with low literacy levels.
<p>2. Telephone interviews too provide a high degree of control. They help in conducting
interviews when it is diffi cult to locate the respondents at home or when there are not enough
interviewers.
<p>3. Mail interviews are useful when reaching homes is a problem and when telephone density is
low.
<p>While research is being conducted to assess the product demand, areas of consumer behaviour
including the cultural ambience need to be interlinked with the research to get the right perspective.
<p>Companies are, at the beginning, unaware of the international market. As far as the domestic mar-
ket is concerned, businessmen have a gut feeling about the market and its trends to a large degree.
This, however, is not true about the international market, which often looks like a black box to a new
entrant. Companies must reduce the risk of market uncertainties by organising proper marketing
research in countries they want to do business in. They need to know whether proper distribution
networks can be established in the country or what type of pricing the customers would accept.
Marketing research helps answering some of these questions and in reducing these uncertainties.
However, there are always constraints of time and money for organising these researches. Hence, an
&lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; enquiry is of great help if conducted by trained researchers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management430
<p>The secondary data available for different countries are not compatible and its comparison can
pose problems. Consumer expenditure in Germany is taken from turnover receipts and in USA,
household surveys and production sources also add to the information base. International market
research has to take multiple countries into account and consider each country&rsquo;s unique market
situations. In low-profi t markets, a major research could prove expensive. In many underdeveloped
countries, data availability is scarce and not reliable.
<p>Companies fi nd that comparing data is fraught with problems because of the different ways the
data has been collected, the time it was collected and the problems that arise out distortions in currency
conversion rates. There could be a major difference in the purpose for which the data was collected
and the expected accuracy levels. The data must be analysed for its timeliness, accuracy, completeness
and the methodology used for collecting the same.
<p>International research needs the following inputs:
<p>1. Ask yourself, what information do I need?
2. Where can I get it in fi les, library or database?
3. Why do I need the information?
4. When do I need it?
5. What is the money value of the information to me?
6. What would be the cost of ignorance?
<p>Some countries have specialised research agencies like ORG Marg in India, which collect specifi ed
data and information that they sell to buyers who are interested in the data. This data could be about
specifi c markets, regions, products or about several of these items. Studies that provide information
about a country&rsquo;s imports and exports are usually available from the country&rsquo;s government. Trade
organisations like FICCI, ASSOCHAM and CII in India, and such others worldwide, publish a lot of
data relevant to their country&rsquo;s commerce and trade both internal and international. Government
agencies like the Directorate of Advertising &amp; Visual Publicity (DAVP) in India bring out yearly
almanacs and other literature with data and facts about the country&rsquo;s commerce. The export promotion
boards are other sources of information needed by international marketers. International organisation
like the WTO, IMF and the World Bank, have large research units in each country that gather trade-
related information. Several countries provide active governmental support for international marketers
and the government arranges for the required data to be available to international marketers.
<p>The latest and the most important of databases are now available at the click of the mouse through
the internet. Information on the internet is usually available on a real time basis as it is updated online.
Google and other websites offer a huge amount of information online.
<p>Besides these sources of information, multinational corporations (MNCs) arrange for marketing
research in the different countries where they intend to conduct a market probe. The travelling
executives of these companies are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the company. They watch the
markets, store the information, which is then analysed, classifi ed and stored in the company&rsquo;s databank
for use. Field research conducted in the international markets needs a thorough knowledge of the
country, its culture and economic standards for it to be of real use. For example, competition in shoes
in some countries could come from the local town cobblers rather than any known brand. In Kolkata,
for example, there are a number of excellent Chinese cobblers operating from small shops that compete
with the big brands and they succeed due to their special talent in craftsmanship and in designing
shoes for the wearer&rsquo;s comfort.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 431
<p>The database of MNCs covers a wide variety of subjects, different markets, products and know-
ledge of competition that becomes useful once the company decides to open a particular country&rsquo;s
market for its products.
<p>Once the company has acquired or got the relevant market information, it has to understand the
opportunities. These need to be equated with the risks involved in doing business in that country.
A low-risk country with high opportunities should be the target in the fi rst instance. As the company
gathers experience in international marketing, it can plan entry into medium-risk countries that offer
the next best opportunities.
<p>Secondary research starts from libraries, online database, trade associations and government pub-
lications. Researchers need to fi nd out from foreign embassies about the information available from
their countries. Every piece of information generated must be cross-checked with other sources.
<p>Survey research is conducted by using a questionnaire and asking questions from potential
customers. The questionnaires should be simple, be easy to answer and be easy to record. Questions
should be clear and to the point.
<p>A company planning to get into international markets need to analyse the countries it wants to
select after research and then place these countries in a matrix as given in Table 17.1. The countries
should be rated on a scale of 1&ndash;5 scale, on the following parameters on the matrix:
<p>Table 17.1 Country Ratings
<p>Investment in marketing Country A Country B Country C Country D
<p>Transport costs
Taxation rates
Market size
Market size after fi ve years
Current/possible market share
Market share after fi ve years
Market loss due to expected
<p>competition in next fi ve years
Currency rate problems
Political risks
Business laws of the country
Possible future laws
<p>The matrix would bring out the best option(s) the company has for going into international markets.
Next, the company can build a matrix describing the countries attractiveness as a market and its
<p>competitive strengths, as shown in Table 17.2:
<p>Table 17.2 Country&rsquo;s Market Attractiveness and Competitive Company Strength
<p>High Medium Low
<p>High Country&rsquo;s attractiveness Invest and grow Dominate in the market
Medium Make country specifi c strategies
Low Make country specifi c strategies Harvest/divest</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management432
<p>Companies have to plan their initial operations in countries appearing in top left corner of the
matrix. Once the company has established itself in one country, it has to select from the following
two options to increase its business:
<p>1. Consolidate its market in the country with intensive marketing plans.
2. Diversify in other countries that have similar markets and business environments.
<p>The research should give the following information:
<p>1. Demand analysis is dependent on a country&rsquo;s gross national product, per capita income. Low-
income countries focus on core products like food and clothing, while high-income countries
concentrate on heavy industries.
<p>2. Income elasticity of demand can be found out both for consumer and industrial products.
Basic necessities do not have much of income elasticity, while the demand for luxuries changes
with changes in income.
<p>A country&rsquo;s entry barriers are listed next and these will confi rm whether or not its market is
conducive for entry:
<p>1. Government regulations regarding foreign fi rms.
2. Low infrastructure like telephones, power, roads, railways and ports.
3. Poor availability of raw materials.
4. High cost of money, borrowing rates.
5. High rate of import duties.
<p>RESEARCH PLAN
A company that wants to conduct a marketing research has to establish research methods to be adopted
and the information gathering process. Research could be of the following types:
<p>1. Exploratory research: This is used for getting initial information. It takes less time and money
and can at best be indicative of the trends. The research supports theories and can prepare a
hypothesis on the basis of which detailed research can be carried out to confi rm the same.
<p>2. Descriptive research: This is more like a census where a large body of respondents are contacted
to get the answers to certain queries. Such research is carried out to fi nd out market demands
and trends. Since a large respondent base is used, these researches are more accurate and they
lead to marketing decisions on the objectives of the research.
<p>3. Causal research: This form of research takes the cause and effect relationship, like the effect on
sales of increasing product price.
<p>For students of marketing it is important to understand the theory and practical applications of
market research. This material will provide the students an insight into the vital aspect of market
research in an easy to understand language without the clutter of market research jargon. With a view
to making reading interesting, several examples have been included. Also included are a number of
case studies for getting a feel of real life situations.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 433
<p>Market research is associated with primary research for most beginners. However, as we know,
market research starts with secondary research, which can be conducted by looking at an immense
amount of data already available somewhere and we need to locate it. Secondary data can provide
valuable information regarding market size and historical and future growth patterns.
<p>Qualitative research is an integral part of market research. It helps in product development,
design and modifi cation. It can also assist in locating the right market segment for the products, as
qualitative research directs us towards the customer&rsquo;s mindsets, both theoretically as well as in the
real life corporate world.
<p>INTRODUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL MARKET RESEARCH
<p>Marketing has become an all-pervasive discipline so much so that no business or industry can remain
untouched by marketing. In the good old days, when there were only a handful of manufacturers of a
product, competition was limited or just not there. Marketing as we understand it today was a luxury
only as it was not required. Manufacturers made the products and sold it in the market. The stress was
on sales. In India, even up to the 1960s, manufacturers were confi dent of selling their products at a
profi t without the fear of anybody undercutting them as there was enough business for all. Competi-
tion increased, especially after India liberalised its economy and the fl oodgates of international players
were opened. Now, competition has become a vital force that every business has to reckon with.
<p>With increased competition, fi rms need to play their cards according to the competition and mar-
ket condition. Hence, the need to systematically understand competition, market conditions and
market research!
<p>Let us take an example. When you want to buy an expensive thing like a motorcycle, how would
you decide to go about it? Most likely you will take some of these steps:
<p>1. Check out the different brands available by visiting motorcycle dealers.
2. Compare the prices, specifi cations like the horse power of the machine, after-sales service and
<p>the dealer&rsquo;s attitude towards customers.
3. Ask your relatives, friends and colleagues who own bikes about their experiences and views
<p>about different bikes.
4. Look for advertisements in different media like newspapers, magazines and TV to get as much
<p>information as you can about motorcycles.
5. See your budget and then take a decision based on the information gathered.
<p>In the same way, as a seller, it is important to know what product the buyer wants, where he
wants it, what price he is ready to pay for the product, how he would like to pay for it&mdash;by credit card,
cash, cheque or through some hire-purchase arrangement. Getting the answers to these questions
is the task of market research.
<p>Let us examine what constitutes marketing in the twenty-fi rst century. To start with let us again
understand the marketing mix factors as given next:
<p> 1. Market research (including market survey and analysis): This factor, as will be seen, is used
for taking decisions about virtually all other marketing mix factors.
<p> 2. Product.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management434
<p> 3. Brand.
4. Packaging.
5. Trademark.
6. Logo.
7. Label.
8. Price.
9. Placement or distribution.
10. Promotion.
11. Advertising.
12. Credit and its control.
13. Personal selling.
14. Training of the fi rm&rsquo;s and its retailers&rsquo; marketing personnel.
<p>Items 3&ndash;7 are directly related to the product.
As already stated, market research can be undertaken for any of the factors mentioned earlier.
<p>Besides, market research is conducted to get information about the total market potential, its pos-
sible growth and the strengths and weaknesses of the competition in respect to the marketing mix
factors.
<p>Starting with the product, market research can be conducted to get information about the trends
in the following areas:
<p>1. Is there a demand for the product?
2. If yes, in which market segment?
3. What is the level of demand?
4. Is there a demand in peripheral segments? If yes, then what is its level?
5. Is the product acceptable to the market as it is, or is any modifi cation necessary?
6. Are the product package, brand, trademark, label and logo eye-catching enough?
7. Is the package size acceptable?
<p>At this point, student&rsquo;s can pick up an FMCG product and get the market information about its
acceptance with respect to any marketing mix factor between points 3&ndash;7. They may ask only four&ndash;fi ve
of their close friends or relatives.
<p>Market research can be conducted to ascertain the market acceptability of price vis-&agrave;-vis a compe-
titive product and its price. It may be important to know the hidden costs of competition, like extra
money for immediate delivery and lower discount levels for distribution channels. Most dealers of
competitive products try to play one against the other by implying that your competitor is paying
higher discounts while the case may be just the reverse.
<p>In pricing it is of utmost importance to fi nd out the real competitive price and also to know if the
products under comparison have similar if not the same specifi cations or if it is a case of comparing
apples with oranges?
<p>Higher prices, as we know, can be charged by fi rms for better products, immediate delivery and
better brand name (higher brand equity). Yet, to be sure of the right price to be charged for your
product, it is best to conduct market research and be sure that you are making reasonable profi ts and
not losing money by undercutting on price.
<p>Coming to placement or distribution channels, it is normally believed that for a given product there is a
set distribution channel. However, now with the advent of several new channels, it may be worthwhile
to make sure that you are using the most appropriate channel(s). Internet marketing, teleshopping </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 435
<p>and telemarketing are some of the newer ways of placing the product in the market. The choice of
channel will depend on the product and the market segment you are going to cater to.
<p>Advertising and promotion need to be planned carefully, as a lot of money is spent in this area. Natur-
ally, a wise marketer would like to consider the best way to promote and advertise his or her product.
Due to the special signifi cance of advertising research, it will be discussed at length later on.
<p>Market research can be compared to an army spy network, which gathers information about the
enemy so that strategies can be made to defeat the enemy.
<p>Advertising has been defi ned by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as &lsquo;the gathering,
recording and analyzing of all data about problems relating to the transfer and sale of goods and
services from producer to consumer.&rsquo;
<p>Market research ultimately builds a databank or creates an information system for the fi rm to
remain proactive in the market place and acquire and maintain its position. Since the market, com-
petition and customer needs are ever-changing in today&rsquo;s business, it is important to have dynamic
and continuous market research in the organisation.
<p>Here, we can differentiate between market research and market information system (MIS) as
follows:
<p>1. Market research is mainly used for fi nding solutions while MIS, in addition to fi nding solu-
tions, helps prevent problems from occurring.
<p>2. While both are continuous processes, market research is usually conducted on the basis of
problem solution in the area of marketing.
<p>3. Market research provides external information while MIS is mostly for internal data.
<p>People sometimes confuse market research with marketing research. Let us see how marketing
guru Richard D. Crips defi nes them:
<p>Marketing research is the systematic, objective and exhaustive research, for the study of the
facts relevant to any problem in the fi eld of marketing. Market research is restricted to the study
of actual and potential buyers, their location, their actual and potential value of purchases and
their motives and habits.
<p>Let us examine the process involved in conducting marketing research.
The signifi cant elements of the marketing research process results can be shown as given in

<p>MARKETING RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
<p>From the viewpoint of the marketing manager, the most useful role of market research is in the area of
market demand and supply, in ever changing, mostly growing market and increasing competition.
<p>It is important to defi ne market research objectives as the starting point of market research. The
accuracy of the objective defi nition would be the key factor in the accuracy of market research fi ndings.
The main objectives of market research are:
<p>1. Demand projection for the product in a given area for an acceptable period like one year. This
takes into account the historical demand of past years, market dynamics and changing business
environment.
<p>2. Competitive activities, product differentiation, entry barriers.
3. Competitive market share.
4. Brand positions.
5. Competitive prices vis-&agrave;-vis brand equity.
6. Advertising and promotional strengths of the competition.
<p>The next range of market research objectives are in the area of customers needs, as given next:
<p>1. What product benefi ts customers are seeking.
2. Product usage with different customer groups, light or heavy usage.
3. Top of the mind recall.
4. Price and quality perceptions.
5. Purchase decision procedures, who are the persons involved in it.
6. Reasons for brand preferences.
<p>Let us see the types of market research being conducted:
<p>1. Exploratory research is conducted to confi rm thoughts and ideas. Since these are conducted
in small areas, they are low in cost and they take less time.
<p>2. Statistical research deals with frequency of events like purchase action. Such research pro-
vides inputs for analysis, as the variables for the research are pre-decided such as how often
car batteries are changed in Maruti cars, the time required and brand of batteries being the
variables.
<p>3. Casual research is conducted on a case-to-case basis, like the effect of price changes on product
sales.
<p>Primary market research or market survey is conducted by collecting data or information directly
from the consumers. Before launching on a full-scale survey, which entails heavy expenditure, it is
advisable to conduct a sample survey where the survey is conducted in a limited area to test the methods
used. Both qualitative and quantitative information can be gathered through market surveys.
<p>The survey can be conduced in several ways as follows:
<p>1. Observation method: If you want to know the number of vehicles polluting the atmosphere in
Delhi, you could stand near congested crossing and observe polluting vehicles for a month or </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 437
<p>so which would give you enough information as a sample survey. More detailed information
would take much more time, many more crossings to observe and persons observing polluting
vehicles. Cameras and other signal-gathering devices can be used like smoke detectors, speed
sensors for knowing the average speed of vehicles passing through a particular point.
<p>2. Personal interviews: In this method, you with your team meet a number of users personally,
ask them questions as per a predetermined questionnaire and get fi rst-hand information from
them. The information collected is then used to extrapolate for the entire customer group to
get real answers. These surveys are time consuming and expensive, but more accurate. These
questionnaire methods will be discussed at length later on.
<p>3. Mail surveys: These are conducted by sending a questionnaire to a number of customers with
a request for fi lling them and returning them to the surveyor. The method is not expensive, but
it may not give accurate results, as the rate of getting replies from customers is poor. Also the
information which comes in may be skewed as people, when replying to such questionnaires,
tend to give infl ated fi gures.
<p>4. Telephone surveys: These are conducted as a low-cost, easy method of gathering information.
The problem in such surveys is the fact that people replying to telephone calls may not be the
right persons.
<p>MARKETING RESEARCH METHODS
<p>There are two basic methods of doing marketing research:
<p>1. Primary research
2. Secondary research
<p>As normally secondary research is done fi rst, we will discuss it fi rst. Sources of secondary data
are:
<p> 1. A fi rm&rsquo;s internal source including its profi t and loss statements, inventory levels, sales visit
reports and previous market research reports.
<p> 2. Incoming staff members who may be coming from competitive fi rms.
3. Government publications and notifications like those from the DAVP and research
<p>organisations.
4. Each trade has its own journals which carry information about the historical business and
<p>projections. There are several magazines exclusively on computers, information technology,
electronics, cinema, TV, agriculture, science and technology, dress designing, interior
decoration and practically every possible area of business in the market.
<p> 5. Competitor&rsquo;s balance sheets.
6. Publications of industry associations like FICCI, CII and ASSOCHAM.
7. All India Management Association journal.
8. Trade and business newspapers and magazines like Financial Times, Business Today and
<p>Business India.
9. The internet.
10. Market research organisations like ORG Marg which sell market research reports at a price.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management438
<p>11. Sales statistics of the product&rsquo;s dealers.
12. Publications of the Reserve Bank of India and fi nancial institutions like IFCI, IDBI, ICICI
<p>and UTI.
13. Foreign government data and international publications help in the area of international
<p>business, as also at the introductory stage of products, as they can tell about the rate of product
penetration in other countries as a benchmark for India. Of course, other economic parameters,
which may differentiate the countries, will have to be kept in mind.
<p>Secondary data, as the name itself suggests, is the data for which somebody else has collected
information as primary data.
<p>At this stage it may be a good idea for students to get some secondary market survey data,
by gathering information from libraries, where old copies of newspapers, magazines and other
publications are available. (You may also list down as many secondary sources as possible from where
you can get the data.) Please collect information about any one of the following:
<p>1. Mid-size car price variation in the last three years.
2. Introduction of new brands of washing powders in the last three years.
3. New distribution systems in the area of consumer durables.
<p>To get an idea about the objectives let us take Surf Excel as the product. You can fi nd out the
following from your respondents (persons you are going to talk to about the product):
<p>1. Reasons why housewives prefer the product.
2. What types of housewives are likely to use the product?
3. In a given area how many would be using the product?
4. How many more would use it if a cheaper package is used to sell to another segment at a lower
<p>rate?
5. Besides package and price what are the other factors that help the buyer to decide in favour of
<p>the product?
<p>Once the objectives are well defi ned, it is important to go to the source of the data.
Focus group research is conducted by inviting around 10 people from the market segment of the
<p>product, to get to know their views about the product, its price and channels of distribution. The ex-
pert conductor of the meeting will ask them, &lsquo;What do you think about the quality of Surf Excel&rsquo;.
With free and easy dialogue, and without the burden of their family&rsquo;s presence, people come out and
give their frank opinions.
<p>The questionnaire method can be used for collecting information in the case of Surf Excel. The
questionnaire might consist of relevant questions, which the respondents can easily answer. It is
the most common and effective way of getting answers as it means direct contact with the user and the
marketers get the answers to questions that are baffl ing them.
<p>The questionnaire consists of questions, which are of a closed type, where options are provided
and the respondent has to just give his choice from among the options given. The questions can be
asked in the following manner:
<p>1. Yes/No type, for example, &lsquo;did you personally select the product?&rsquo; Yes/no.
2. Multiple choice, for example, &lsquo;who helped you in the selection?&rsquo; Brother/sister/uncle/
<p>friend.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 439
<p>3. Answers are given on a fi ve point scale, for example:
<p>1. I like the Surf Excel very much.
2. I like it all right.
3. I barely like it.
4. I do not like it.
5. I do not like it at all.
<p>The fi rst part of the questionnaire consists of demographic information about the respondent.
A sample is given next:
<p>Name: ___________________________________
Address: ______________________________________ Phone/fax/e-mail: __________________
Age (below 25/25&ndash;40/41&ndash;60/60+): _____________________
Income/per month (below Rs 5,000/5,001 &ndash;15,000/15,001&ndash;30,000/30,001&ndash;50,000/50,001&ndash;80,000/
80001+): _____________________________
Family size (below 3/3 &ndash;5/6&ndash;9): ________________________
<p>People fi nd it easier to give a range for age and income rather than giving accurate fi gures, as it could
be less embarrassing.
<p>Questionnaires should be carefully developed, tested through a sample test, modifi ed as required
and then used for gathering information. Questions can, at times, infl uence the answers. Hence, to
make them totally objective, they should be carefully prepared. Close-ended questions, like giving
answer choices, guide the respondent into the area with which the researcher is familiar. Open-ended
questions get the respondents to use their own words and individualistic replies come from such
questions. Such questions are useful in exploratory type of market research. However, if time is an
important factor, it is better to ask close-ended questions, which can be answered more quickly. Open-
ended question could be: &lsquo;what is your opinion about Surf Excel as a detergent powder?&rsquo; or &lsquo;what is
the fi rst name which comes to your mind when you think of detergents?&rsquo; or the interviewer shows the
respondent an extra clean used shirt and asks, &lsquo;what does the shirt remind you of?&rsquo; The interviewer
could also show the respondent a picture of Surf Excel and asks, &lsquo;what can it do for you?&rsquo;
<p>Questions should be as simple as possible, direct and to the point, with no possibility of any
ambiguity. The questions should follow a pattern, a logical sequence.
<p>It is time that students prepare a questionnaire for conducting market research for any one of the
following products:
<p>1. A car
2. Cosmetics
3. Readymade garments
<p>The student can select a brand and build the questionnaire around that brand.
Testing the questionnaire needs to be done next. For this purpose, a small sample is adequate.
<p>It should be from the market segment for which the product is meant. If any question is found to
be diffi cult or objectionable it should be modifi ed or removed. A mix of 20&ndash;25 respondents should
normally be suffi cient for test purposes.
<p>A sample questionnaire is given next:</p>

<p>Thanks!
<p>Now it is time to understand, what we are going to survey? Who is the target audience? Defi ning
the market segment and the right geographic area gives us the parameters along which we have to
organise the survey. We call it the universe or the population for the purpose of market research. The
universe or the total population for Surf Excel would be the entire middle and high-income group
of a town.
<p>Organising a market survey for the entire universe can, and usually is, a time-consuming and
expensive process. It may take so much time meeting and asking questions from a million people that
by the time the results appear, the product itself may become obsolete. Therefore, the survey is done
on the basis of a sample of the universe, which is made using well-established techniques.
<p>Sample Size
<p>The larger the number of people interviewed, the better or more reliable the results. However, in
practice, it is better to cover a much smaller sample, may be 1 per cent of the universe to get reasonably
good results, with less time and money spent. It really depends on how the sample gets selected.
<p>Sample Selection
<p>There can be two ways of selecting a sample: Probability sample and Non-probability sample.
<p>PROBABILITY SAMPLE
<p>It ensures that each member of the universe has an equal chance or probability of being selected for
the survey. It helps in understanding the levels of error on account of the sample selected. There are
three ways of probability sampling:
<p>1. Simple random sample: Every member has an equal opportunity of being in the survey.
2. Stratifi ed random survey: The population/universe is divided into mutually-exclusive groups
<p>such as age and income, and then random samples are taken from each group.
3. Cluster sample: The population is divided as per geographic divisions. For example, Delhi
<p>could be divided into north, south, east, west and central zones and a sample taken from each
zone on a random basis.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 443
<p>NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLE
<p>As the cost and time involved in probability sample surveys is quite high, market research people
use non-probability sample. This can be done in three ways:
<p>1. Convenience sample: The research person selects the persons most easily met for the market
research.
<p>2. Judgement sample: The researcher uses his judgement about the sample, which would provide
the most accurate answers.
<p>3. Quota sample: The researcher meets with a set of persons in each category.
<p>As an example, in sampling methods, if one person is not available, then no one else takes his
place, except in the quota sample method, where the researcher has to fi nd out another person in the
same category and meet him.
<p>At times, even with proper sampling, errors creep into the collected data. The reasons for such
errors are:
<p>1. A portion of the population may have been omitted.
2. People not included in the sample may differ widely from those interviewed.
3. Substitute interviewees may not be the right ones if you are not able to meet the person in the
<p>sample.
4. The respondents fi nd the questionnaire diffi cult.
5. The respondents may not have enough information on the subject or they may not like to reveal
<p>it for some reason.
6. Some questions in the questionnaire may have a bias or slant towards one answer.
7. The interviewer may not be fully qualified to take up the job of getting respondents&rsquo;
<p>opinions.
<p>The researcher must take these into account when analysing the collected data.
When the sample is drawn systematically, it helps as data collection cost becomes lower and it is
<p>easy to control.
<p>Planning Samples
<p>Let us plan a sample for EPABX of a large size say which caters to 1,000 lines. Who would be interested
in the EPABX?
<p>1. Industrial units, MNCs, large Indian fi rms, public sector companies.
2. Government departments and offi ces.
3. Research and development laboratories in the private and government sector.
4. Banks, both Indian and foreign and fi nancial institutions.
5. Universities and educational institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the
<p>Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management444
<p>As a starting point, let us get lists of all the organisations in the population group with a turnover
of Rs 50 crore.
<p> Pick up 100 per cent of organisations with a turnover of Rs 500 crore.
Select 20 units from the organisations with a turnover of more than Rs 100 crore but less than
<p>Rs 500 crore.
Select 15 units with a turnover of less than Rs 100 crore.
Pick up all the government departments and their head offi ces.
Likewise select some units from each of the other categories.
<p>To sum up, the sampling technique for EPABX 1,000 can be as follows:
<p>1. Defi ning the population.
2. Sampling unit would be the fi rms and offi ces having population needing about 800 phones.
3. Sample size could be 400.
<p>Task for Students
Develop a questionnaire for the organisations for the EPABX survey.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>According to Philip Kotler, the marketing guru, the characteristics of a good market research are
as follows:
<p> Scientifi c method: Effective market research is conducted on scientifi c lines, with formulation
of hypothesis, theory, testing and results.
<p> Creativity: A teenage clothing fi rm gave video cameras to several young persons, who were
asked to fi lm the discos and restaurants where the teenagers went most of the time.
<p> Multiple-methods: To increase credibility, marketing people use several methods together.
Value and cost of information: Marketing people have to fi nd out the cost&ndash;value ratio of the
<p>market research. For example, if the market research is to fi nd the extra sale on decreasing the
price to some extent and it is found that the cost of research outweighs the profi t benefi t, such
market research should not be undertaken. For example, if the increase in sales is likely to bring
extra profi ts of Rs 1 million and the research is going to cost Rs 1.2 million, it is not worthwhile
to conduct the market research.
<p> Market research managers must take a close look at the assumptions made by the marketing
personnel as they may be lopsided.
<p> Market research should not use the survey to sell the product. Managers, because of the following
reasons, are sparsely using marketing research:
<p> When marketing team has a problem with some options and market research does not pin-
point towards a solution it makes market research of not much use. Only with a well-defi ned
problem can market research provide the right answers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 445
<p> When market research personnel are not fully qualifi ed to do the job, they will not be able
to get the right answers.
<p> Market research takes time to be complete in all respects to give valuable market insight.
When time is not enough, market research may not give correct results.
<p> Market research reports sometimes give only indications, trends and not concrete facts, which
is not appreciated by the marketing team.
<p>Students should plan market research objectives in view of these points and develop a questionnaire
for the same.
<p>Given next is an imaginary discussion between the managing director and marketing manager of
a television manufacturing company, who are scanning the Indian TV market to enter the same after
achieving big success in Western markets like Europe and the US.
<p>Marketing Manager (MM): We have seen the growth of Indian&rsquo;s TV market. In the last
three years, it has been growing at a steady rate of 5 per cent, which is much better than the
fi gure of &ndash;2 per cent in the developed world. However, there are a number of MNCs in the fi eld
like Thomson, Sony, AIWA, Samsung, LG and a number of Japanese fi rms, such as Toshiba, are
well entrenched through selling kits for assembly in India. Now we have to plan our strategy
for entering this growing, yet diffi cult market. What are your ideas on the matter?
<p>Managing Director (MD): I believe there is still big room for players like us who believe in their
product and customised service which no one can provide. You should be trying for at least
7 per cent market share in the second year of our operation.
<p>MM: I would like to organise a market survey to know what the market wants and who would
buy our rather highly priced products.
<p>MD: By all means get your market information updated, keep me informed and let us plan our
marketing strategies based on your information.
<p>Following is the brief the MM gave to the market research agency:
<p>Our information on Indian TV Market is as follows:
<p>In 1986, the market was of 4 million TV sets in the country. More than 75 per cent of these sets
were black and white versions. Colour TV came to India as late as 1982. It was only after the
liberalisation of economy in 1991, that the demand started to grow rapidly. By 2000, 6 million
colour sets were being planned for sale. The growth of manufacturers has been rapid, too.
<p>The growth and competition has brought several changes in the product offerings. Multi-channel,
remote-operated TVs are now available. Several fi rms are making colour TVs. Innovations like
fl at, square screens, picture-in-picture, ambience light adjusters, virtually automatic TV sets
with memory databank of information are in the market. Some features may be yet trying to
fi nd their feet in the market, due to concepts being new and expensive.
<p>You have to fi nd out which of the features and internet access TV, would fi nd a reasonable
demand in the market. We want to put the best features in our sets and get a 7 per cent market
share in the second year of our operation.
<p>Please organise a market research and send your recommendations within a period of three
month covering the north Indian markets.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management446
<p>The market research report says:
<p>1. TV manufacturers are coming out with latest innovations and they try to educate the buy-
ers about the same. Most of the time the customers are unaware of the benefi ts that the
innovations provide and may have a little reluctance about purchasing such products that
are diffi cult to use.
<p>2. The buyers commonly understand picture and sound quality.
3. Price, warranty and after-sales service play an important role in purchase decisions.
4. Psychological aspects such as looks, foreign collaboration and brand equity, too, have their
<p>value.
<p> Since the price of TV sets is quite high, TV purchase is a high-involvement purchase. Opinions
of other users, friends, neighbours, colleagues and sometimes TV dealers are sought. With some
20 brands to chose from and each brand having four&ndash;six models, the task of decision-making
is a rather onerous one.
The following features of colour TVs were tested on a scale of 1&ndash;5 in several areas in northern
India and the results obtained are:
<p>Feature Mean score Position
<p>Picture quality 5 1
Sound quality 5 2
After-sales service 4.9 3
Price 4.2 4
Brand equity 3.8 5
Appearance 3.3 6
Foreign collaboration 3 7
Picture in picture 3 8
Internet capable 3 9
Dealer&rsquo;s location 2.8 10
Friends recommendations 2.8 11
<p>As can be seen, the customers place a good deal of importance on picture and sound quality,
followed by after-sales service and price. Distinct features do play a role in purchase decisions,
but it seems that their relative importance is less due to the latent fear in the minds of buyers that
they may be paying a high price for features they may not be able to use due to their being too
hightech. Hence, the conclusion can be drawn that while new features will bring more business,
as they would certainly differentiate the products, a lot of concept selling, as also training in
usage would be required before the benefi ts can be cashed in on.
Advertising for creating and enhancing brand equity is a must, as brand plays a major decisive
role in purchase actions of the customers.
Areas like built-in stabilisers are not in consideration at all as most TVs have this feature.
In the same way, remote-control feature has become common and hence it ceases to be a
differentiating point.
Advertising, too, has become the done thing and at best, it is a negative factor. In other words,
less or no advertising would mean poor quality marketing efforts.
<p>Market research should be avoided, if enough time cannot be given for the research. Also, if the
budget does not permit a thorough enquiry or if information is not going to be suffi cient, market research
can be avoided. If the marketing people want to get the research done only for having their decisions
endorsed, it need not be undertaken.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 447
<p>On the contrary, the marketing people can get valuable inputs from market research like demand
forecasting, product specifi cations, advertising and promotion plan endorsement, locating new
markets, market segments, fi nalising distribution channels for optimising their effectiveness. Market
research can also help in making strategic plans for the fi rm.
<p>The market research process can be shown in a graphical form as given in Figure 17.3.
<p>Figure 17.3 Market Research Methodology
<p>For instance, if the management problem is of poor market image or low brand equity, market research
would fi nd out what is the exact brand equity of the fi rm with the target market segment. If the
management wants to know if the advertising budget is adequate or not, market research would try
to fi nd out the effectiveness of advertising. And if the marketing team wants to know the customers
of the product, the market research would fi nd out the target customers of the segment.
<p>If sales are stuck in recession, market research helps to fi nd out the price elasticity of the product
in the selected segment. For new product development, market research fi nds out if a new product
needs to be developed. If yes, with what specifi cations.
<p>DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS
<p>In data analysis, it is important to understand that based on application, the scale of measurement is
made. For instance, when you apply classifi cation of sex, geographic area or social class, when objects
are either identical or different, a nominal scale is used. If ranking or preferences or class standing are
the applications then objects could be smaller or larger. Here, rank order scale is used. For measurement
of altitude, temperature or between things where the intervals between adjoining ranks are equal, an
interval scale is used. For sales, income and the like, a ratio scale is used.
<p>ADVERTISING RESEARCH AND DAGMAR
<p>We have seen that in order to be focused on a fi rm&rsquo;s overall goals, the marketing department has
to play a vital role as the revenue earnings of the fi rms are mainly from selling of products. Hence,
once the fi rm&rsquo;s goals have been formulated the marketing and advertising people set their own goals
and objectives.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management448
<p>There is a relationship between advertising and marketing goals as the advertising efforts can
be measured. The full form of DAGMAR is: Defi ning Advertising Goals for Measured Advertising
Results.
<p>An example would make the theory simple to understand:
<p>There are 20 million scooter owners in India. Out of them, only 3 million accept that a four-stroke
scooter engine is more powerful and fuel effi cient. In two years time, through advertising, this
fi gure will be increased to 7 million.
<p>The simple job of advertising is to:
<p>1. Inform the customers about the fi rm&rsquo;s products.
2. Focus on the benefi ts the customers would derive from using the product, in order to motivate
<p>them into buying the same.
3. To ensure that the fi rm&rsquo;s customers stay true to the fi rm for repeat purchase. Advertising is
<p>done to remind customers.
<p>The objectives of advertising have been discussed earlier. With the changing business environment
and product life cycle shifts, the objectives keep moving, too. The DAGMAR theory needs constant
updating and vigilance to be of real value.
<p>Hence, DAGMAR becomes effective only when there is continuous advertising research conducted
as per a fi rm&rsquo;s requirement.
<p>ADVERTISING RESEARCH
<p>Advertising research is being extensively used by both advertisers and advertising agencies to pre-test
their campaign, evaluate the media&rsquo;s effectiveness and understand the market segment best suited
for the fi rm&rsquo;s products.
<p>Most fi rms arrange for market research for obtaining the market segment&rsquo;s viewpoints and pre-
ferences about products in their category. These researches tell about product acceptance levels,
brand awareness, top of the mind recall, as also modifi cations needed in products. A signifi cant part
of market research is advertising research, which concentrates on what type of advertising campaign
would be most suitable for the product, the ideal time for the product launch and limitations of the
product. Advertising research tries to correct any aberrations in the selected market segment for
the product.
<p>Advertising research tells the advertisers about the type of creativity and the type of language&mdash;
including slang and local dialect&mdash;would stimulate the target segment.
<p>Take the example of an advertisement about an air compressor. The advertisement talked about
ozone layer depletion and the need for having clean air. It also hinted at the specifi c design of the
compressor without talking about its usage. Technical managers seeing the advertisement thought
that it was some sort of air cleaner for homes, especially as it featured a pretty girl waving her hand.
After the research fi ndings became clear that the message of the advertisement was not clear, another
campaign was launched giving technical details with photographs of the compressor section by
section, which attracted the attention of technical people who asked for more information about
the product.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 449
<p>It will be diffi cult to fi nd an advertisement of a perfume, which gives its chemical formula.
Instead, perfume advertisements talk about love and feeling of euphoria created by the perfume.
Advertisements are the result of the research conducted which says that in personal care products,
people are interested in what it would do to them. It is said that nobody buys a product; they buy the
performance promised or given by the product.
<p>Advertising research results thus show the advertiser how to place correct advertisements at the
correct places and at the most appropriate time making them both effective and effi cient. How is the
research conducted? Let us understand in some detail:
<p>1. Testing research methods is done by having a preliminary research. It calls for a small sample
size and it only validates the reasons, objectives and creativity of the campaign.
<p>2. After the preliminary research, advertisers are interested in fi nding out the likes and dislikes of
the customers and the reasons for the same. Research is conducted by doing a primary survey
by interviewing customer groups. Such a research is similar to market research, as information
needed is akin to the one required in market research.
<p>3. Advertising research can also be conducted by observation. Researchers stand near shopping malls
and observe the shoppers, their likes and dislikes, their behaviour pattern. Such a researcher has
to objectively note down his observations without prejudice, otherwise the deductions would
be entirely lopsided. It may be useful to note that watching/observing customers in shops for
collecting data without their knowledge may not be purely ethical. Also, asking questions may
look like selling gimmicks rather then advertising or market research.
<p>To fi nd out why people stay in a particular hotel the research would ask questions as follows:
<p>1. Do you stay here for its location, its food or its ambience?
2. Do you stay for the health club and conference facility?
3. Do you stay here because it comes within your budget?
4. Do you fi nd service a favourable factor here?
5. Is the staff cordial enough?
6. Have the hotel helped you in any crisis situation?
7. Does the hotel provide extra care and benefi ts to regular customers?
8. How is communication system of the hotel?
9. Does the room service give prompt service and does it have a good range of dishes?
<p>The next type of research can be termed as idea research where an attempt is made to understand how
some changes in an advertising campaign would affect the result as far as the advertising objectives
are concerned. For example, would increase in advertising size improve its acceptance or would a
change in its frequency improve top of the mind recall?
<p>Methodology
<p>Defi ne the research objective, list out the problems for which answers have to be found: Has the market
acceptance increased for the new Maruti 800 car? Does the new detergent help in catching the mood of
the housewife better with its non-caustic chemical formula, which is easy on the hands? While framing </p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management450
<p>the questions, it is advisable to make them short and unambiguous, to ensure the right response. For
getting response on relative likes and dislikes, it is correct to give just fi ve options:
<p>1. Like the product greatly, will surely buy it.
2. Like it and may buy it.
3. The product is just like others, may or may not buy it.
4. Do not like it and it is unlikely that I will buy it.
5. The product is bad and I will never buy it.
<p>Secondary research data is available from a variety of sources, including the fi rm&rsquo;s own records,
trade publications, government publications and from research fi rms like ORG Marg. Secondary data
is valuable information and its analysis can give the right direction for marketing and advertising.
First, it takes less time and effort. Plus it could prove if it is not outdated.
<p>Finding the Right Sample Size
<p>Imagine sending teams to contact the entire population. Even a single metropolitan city like Delhi
has a population of 1.4 million. It would be an exercise in futility because by the time the research
report comes out, the problem or the situation that triggered the research would have disappeared.
Hence, only a carefully chosen sample is used for getting the data. The sample selection is done on
the following lines:
<p>1. Probability sample: Here each person from the population (also known as the universe) has
known opportunity of being part of the sample, though not necessarily an equal chance.
<p>2. Simple random sample: This is also a probability sample except it is where each member has an
equal opportunity of being included. If there are 35,000 lady motorists in Delhi and you want
to have a sample of 350, pick up every 100th lady motorist.
<p>3. Stratifi ed random sample: This would require to further sub-divide the lady motorist into age
groups&mdash;18&ndash;25, 26&ndash;40, 41&ndash;60 and above 60. Then you choose an equal number from each age
group as your sample.
<p>4. Cluster sample: Segregating the universe geographically could make cluster sample. Equal
number of lady motorists from north, south, east, west and central Delhi would make the cluster
sample.
<p>5. Non-probability sample: This is where each sub-category is given a specifi c equal number.
Hundred graduates and 100 postgraduates would comprise the quota sample, as it is called.
<p>6. Judgement sample: This is when you decide the sample members on the basis of their value
to the research.
<p>7. Convenience sample: This is when you go to the people who you fi nd convenient to contact.
<p>The non-probability sample leaves a margin of doubt whether the sample is truly representative
of the universe. Selecting a sample by itself is important, as it helps in understanding the results of
the research better. Research does not provide results or facts, it only gives tendencies. Sample size
determines the accuracy levels. At times it is important to sacrifi ce accuracy for speed and budget.
<p>Advertising research can be carried out before the launch of the advertising campaign. It helps in
media planning and copy testing along with test marketing the product to be advertised. Advertising </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Research 451
<p>research carried out during the campaign focuses on dealer audit, sales analysis and customer&rsquo;s response
based on contests or reply cut-outs given with the advertisements for customers to fi ll in their comments
and send back to the advertiser.
<p>After the campaign is over, as per DAGMAR, research is done to assess the effectiveness of the campaign
on the parameter of the objectives of the advertising campaign. At this time, consumer panel surveys
are conducted for structured responses. Consumer panels are predetermined group of people, mostly
of one geographic and demographic segment like lady members of a kitty party. These persons are
in the know of their task of making assessments of the campaigns and inform the advertiser about
their views.
<p>Selecting research sample needs knowledge of the market, the universe and quantitative techniques.
Gathering information or data collection can be done by in-depth interviews where the respondent
(one member of the sample chosen), is asked questions from a well-structured questionnaire. The
respondent can give his own views. A lot of time is given for each question. The interviewer must be
adept at organising such interviews and later on in making a coherent and lucid report.
<p>When the interview is conducted in a well-accepted and known group called the focus group,
the same type of in-depth incisive questions can be asked. The problem, which can arise, is confl ict
within a group that has diverse views. The questions can be of two types: simple straightforward
types where the answer can be yes or no. However, when it is important to understand the mindset
of the respondent, it is better to use projective questions, which can be vague and which would evoke
emotional, sentimental and creative answers.
<p> What product do you associate with Hrithik Roshan?
When you think of colour, who do you think of?
Sixty years young, climbing the staircase?
Just do it. Which product do you associate with this statement?
<p>These are just a few samples. Some more are:
<p>How do you rate the following hotels in Delhi:
<p>1. Maurya Sheraton
2. Taj Mansingh
3. The Oberoi
4. Hyatt Regency
5. Taj Palace
<p>The way I look is important to me:
<p>1. Strongly agree
2. Agree
3. Neutral

<p>Surveys, observations and experiments with the help of questionnaires, checklists and plans
help in completing the advertising surveys. Then comes the important aspect of analysis and report
writing.</p>

<p>Research, as stated earlier, must be used or else the time and money spent on it is a total waste. Re-
search results enable fi rms in reassessing their goals on the basis of new opportunities, in confi rming
the target segment and creating a useful message for the segment. Advertising results can be measured
by simple brand recall tests with the target segment. These can be aided or unaided recalls.
<p>Which is the best toothpaste in the market?
Which blue and red bottled drink gives most satisfaction?
<p>Research confi rms the strong views held by fi rms. If there is a major divergence, then a re-look is
required at the objectives, sample and methods adopted in the research. Next, a very apt example of
how research could go wrong is given.
<p>A fi rm planned to start the manufacture of fax machines in India in the 1980s. The task of fi nding
out the demand and product acceptance levels was given to an outside research agency by the
fi rm. The result was fl attering inasmuch that 80 per cent of the respondents were looking forward
to buying a fax machine. When the note was sent to the Department of Telecommunications,
Government of India, it came back saying that the telecom network was not effi cient enough
to make fax a success. (It was only in the late 1980s that digital electronic exchanges, fi bre optic
cables made the telecom network good enough for faxes to operate.)
<p>The research should make you aware of the consumer&rsquo;s behaviour towards competitive products.
Advertising research is a part of marketing research, confi ned to development of advertising
<p>plan, creative work, market segment and the best possible media, which would cater to the segment.
The research should increase the effectiveness and effi ciency of the advertising campaign. Data col-
lection is done from primary sources as also secondary, already available sources. In primary data
collection, it is important to select the sample correctly. The research steps are:
<p>1. Setting up the goals for the research.
2. Finding the sources of secondary information/data.
3. Analysing secondary data.
4. Planning sample for primary research.
5. Data collection.
6. Data analysis and report writing.
<p>The advertising campaign is pre-tested and post-tested to ensure that it works.
<p>Guidelines for Making a Questionnaire
<p>1. Ask basic questions about respondent&rsquo;s name and address. While asking his age and
income, give a range like age between: 18&ndash;30/31&ndash;45/46&ndash;60/61 and above. Income between
Rs: 3,000&ndash;7,000/8,000&ndash;15,000/16,000&ndash;30,000.
<p>2. Questions with two possible answers: Did you buy the watch yourself, yes or no?
3. Multiple choice questions: Who advised you to buy the watch, your father, uncle, sister
<p>or cousin?
4. Likert scale questions: The watch is considered best value for money. Tick the answer you
<p>consider right: (a) strongly disagree; (b) disagree; (c) neutral; (d) agree; (e) strongly agree.

<p>5. Differential scale: The hotel is: large/small; modern/outmoded.
<p> The hotel staff is experienced/inexperienced; courteous/disinterested.
<p>Questions on importance of the product can be put on a scale of extremely important, very

<p>18 Distribution of Goods Worldwide
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Once a fi rm has completed its marketing research and decided about the product(s) it wants to
introduce in the market, having selected the niche market, the fi rm needs to ensure that its customers
and prospective customers are aware of the product and its use, and the product is available to them
at convenient shops. The fi rst objective of communicating with customers is done through personal
selling and advertising. The second is done through organising a proper distribution system. In this
chapter, the distribution methods available to fi rms are discussed. Students will learn about the dif-
ferent methods of distribution and the process of selecting the most appropriate one for the selected
countries. The fi rms can choose the method best suited to their needs taking the product and its
service requirements into account.</p>

<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 455
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>For manufacturers there are two basic distribution systems. The first one is as shown in
Figure 18.1.
<p>Figure 18.1 Simple Distribution System
<p>In this method, the manufacturer sells by personal selling, through direct mail or from the fi rm&rsquo;s
own shops (Bata, for instance, sells its shoes through its own shops). In the second method, there can
be a number of intermediaries as shown in Figure 18.2.
<p>
<p>Figure 18.2 Next Stage Distribution System
<p>In the indirect method, the simple method starts from manufacturers who sell the product to
wholesaler, who in turn sell it to retailer for sale to the ultimate customer. At each step, some amount
of money is given as profi t which adds to the selling price of the product to the customer. In most
cases, the manufacturer follows the set pattern of product distribution as per trade practices or how
the competitors are distributing their products. However, blindly following competition is not the ans-
wer, as competitors may be having different scales of production or any other basic difference with
the fi rm. Innovations in distribution methods are taking place and fi rms should take advantage of the
new methods.
<p>Let us examine the two broad categories of products and their presently accepted distribution
patterns.
<p>Industrial Goods
<p>Figure 18.3 shows the distribution patterns for industrial goods.
<p>Figure 18.3 Industrial Product Distribution System</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management456
<p>As can be seen, in industrial goods, the sale is made either directly to the customer or through a
distributor. The sale of capital goods is usually made directly to the customer because of the following
reasons:
<p>1. Technicalities have to be explained to the customer, which are best done by the manufacturer.
2. Mostly large sums of money are involved and the customer wants the best price without having
<p>to pay for the middleman&rsquo;s commission.
3. Installation and commissioning of the equipment is involved, which is best done by the
<p>manufacturer&rsquo;s engineers.
4. After-sales service is complicated.
<p>In the case of the sale of raw materials and components, the manufacturers sell through a distributor
network the size of which is fi nalised taking into consideration the geographic area that needs to be
covered by the manufacturer.
<p>Consumer Goods
<p>These are usually sold through the distribution channels as shown in Figure 18.4.
<p>Figure 18.4 Consumer Goods Distribution Channels
<p>Very small fi rms, who have a limited market, like bakeries, may resort to direct selling to their cus-
tomers. Very large fi rms have sole distributors with their own network of dealers and retailers. We
will discuss the merits and demerits of each of the methods of distribution and some other methods
as well.
<p>Other distribution methods include the following:
<p>1. Own shops
2. Franchise outlets
3. Mail order
4. Catalogue sales
5. Web marketing
6. Agency operations
7. Stockists
8. Consignment agents</p>

<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 457
<p>Own Shops
<p>Many manufacturers like Bata, Usha and Singer have their own, that is, company-owned sales outlets
(shops). These shops ensure that the products are available to the customer in a good quantity, of the
right quality and at the right price. Besides, as the shops only keep the products of the fi rm, control on
sales can be more effective as compared to the sales made through dealers and retailers, who handle
competitive products as well. The fi rms mentioned earlier realised the great asset they had in their
own shops and as the fi rms had only a limited range of products, the shops, situated mostly in prime
locations, were not being fully utilised. These fi rms, therefore, added complementary products and
made their shops as sales outlets for the complete range of products in their particular fi elds.
<p>Franchise Outlets
<p>Manufacturers often give legal rights to an independent business entity to run the franchiser&rsquo;s
business (under some controls by the franchiser, like quality control). The franchisees help the manu-
facturers to add to their business, have bigger geographic coverage and increase their market share.
MacDonald&rsquo;s and Pizza Hut are two examples of manufacturers who have used the franchise sys-
tem effectively.
<p>Mail Order
<p>Some products like Reader&rsquo;s Digest magazine are sold through mail order. Customers are requested to
send their orders directly to the publishers, who send the product directly to the customers.
<p>Catalogue Sales
<p>These are a variant of mail order. In this case fi rms dealing with a number of products get colourful
and attractive catalogues made describing the products. These catalogues are then sold or distributed
to a large number of prospective customers, who select products from the catalogue and place order
with the fi rm. The fi rms have to ensure that the quality of the product sold is the same as mentioned
in the catalogue; otherwise, the negative publicity generated by selling products of an inferior quality
will spoil the reputation of their business.
<p>Web Marketing
<p>The spread of computers and internet has opened the doors for marketing or selling on the internet.
A number of advertisements can be seen on every website. The customers can place orders on the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management458
<p>internet itself and make their purchase using credit cards. The sellers will surely dispatch the product
against the order. Since there are no expenses on having to maintain shops, an effective reduction in
prices can be made. The only danger of these types of sales is that the customer does not get to see
the product before they receive them.
<p>Agency Operations
<p>Agents are independent businessmen who help manufacturers in selling their products. The agents
obtain orders from customers, which they forward to the manufacturers. On the conclusion of the
transaction, the agent gets an agency commission for his efforts in getting the orders. Agents can be
both for buying and selling products. They have long-term agreements with manufacturers and they
operate within the terms and conditions of the contract. Their task includes negotiating the sales
contract with the buyers on behalf of the manufacturers for which they have the authority. They
build long-term relationships with the buyers who benefi t as they get consistently good products
at uniform prices.
<p>Stockists
<p>Manufacturers sometimes appoint stockists who are businessmen with storage space. The stockist&rsquo;s
job is to keep stocks on behalf of the manufacturer and dispatch the same to distributors and retailers
on receiving instructions from the manufacturer. They get a commission from the manufacturers for
the use of their storage space and their efforts in making dispatches. Normally, they are not involved
in the actual selling effort of the fi rm.
<p>Consignment Agents
<p>These businessmen are required to keep stocks of the manufacturer&rsquo;s merchandise on their behalf and
as and when they are able to sell the products they send the money received to the manufacturer. For
their efforts they are paid a commission on sales. These types of agents are especially needed when a
product is introduced in the market and the channel members are not sure of its saleability.
<p>Unlike in the fi rst half of the twentieth century, when the manufacturer decided the channel as
per his convenience, now the channel selection depends mainly on the market survey report, which
tells the manufacturer, how the customer wants to buy the product. The main criteria can be summed
up as follows:
<p>1. Customer reach for the channel.
2. Customer convenience of buying.
3. Service facility needed by the product and its availability with the channel.
4. Number of products available from one manufacturer for the channel.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 459
<p>Customer Reach
<p>Sales orientation in the fi rst half of the twentieth century was mainly on manufacture. Once the
product was in the market, it was sold. Competition was almost absent for most products. Some
products enjoyed total monopoly and the manufacturer could set his terms of sale. For a majority
of products, however, there were a few manufacturers. In other words, there was oligopoly and the
manufacturers could join hands and control market prices. Later on, in order to avoid the situation
of cartel formation, the Government of India set up the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices
Commission (MRTPC).
<p>Today, in the beginning of the twenty-fi rst century, manufacturers are facing severe competition
in practically all products and the manufacturer who can place his product within easy reach of the
buyer defi nitely gains advantage over other competitors.
<p>Taking this view, Eureka Forbes has started personalised selling of its products, which include
consumer durables like vacuum cleaners and water purifi ers. The sales are made by the fi rm&rsquo;s sales-
persons visiting the homes and offi ces of prospective customers with samples of the product. They
give live demonstration to convince the customers and obtain an order.
<p>Many retailers have resorted to home delivery systems, including for consumer durables. The
customer can buy a product by placing an order over the phone or on the internet and the product is
delivered to his home. Such purchases are paid for either by cash or through credit cards.
<p>Customer Convenience Buying
<p>In every residential locality, convenience stores or retail outlets have come up. These shops keep
stocks of a variety of products of daily needs, which the residents buy. As the shops keep competitive
products they sell the products as per the following plan:
<p>1. Brand as per customers demand.
2. Brand on the basis of sales commission they get from the fi rm. If the customer has no particular
<p>choice the shopkeeper will try to sell such a product where he gets maximum profi t.
3. In case the shop does not have the brand the customer demands, the shopkeeper will try to
<p>convince the customer to buy the brand in stock.
<p>No manufacturer can afford to avoid retail shops, which cover the convenience criteria for the
customers.
<p>Sales with Service
<p>Several consumer durable products require service to be provided to the product on either a periodic
basis, as is required for automobiles, or once in a while, as is required for air conditioners. Retailers
who can provide such service should sell all such products, which need regular service. Maruti car
dealers are selected only on the condition that they can provide proper service for the cars sold. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management460
<p>In fact, Maruti provides technical training to the engineers of their dealers. The dealers have to maintain
stocks of spare parts and accessories, which enables them to provide timely service.
<p>Multiple Product Manufacturers
When one manufacturer can supply a variety of products needed by one type of customer, Hindustan
Unilever being a good example, then they need to have distributors who can invest in inventories and
prime locations for their retail sales outlets.
<p>We will now discuss the value of wholesalers in the distribution system. Manufacturers need re-
tailers most, as they are the link between the manufacturer and the consumer. However, manufacturers
fi nd it diffi cult to sell to retailers directly, as they need a small quantity of the products only. Selling to
numerous retailers would involve huge amounts of billing activity and several dispatches to a variety
of locations needing enormous manpower. Wholesalers buy in bulk and hence selling to wholesalers
reduces these activities. Bulk packing can be used for large consignments. Wholesalers, also called
distributors, perform the following functions for the manufacturer:
<p>1. Buy in bulk.
2. Making &lsquo;small customer size&rsquo; packages.
3. Buying a variety of products and making matched sets as required by the customers like soap
<p>and soap dish, toothpaste and toothbrush.
4. Stocking products in large quantities ensuring that the dealer is never out of stock without
<p>having to invest in a large inventory himself.
5. Low cost transport to retailers can be provided as for a small quantity they need not hire trucks.
<p>They can use tempos, three wheelers and hand trolleys.
6. Provide information regarding activities of the competition, new products in the market and
<p>change in prices of products. They can virtually be the market surveyors for the fi rm.
7. Provide credit, loans and leasing facilities (either themselves or through a leasing agency) to
<p>the customers.
8. Share in the advertising and promotion arranged by the fi rm.
<p>As many fi rms resort to direct selling to the retail trade and sometimes to the customers, wholesalers
may become obsolete in the future. Wholesalers have been performing important tasks in the busi-
ness of the manufacturers, the most important being that of making bulk purchases. It is for this
reason that the wholesalers prefer to sell products of only one manufacturer. They may take up the
sale of another manufacturer if there is no competition involved. Furthermore, wholesalers take up
products from other manufacturers if they complement their main product either as an accessory or
an original component. The exclusivity of product sale is legally not appropriate under the MRTPC
Act. Most fi rms, however, keep the exclusivity clause in the agreement as unwritten.
<p>In order to survive in the distribution race, wholesalers/distributors, have started to re-focus their
strategies as follows:
<p>1. Distributors/wholesalers divest themselves of small jobs and concentrate on the distribution
as their main line of business. It provides the required focus to the task of distribution.
<p>2. Distributors/wholesalers take up product servicing as per standards laid by the manufacturers.
They invest in service equipments, service consumables and stock of spares required for
providing quality service to the customers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 461
<p>3. Distributors/wholesalers take up other customer-oriented activities like providing leasing
options to the customers, through their retailers.
<p>4. Distributors/wholesalers get their people trained in servicing of products and in sales tech-
niques. They impart this training to the sales and service people of the retailers to enhance value
addition to the products.
<p>5. Distributors/wholesalers help the manufacturers in meeting their sales targets.
<p>RETAIL BUSINESS
<p>The retail business really came of age in the last decade of the twentieth century. Retail shops have
grown from being mere storage depots in the fi rst half of the twentieth century to supermarket
chains. Historically, retailing started as sales by pushcarts, carrying products of daily use. The cart
puller was also the salesman who vended the products in residential areas. In the morning, the
housewife found the bread and butter seller at her doorstep. These salesmen hired or purchased shops
with the earnings that they saved, in the same localities where they vended their wares. While they
lost on mobility, they gained in larger product range and bigger clientele. Some shops became almost
like morning clubs where friends would meet for making purchases and exchange gossip and news.
Despite the entry of supermarket chains, these shops have survived as they do provide a service to
the local customers. In fact, even handcarts have remained as retail links. A large variety of products,
such as vegetables, are still sold by people using pushcarts.
<p>At present retail has not lost its importance in the least. In fact, there have been maximum
innovations in the retail business as discussed next:
<p>1. Supermarkets&mdash;The one-stop shops: These shops are really multiple shops in one with a large
variety of products, sometimes complementary and sometimes totally dissimilar in nature and use. The
common factor in all shops remains the type of customer who visits the shops. Nowadays, shoe shops
sell sportswear, woollens and leather garments in addition to shoes. Gasoline stations have general
merchandise shops from where patrons who come to fi ll their cars with fuel can also purchase gift
items, food products and novelties to name a few products. Service centres have restaurants where
people coming to get their car serviced can spend their time having a meal or snacks. Big departmental
stores too have small eating areas and toilets for the shoppers. Some have also added children
centres where children can have a good time while their parents shop.
<p>2. Discount stores: These are coming up for several manufacturers. Products, which have some
small defect, are sold at a discount at these shops. Manufacturers use these stores to fi ght
competition. While heavy discounts can be offered on practically good products, no price war
can be started on this basis.
<p>3. Boutiques: These have sprung up in most cities to cater to the elite of the town. These shops keep
the latest fashion garments and other accessories. The products are expensive as the customers
are not price conscious. These customers are looking for unique things as status symbols.
<p>4. Superstore chains: Superstore chains have come up to provide the same range of products, at the
same prices and using similar selling techniques in different cities. Normally, the customer has
one such store near his house and he does not have to travel long distance to his supermarket for
shopping. Marks &amp; Spencer&rsquo;s, C&amp;A in the UK are such chains. Now Delhi, too, has its own Marks
&amp; Spencer shop. With large volume business, they offer competitive prices to the customers. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management462
<p>The small shopkeeper with low volumes fi nds it diffi cult to compete with these giants. These
chain stores dictate their terms to manufacturers as they hold large volume business. They, at
times, get the manufacturers to supply the product with the chain&rsquo;s brand name rather than
selling the product under the manufacturer&rsquo;s brand name.
<p>5. Shopless shops: These sell products to customers through television shops, computer ad-
vertising and telephone marketing. Television has time slots during which products are shown
and their use is demonstrated. The customer is then requested to place his order on telephone
for the delivery of the product and the customer makes his payment upon delivery. The internet
too is used to give product demonstrations and orders are solicited through the internet and
payments are made via credit cards. Telephone calls are used by telemarketers, who give their
sales pitch on the telephone to carefully selected, likely customers. These calls are followed
by visit of salesman to procure the order on the basis of telephone calls, which, to an extent,
conveniences the customer into buying the products. With low overheads, these sellers can
offer low prices and one wonders if the days of supermarkets are numbered.
<p>6. Retailers are now using the latest electronic products like computers for billing, inventory con-
trol, building customer database and electronic anti-theft and surveillance devices. Bank
retailing has gone to the extent of salesman-less sales through automatic teller machines&mdash;the
ubiquitous ATMs.
<p>7. Manufacturers&rsquo; own shops: Thus retail system has been tried by several manufacturers in India, like
Usha, Bata and Singer. These shops have the advantage of providing genuine products at company
prices. Customers can get the entire range of products&mdash;the full variety. However, if the manu-
facturer&rsquo;s range of product is not large enough, the shop will not be a success as the customers
visit shops for a range of products where they get to see the full variety. A manufacturer of only
toothpaste, handkerchief or boot polish cannot sustain a shop meant just for a single product.
It is for this reason only that Usha, Bata and Singer have all started selling a complete range
of products even on a buy&ndash;sell basis. Shops diversify their product range by adding similar
products or products which go as accessories with their main products to take the synergic
benefi t of add-on products.
<p> It can be seen that each type of distribution method has some advantages and some dis-
advantages. Depending on the product range, product market segment, the products stage in the
product life cycle (PLC) and the capacity of the manufacturer to produce, the channel is selected.
<p>1. Sole distributor: They work on volumes of business with low margins of profi t. Their
market penetration is low as they depend on their retailers. With a large operational area,
they tend to lose grip on the market.
<p>2. Area distributor: They cover a certain geographic area and sell through dealers and
retailers operating in their area. Usually area distributors work for one manufacturer only.
At least they do not deal in competing products. Area distributors tend to sell in the area
of neighbouring distributors encroaching on the geographic boundaries fi xed and this
creates problems in terms of &lsquo;sales commission&rsquo; that is given only to one distributor.
<p>3. Non-exclusive distributors: They deal in products of a number of manufacturers but they
avoid having competing products.
<p>4. Stockists: They keep the manufacturer&rsquo;s stocks for giving to the dealers or retailers against
authority from the manufacturer. For this purpose they are paid a commission. Stockists
help the manufacturers in faster supplies of products to retailers, as they are located near
the markets, while manufacturing units could be quite far off.
<p>5. Consignment sale stockists: They sell the product to the retailers after receiving the goods
from the manufacturers without paying for the goods. Once they sell the goods they send
the payment to the manufacturers.</p>
<br>

<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 463
<p>To sum up, the distribution method choices are as follows:

2. Sole distributor &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Retailer ..&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;B

<p>We will now attempt to give weight to each of these distribution methods on the following
basis:
<p>1. Coverage of the designated area.
2. Concentration possible in the area.
3. Control of the manufacturer on the method.
4. Cost to the manufacturer.
<p>Table 18.1 gives some idea of these factors, although they may vary from product to product and
area to area.
<p>Table 18.1 Analysing Distribution Channels
<p>Distribution Coverage Concentration Control Cost
<p>A Wide High Low High
B Medium Medium Low Medium
C Medium Low Low Medium
D Medium Medium Medium Medium
E Wide Low Medium Medium
F Wide Medium Low Low
G Medium Low Low Low
H Low High Low Low
I Medium Medium Low Low
J Low High Top class Medium
<p>Note: The alphabets A&ndash;J in column 1 denote the distribution method choices mentioned
earlier.
<p>These values keep on changing and marketers have to understand the market dynamics before
fi nalising their distribution method.
<p>In several product groups and markets, with the help of direct selling catalogue and internet
sales, the middlemen as these intermediaries are called, have been eliminated. They are regarded by
a section of society and business community to be only moneymaking bodies that do not perform
any worthwhile task. The distribution chain adds to the costs of sale, which, ultimately the customer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management464
<p>has to bear. As most middlemen do not perform any value addition function, these could be reduced
if not totally eliminated.
<p>However, it must be understood that to remain in a competitive market, the middlemen have learnt
to provide value added services to the customers like leasing, hire purchase options and product
servicing. Thus, they give the manufacturer the chance of concentrating on production, product de-
velopment and innovation, advertising and sales promotion.
<p>It is therefore important for each manufacturer to weigh each of his concerns and then opt for a
particular method of reaching his product to the people for whom they are meant and are produced
in the fi rst place, the customers.
<p>Manufacturers like Eureka Forbes have eliminated the middlemen altogether, while others with
similar product ranges are still using the time-tested methods. Personal selling like what is done by
Eureka Forbes helps in building relationships, but it calls for huge investments in manpower, their
training and area coverage.
<p>LEASING AND HIRE PURCHASE
<p>The twenty-fi rst century has seen a great revolution in television and information technology in
India. This has led to much greater awareness of consumer products among people. They think of
buying high-cost products, which they may not be able to afford. Consumerism, keeping up with
the neighbours is the trend today. Manufacturers and sellers both not only encourage the trend as it
helps them sell more, they also facilitate the buyers by giving them deferred payment options. For
fi nancing purchase by customers, the sellers are taking the help of fi nance leasing fi rms. Now buyers
can buy cars, houses and other luxuries without having ready cash for the purchase. They can get the
money from the leasing fi rms, on interest. The advantages of lease purchase are:
<p>1. As no money is to be paid, or only a token amount is to be paid, the buyer tends to buy more.
Many times he buys things that he really does not want.
<p>2. The buyer buys more than he needs.
3. The buyer can possess items much beyond his capacity to purchase and feel good.
4. The buyer can make payments for the purchase as per his capacity to pay on a monthly basis.
5. Products with low brand awareness get sold.
<p>The disadvantages of lease purchase are:
<p>1. Buyer buys products he does not want/cannot afford.
2. Monthly payments can become a big dent in the buyer&rsquo;s pocket.
3. Sellers may sell to a buyer who does not have the money to pay or may not have intentions of
<p>making the payments. In such a case, the seller has to run after the buyer and he may have to
resort to legal action to claim the amount, which is not good for the business of the seller.
<p>As in the West, especially in America, leasing and hire purchase have become a norm, it is expected
to take further roots in India also.
<p>Firms that have selected to carry out sales through channels rather than through their own
salespersons face the following situations:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Distribution of Goods Worldwide 465
<p>1. Dealer/distributor should sell their products exclusively. In such an event the dealers are not
allowed to sell competitive products. These dealers therefore expect the seller to be also totally
loyal to them and not sell their products through any other dealer or channel. The dealer expects
the seller to remain competitive in the market and for this purpose he wants matching prices,
discounts and other terms of business as compared to what the competitors are offering to
their dealers. The seller has to remain vigilant in such situations as usually the dealer tries to
exaggerate the terms of competition for the better, which may not always be true. Seller needs
to verify these statements from independent sources too.
<p>2. Exclusive areas dealers want the sellers to offer the products only to them in their designated
area. The dealer also gets bound to sell the products in his area only. In case the seller fi nds
the dealer is not selling as per his expectations, he has to either cancel the dealership as per the
agreed terms or consider appointing another person to sell in the same area. To avoid any confl ict,
the dealership agreement should have a clause that allows the seller to appoint more dealers.
<p>3. Many sellers try to sell their slow moving products together with their fast moving ones. This
is called product bundling. They sell the package deal or bundled products (a popular name
for computer software combinations). The dealers can object to such deals.
<p> The MRTPC Act as it is popularly known, forbids the sellers to have such agreements and
dealers can take recourse against any such practice by writing to the MRTPC. However, in
practice, most such deals are done with the full cooperation of the dealers and dealer agreements
have only an unwritten clause for such activities.
<p> We can summarise the activities of distributors/wholesalers as follows:
<p>1. Give large volume business to the manufacturers; operate through dealers and retailers to
cover the geographic area assigned to them. Sell a small number of items only. Sell to the
second level of the distribution chain&mdash;the dealer or the retailer as also to bulk industrial
buyers.
<p>2. Purchase goods for resale from manufacturers in India or through imports.
3. Some have their own retail outlets also.
4. They have technical knowledge required to sell the product. Can provide product service
<p>to the customers.
5. Make profi ts on large turnover even with low margins.
<p> Similarly, the activities of retailers can be summed up:
<p>1. Sell a large variety of multi-brand products.
2. Sell in low volumes for each product as compared to the distributor of the product, who
<p>handles a large number of retailers.
3. Sell to customers/consumers.
4. Purchase goods from wholesalers.
5. Location of retail shop, its fa&ccedil;ade, inner displays, window displays, salespersons and
<p>shop ambience are extremely important for the success of the shop.
6. Profi t margins for each product are higher than those of the distributor.
7. Product mix, product shelf life are major considerations.
<p>With internet marketing, telemarketing and teleshopping networks, which sell through television,
the established channel of distribution may be threatened in the near future.</p>

and Exports
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
When a fi rm enters the market, it has some commitments to its customers, which are based on the
utility, need and performance of its product. With a shrinking business world, even political distances
can be shortened as no nation can remain an island. Therefore, in order to not just survive, but also to
thrive in the marketplace, fi rms must have a global vision of the market, even if it is selling only locally,
as otherwise foreign fi rms are going to cut into their business sharply. Hence, the nature of commitment
of fi rms has to widen to not just cope with international competition but also in order to beat them in
their own countries as well. In this chapter, students will learn about the nature of international markets
and the role of market information in gaining competitive advantage in the international markets.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management468
<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
<p>The steps to counter competition are the following:
<p>1. In-depth or intensive marketing within the country.
2. Extension of geographic boundaries of the markets.
3. Penetrating pricing strategy.
4. Strong merchandising effort.
5. Advertising, promotion strategy.
6. New product plans.
7. New products to be sold in new markets.
8. Vertical integration of manufacturing base.
<p>Intensive Marketing
<p>Depending on product surpluses, fi rms have to take a view that would encourage them into going
in for aggressive selling to their present customers. Gillette is a case in point. When they started with
their use-and-throw Presto razors, they were giving individual razors. Later on they came out with
a pack of fi ve razors, taking away the customers choice of product-switch midstream. Built-in gift
schemes, leasing options, deferred payment plans all tend to intensify the thrust of marketing on
the customer.
<p>Geographic Extensions
<p>Customers in India are now much more discerning about the quality of product they purchase and
hence products from India today match international standards. It is therefore in the fi tness of busi-
ness that if Indian fi rms face competition from foreign fi rms they must fi nd countries where they have
a competitive advantage because of low-cost manpower and the latest technology products.
<p>Penetrating Pricing
<p>Indian products have a built-in cost advantage over their foreign counterparts. Yet, in the export
market, the competition is from other developing countries. Products can be sold on marginal costing,
provided there is a good base of sales in India.
<p>Merchandising
<p>Merchandising is the icing on the cake, the showmanship of products. In order to cater to the sophis-
ticated customers, fi rms must pay great attention to the merchandising aspect of retailing.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 469
<p>Advertising and Promotion Strategy
<p>Advertising and promotion are the buzzwords in today&rsquo;s business and need special thrust on a
continuous basis.
<p>New Product Plan
<p>New products come from either customer needs or new product development and technology
innovation.
<p>Marketing Research
<p>Marketing research is essential for scanning world markets for new products and these researches
pay dividends by optimising marketing efforts in the right countries and through the right channels
of distribution.
<p>Vertical Integration of Manufacturing Base
<p>Vertical diversifi cation helps in reducing transfer costs as then the fi rm gets its raw materials from
its own source. Well-established fi rms fi nd themselves becoming top-heavy over a period of time,
especially in the growth stages of its life cycle. Downsizing, or right sizing as it is called today, is the
order of the day for such fi rms. The steps required for right sizing are:
<p>1. A quick audit of the fi rm&rsquo;s activities to segregate the superfl uous ones. Fixing an objective of
right sizing exercise.
<p>2. Closure of all superfl uous activities (those activities, which do not generate any value for the
customers).
<p>3. Outsourcing activities to outside persons/fi rms.
4. Reducing manpower across the board, in every department at all levels.
5. Giving more important assignments and better pay to the remaining people.
6. Consolidating the gains of reduced activities.
7. Benchmarking results with the objective with which the fi rm had started the task.
8. If the right sizing does not succeed, it may be a good idea to divest from the product areas
<p>completely.
<p>Firms have realised that they cannot operate in isolation. Coordination between two fi rms can
help both in some way even when they may be competing with each other as can be seen from the
following examples:
<p>1. A cash-rich fi rm joins hands with a technology-rich fi rm. Both gain in terms of market share
and profi ts.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management470
<p>2. Promotion plans can be jointly worked out. The industry bodies do it regularly when they fi ght
against any government legislation.
<p>3. Logistics support can be provided, which will reduce the costs substantially for both fi rms. If
two neighbouring fi rms can use one common road, power and telephone lines, it could mean
a lot of savings for both.
<p>4. Price collaborations are popular in the hospitality industry like hotels and airlines. All of them
provide similar benefi ts to customers like upgrades, free tickets for fl ying frequently with a
particular airlines or free stay for frequent use of a particular hotel.
<p>Because of the fast-changing market scenario and business environment, it is best to take the
following steps for creating strategies for markets (see Figure 19.1).
<p>Figure 19.1 Marketing Strategy Creation with Feedback Loop
<p>As the fi rm goes into the implementation stage, it should not forget that even then changes are
taking place in the market environments. Feedback therefore becomes a powerful tool of ensuring
satisfactory management of marketing strategies.
<p>MARKET ANALYSIS
<p>It starts with Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force Model and goes on to understand the general environment
factors (as discussed earlier). However, continuous monitoring of the environment is essential as the
competition keeps growing each day.
<p>PLANNING THE STRATEGY
<p>This starts with allocation of resources&mdash;money, manpower, information and infrastructure&mdash;in
the right area of marketing. It must decided how much of the budget will be spent on advertising,
after-sales service, marketing research, developing new areas, travelling, dealer commission and
promotional plans in view of the sales targets fi nalised by the marketing department. Each sales
team needs certain inputs like travelling, communications and live demonstrations (if required by
the product), to meet its commitment on sales objectives and these must be provided. New business
horizons, like new geographic coverage and new product launches call for separate budgets. Care
needs to be taken in manpower planning and deployment to ensure that the people working together
work as a team, are congruent in operations, complement each other and are well balanced both in
numbers and in experience. Market information system (MIS) should be kept updated with inputs
from the market, sales invoices and dispatches. Authority to take decisions, along with accountability
must be expressed perhaps in writing so that each member of the team knows his tasks, what he can
do and what he cannot. Importance of scientifi c planning for the market has been brought to focus
by the myriads of non-achievers who start with a bang and end with a whimper in no time.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 471
<p>Since competing fi rms have similar goals and objectives, fi rm that implements this strategy wins
with better profi ts and improved brand equity.
<p>IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY
<p>Implementation of the strategy requires the following steps to be taken by the fi rm:
<p> Team members must remain totally motivated and committed to their tasks.
Team should be fully in the know of their quantitative and qualitative targets.
Qualitative targets like improvement in brand image and training of team members should be
<p>taken as seriously as the quantitative targets.
Individual members of the team should perform their tasks as also assist other members
<p>whenever necessary.
Team leader should act more as a coordinator than a monitor. His actions should inspire
<p>the team.
Assessment of achievement must be made fi rst by each member and then for the team jointly
<p>by the team at regular intervals without waiting for the year to end.
Success story of any member must be circulated within the team to inspire others and also to
<p>learn from the methods used to achieve the success. Failure should also be discussed, not
to push people down but to learn from any mistakes the losing team may have made.
<p>FEEDBACK
<p>The last mentioned point goes as feedback to the management for use in other areas in which the
fi rm may be operating. The feedback helps in reframing the strategies and therefore timely feedback
is extremely important for the continued success of the fi rm.
<p>Controls
<p>Management must have inbuilt control systems to ensure that one unscrupulous person cannot
hijack the entire organisation by deviating from the targets of the fi rm to promote his own targets. At
times, even sincere persons lose track in the rut of day-to-day operations. Punishment or correction
needs to be introduced at some stage before things go really wrong. The results should be compared
with the targets already accepted by the team, in the following manner:
<p>1. With the targets.
2. If the team has exceeded the targets, then with industry growth. The company must also know
<p>exactly the reasons of good performance so that it can be continued and replicated in other
areas as well.
<p>3. With historical fi gures.
4. With new targets if new competitors have emerged during the period under review.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management472
<p>5. With customer feedback about quality of goods and services offered by the team.
6. With the research and development group if improvements have been called for in the
<p>product.
<p>New Challenges in the Twenty-fi rst Century for Marketers
<p>Global politics and economics are the most pronounced factors affecting today&rsquo;s business. Open
markets, on the one hand, and economic zones, on the other, anti-dumping laws and quota systems
for imports by some nations, hostilities in many parts of the world, war-like situations and faster
communication, faster movements, have thrown up several challenges. For marketers these have
opened several new routes as also closed some old ones as given next:
<p>1. Quality standards at par internationally, ISO 9000 series.
2. Low labour costs.
3. A large technical workforce.
4. English as a known language.
5. Information technology (IT) and software expertise.
6. Presence of several multinational corporations (MNCs) already in the country.
7. Spread of the internet in the country
8. Emergence of e-signatures leading to e-commerce.
<p>Firms that can gear themselves up to the challenges have a bright future both nationally and in
the international markets.
<p>The Virtual Marts
<p>The internet or the web has the potential of becoming a force to reckon with as a marketing tool. As the
PC population increases both in homes and in the offi ces, surfi ng the internet will become more
popular. Bazee.com in India has started its business where sellers, both individual and fi rms, can
place their products for sale. Websites auctioning products, including airline tickets, have emerged.
These are only the tip of the proverbial iceberg and much more can be expected in the area of web
marketing.
<p>These virtual shops with little overheads can give the well-established supermarkets a run for
their money. The only negatives of virtual marts at present are their lack of credibility among Indian
buyers as also the fact that they take away the excitement associated with shopping. The Indian
housewife enjoys window shopping, bargaining and generally having a great time out of the house
in the course of shopping. Internet shopping denies her this experience. Also, unless a woman feels
the silk of a sari, she is not confi dent about buying it. Perhaps with time or some innovative, ingeni-
ous technique, women customers would overcome this hesitation.
<p>Hence, the marketer&rsquo;s route to success is as follows (see Figure 19.2).
Firms need to make a rolling marketing plan, which may be made for a year, but is reviewed every
<p>month and corrected if deviations are found in the business environment factors, both general and
competitive.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 473
<p>The marketing plan should contain the following:
<p>1. Executive summary giving the highlights of the plans, especially the control points.
2. General and competitive environment factors, new products from the competition, market
<p>growth forecasts and summary of the fi ndings of marketing research.
3. Comparative statement of strengths and weaknesses of the fi rm vis-&agrave;-vis competitors, with
<p>emphasis on the customer benefi ts derived from the usage of products from the fi rms, both its
own and those of its competitors.
<p>4. Profi table sales plan for the entire product available for sale, either by manufacture or by
purchase, taking the 4Ps and the people into account.
<p>5. Fixing individual quantitative and qualitative targets, qualitative targets could be in the nature
of continuous training programmes and market feedbacks.
<p>6. Profi t picture derived out of sales revenue and marketing expense budgets.
<p>The word strategy is more commonly used in planning by the defence forces. In the same parlance,
marketing in severe competitive markets is like facing a war-like situation where the competitor is
ready to gobble up fi rms not ready to face them. It becomes a do or die situation and hence all the
possible loopholes need to be plugged, which becomes easy by using a systematic planning and
control approach.
<p>Task for Students
Locate the changes taking place in the business environment and discuss how fi rms can take full
advantage of the same, despite severe competition in the market place.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>MARKET INFORMATION&mdash;INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
<p>In the fi rst half of twentieth century, all the information needed for management decisions came
from the sales team, who were considered the eyes and ears of the fi rm and gathered information
<p>Figure 19.2 Marketing Plan Dynamics</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management474
<p>for the company. Today, in the beginning of the twenty-fi rst century, the information required by
the management is immense and the information available is also huge. Naturally, the management
wants to have all possible relevant information before taking decisions. International marketing
research is one tool for gathering data, sifting it and isolating the relevant information. Information
technology has progressed so fast that it has, in many cases, taken over the primary responsibility of
business decisions.
<p>Competitive Advantage
<p>A fi rm, which has obtained accurate and timely information, gains competitive advantage over other
competing fi rms. Indian business and economy today is on the threshold of an information revolution.
Information converted into knowledge provides the fi rm with power, which it can use to overcome
obstacles in its way and dominate the market. Therefore, information or knowledge is an asset in
its own right.
<p>Information can be defi ned as organised, structured data relevant to the fi rm and hence having
meaning and utility for the fi rm. Thus the value of the information can be quantifi ed to remove the
abstract ideas attached to it. The decision depending on the information has a value to the fi rm. Focus-
ing on this aspect, it should be easy for the fi rm to assign a value to the data. In this context, market
research is undertaken by fi rms at a price. Firms try to locate previous similar situations and data
connected with them from secondary sources. They go to the customers and ask direct questions to
gather data, which can be converted into information and knowledge for decision-making.
<p>The information helps in decision-making both for upstream operations, that is, in transactions
with the suppliers, and in downstream operations, that is, in transactions with the buyers. Beyond
buying and selling, information about the suppliers and the buyers including transaction details
and actual situation negotiations leading to the transaction stays in the databank of the fi rm and is
frequently updated.
<p>The stored information can, in many cases, prove to be a money-spinner if properly utilised as
follows:
<p>1. Higher profi ts from sales because of the ability to sell more units per sale, have bigger sale
volumes, charge higher prices due to information on the customer and also due to customisation
of product and service and outbound logistics.
<p>2. Lower material cost through information on the suppliers, organisation of &lsquo;just in time&rsquo; supplies,
bulk ordering for lower price, economic inventory levels and inbound logistics.
<p>3. Marketing of the information itself to other fi rms (who may not be in direct competition with
the fi rm).
<p>It may not be easy to quantify the net gains of information as given here but with time it is quite
possible to develop a mathematical model, which would calculate the extra gains. In order that the
information remains profi table it has to remain updated and therefore the information mission should
create an infrastructure for information continuum. Information helps fi rms in better transaction
management and yet it remains in the background of quotations, delivery periods and payments.
Information on the customers&rsquo; real needs, buying habits and personality types provide a backdrop for
dealings with the customers. In this context, it becomes imperative that the information is authentic </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 475
<p>and real time information. It helps in value addition to the customers and, therefore, brings extra
profi ts to the sellers as discussed next.
<p>Product Customisation
Customised product for the target market segment comes through knowledge of the segment. The
sellers get better market share, can ask for higher prices and still keep the customers satisfi ed and
delighted. The fi rm can reduce the selling cost, cost of advertisements and distribution by making
the product more purchasable.
<p>Looking at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix (see Figure 19.3), the market position of
products is located on the level of market growth and the fi rm&rsquo;s market share. Since the upheavals in
the market place are taking place much faster now than ever before, there is a need to have the most
recent information. With more use, the information gives better results. Being useful in a time frame
only, there is an element of urgency, both in obtaining the information and in using the same. The
fi rm, which does it better and faster, is usually the winner. The time frame between a product moving
from the question mark quadrant to the star quadrant and from the star quadrant to the cash cow
quadrant is shortening due to information about new customer needs and new product developments,
both being interrelated. By the same theory, products land up faster in the dog quadrant now. The
product life cycle is shortening because of the information revolution.
<p>Figure 19.3 A BCG Matrix
<p>With real-time availability of information about customers&rsquo; preferences, major and minor modi-
fi cations and customisation of product becomes inevitable, causing the shortening of the life cycle of
products. Management, therefore, must give great consideration to the higher rate of obsolescence
of products while taking the basic investment decisions on manufacturing goods. More fi rms may
opt for outsourcing the product or at least the sub-assemblies to reduce the capital costs. It has also
spurred the research and development efforts of fi rms, which are required to keep the fi rm abreast
with the latest market needs.
<p>A major change occurring as a result is the defi nition of the industry; it is now defi ned in terms
of market or customer needs and not in terms of product specifi cations and its benefi ts to the cus-
tomer. Competition from fi rms other than conventional competitors is going to be a direct threat
as information-rich competitors can always redefi ne their products to suit the customer. (For example,
ready-to-eat food products compete with raw materials like pulses, fl our, vegetables, meat, fi sh and
poultry.)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management476
<p>It is, therefore, better to defi ne customer and market needs, buying characteristics and con-
sumer behaviour of the target market segment and match these with the product characteristics and
benefi ts occurring to the customers from the product rather than going about it in the reverse order
of fi rst selecting the product characteristics and benefi ts and then trying to match these with the
customer and market demands. The difference may appear trivial but in today&rsquo;s context it is vital for
the success of a fi rm.
<p>The information base has changed the distribution system in some products. Where time is of
vital importance, like airline bookings, computer communications have taken over the booking coun-
ters. In case of physical goods too, online sales and auctions may remove the need of supermarkets,
drug stores and over-the-counter sales. One can imagine the non-necessity of distribution channels,
huge market complexes and increase in profi t margins by virtue of non-payment of commission
to the channel members. The benefi ts could be passed on to the customers or kept by the fi rm for
diversifi cation and growth.
<p>Distribution Channels
The role of distribution channels has been of sellers of products only. The sooner they assume the
additional role of information provider about the authentic market demands, consumer behaviour
patterns and buying habits, the faster the channel members will fi nd themselves back in the thick of the
fi rm&rsquo;s business. Multi-brand dealers will ultimately have to choose their favourite brand, to which they
would provide real-time information. They would also, perhaps, stop representing other fi rms.
<p>Advertising and Promotion
Knowledge of the customer&rsquo;s mindset, his aspirations, values and desires would enable the sellers
to communicate with him better with an appropriate language, provide the right incentives during
promo-tions and get better results. Advertising agencies are on the look out for such information and
they pay research agencies well to acquire this information.
<p>Market Information System
Computers have made information banks a reality and real-time information update is happening
today. The IT revolution is changing the market place, buyer&rsquo;s attitudes in time-saving internet pur-
chases and much more is happening everyday in this area. Cellphones, mobile internet, business
transactions on cellphones and SMS are slowly but surely changing how business is done and fi rms
would ignore these paradigm shifts at their own risk.
<p>Task for Students
Discuss the ways in which the IT revolution can be harnessed to the advantage of a fi rm.

<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 477
<p>EXPORT AND IMPORT STRATEGIES
<p>Each country has its entry barriers and other rules and regulations that guide the import and export
business from and to that country. On these the companies depend for the selection of foreign markets,
products for such markets, product differentiations, if any is required, and product pricing. Market-
ing strategies, distribution patterns and communication strategies are developed after the companies
assesses the host country&rsquo;s rules for foreigners in the country.
<p>In India, 1991 can be considered as the watershed year when the country decided to open up its
economy to foreign players. The earlier period had seen restrictive international businesses with
heavy embargo on imports. It was meant to give fi llip to the indigenous industry. However, since
it precluded international competition, it also restricted Indian exports. The policy of fostering local
business thus became counterproductive as Indian business had little incentive to go overseas and
consequently, the Indian consumer had little choice of products and of desired high quality.
<p>With the opening up of the economy, the country has been virtually invaded by foreign players mak-
ing it almost impossible for Indian businesses to survive without entering the international market.
This has resulted in the country, including the government, placing great emphasis on international
business. Hence, instead of just planning import substitutions, companies are going ahead with their
own thrust in foreign markets. The Government of India&rsquo;s trade policy favours the export business.
<p>Today&rsquo;s export&ndash;import (EXIM) policy focuses more on export incentives than on import substitution.
Companies need to obtain the export&ndash;import code number from the Directorate General of Foreign
Trade. The benefi ts that accrue to exports are listed next:
<p>1. The consumer gets better quality product with a wide choice of products for each category.
2. Exporters get easy access to raw materials and components for increased manufacturing.
3. Exporters get to improve their manufacturing technology to keep pace with the world to make
<p>them competitive in the international market, especially with their inherent low-cost labour.
4. Companies can plan to capture a sizeable quantity of market share.
5. The EXIM policy covers export-related plans of the Government of India.
6. The Handbook of Procedures, Volume 1 (Government of India 2002), contains EXIM procedures
<p>for exporters, importers and licensors.
7. The Handbook of Procedures, Volume 2 (Government of India 2002), contains input&ndash;output norms
<p>for determining the advance licensing norms.
8. ITC (HS) is the classifi cation of export and import items as a reference manual that enables
<p>exporters in determining if the product is export worthy or not.
<p>Under the Customs Act 1962, the Government of India prohibits the import and export of certain
products, completely or partially, subject to the Government Offi cial Gazette. These restrictions cover
areas like protection of public morals, protection of human, animal or plant life, protection of patents,
trademarks and copyrights, use of prison labour, protection of national treasures of artistic, historic
or archaeological interest, conservation of exhaustible resources, trade of fi ssion materials, arms and
war equipment.
<p>Likewise the export of certain products can be regulated under the trade policy. Export promotion
has been given importance in the policy as follows:
<p>Duty drawback is given as refund of the customs duty paid on imports of inputs used in export
goods, based on industry norms. These are available to all exporters. For manufacturer-exporters, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management478
<p>the duty drawback is fi xed for the brands exported. In some cases, the import is allowed for
input products meant for use in export products. For capital goods import there is a 5 per cent
concession on custom duty but with defi ned export obligations on the part of the importer of
the equipment.
<p>Besides this, there are duty remission schemes for merchant exporters. These operate through a
duty entitlement passbook scheme as well. The goods sent to export processing zones (EPZs) are
considered &lsquo;deemed exports&rsquo; for the purpose.
<p>The scheme or duty concession on capital goods benefi ts the companies in the export markets, as
the goods cost much less than otherwise. Companies can also plan to set up the unit in the export
promotion area as an export-oriented unit to get duty-free import of capital goods.
<p>The government has provided for advance licensing to help in duty-free imports of materials
needed for export goods especially for export-oriented units (EOUs). It is also true for EPZs. In the case
of special economic zones (SEZs), there is the requirement of having a positive foreign exchange fl ow
for becoming eligible for duty-free import of capital goods. Agricultural export zones, exporters of
agricultural products, can get recognition as an export house, trading house, star trading house or
superstar trading house by meeting the requirements associated with them. Software technology
parks get the same treatment, along with the electronic hardware technology parks like export house,
trading house, star trading house and superstar trading house and get recognition due to them
after meeting the export performance levels associated with them. The government also provides
assistance for the development of infrastructure for export and associated activities.
<p>Funds are available for creating new export promotion parks, SEZs, agriculture-based zones,
setting up electronic infrastructure for exports, forepart from equity participation in infrastructure
projects in these zones. The category distinction of export units is given next:
<p>1. Export house: Rs 150 million (average); FOB/FOR value of exports during the previous three
licensing years.
<p>2. Trading house/International service export house: Rs 1 billion (average); FOB/FOR value
of exports during the previous three licensing years.
<p>3. Star trading house: Rs 5 billion (average); FOB/FOR value of exports during the previous
three licensing years.
<p>4. Superstar trading house: Rs 20 billion (average); FOB/FOR value of exports during the
previous three licensing years.
<p>These state units get the following benefi ts:
<p>1. Self declaration for customs clearance.
2. Priority fi xation of input&ndash;output norms.
3. Priority fi nance for medium- and long-term capital requirements as per Reserve Bank of India
<p>(RBI) norms.
4. Compulsory bank negotiation of document not required, while it remains as the norm.
5. Foreign earnings in foreign exchange possible up to 100 per cent.
6. Repatriation period enhancement up to 180&ndash;380 days.
<p>In the twenty-fi rst century, the global economy is growing and barriers to international trade are
reducing. This has resulted in an increase in the export and import trade between countries. For proper
growth of exports the following are required:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 479
<p>1. To understand the strategies for planning exports and imports.
2. Locating the intermediate organisations for exports.
3. Understanding the organisation of export fi nance.
4. Understanding counter-trade.
<p>Exporting companies should start by making an assessment of the export potential in the chosen
countries/markets. They can then correlate the possible opportunities with the requirement of
resources in the selected areas. They should get information about the countries from foreign gov-
ernment agencies, banks and fi nancial institutions. Market selection can be done as follows:
<p>1. Actively select the markets by using the marketing research techniques in the same market or
similar markets located in the proximity of the selected markets.
<p>2. Passively select the markets by responding to enquiries.
<p>For formulating export strategies, the following need to be done:
<p>1. Defi ne both long-term and short-term objectives.
2. Plan specifi c tactics for entering the market.
3. Plan a detailed schedule of activities and deadlines focusing on results expected.
4. Allocation of resources for the tasks.
5. Determine the distribution channels, both direct ones like sales representatives, distributors
<p>and agents and indirect ones like host-country importers.
<p>There are export marketing intermediaries as given next:
<p>1. Export management companies, which obtain purchase orders for a group of exports.
2. Export trading companies, which service the overseas buyers.
3. Companies like the Japanese trading companies, which start by getting the raw materials and
<p>then fi nd the export markets.
4. Foreign freight forwarding companies, which arrange for export license where required, shipping
<p>and warehousing facilities.
<p>Summing up, companies planning exports should work out a good strategy by assessing the export
potential in the selected markets through marketing research, obtain expert advice for the selected
countries, select the markets, formulate the strategies by determining the 4Ps, the product, its price,
the distribution channels, direct or indirect, and the best way of communicating with the market
through advertising.
<p>Export Financing
<p>Companies have to understand the following while deciding about product pricing:
<p>1. Currency of payment&mdash;its fl uctuations: In case of highly-fl uctuating currencies, it is a good idea
to insure the payments at known levels.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management480
<p>2. Transportation&mdash;its costs: The different modes of transportation&mdash;air, sea or land, delivery time
for each on average and the cost of each.
<p>3. Import duties in the host countries.
4. Possible mark-ups.
<p>Companies should understand the best methods of receiving payments for exports made. Payments
can be received as follows:
<p>1. Cash in advance.
2. Bills of exchange used in commercial transactions like sight drafts or time drafts.
3. Letter of credit (LC), which should be irrevocable and confi rmed.
4. Financing receivables like EXIM bank loans, guarantees and Export Credit and Guarantee
<p>Corporation (ECGC) insurance.
<p>In counter-trade, the possibilities are of barter trade like what used to take place between India
and the USSR and was known as rupee trade. The other option is offset trade where the exporters
assist the buyers in earning the required foreign exchange for the imports.
<p>The Import Plans
<p>Companies that want to import should understand the following:
<p>1. Procedures for imports like custom duties and customs brokers.
2. Payments to be made by releasing the bill of lading or the airway bill for imports through air.
3. Storage of imports.
4. Long-term import agreements for keeping price parity, quality assurance and ready
<p>availability.
<p>To sum up, the price of the product, the method of payment and fi nancing of receivables are the
three important issues that relate to export fi nancing. Summing up, companies need to know the main
features of export and import strategies, the types of export intermediaries available, export fi nancing,
price, payment methods, fi nancing receivables and methods of counter-trade. Furthermore, for large
companies, export becomes imperative because large companies must export for increasing sales.
<p>Collaborative Plans
<p>A company getting into international business has to select the method of going overseas like export-
ing, joint ventures, franchising or forming a fully-owned subsidiary. The decision would depend on
the company&rsquo;s own experience, competitive factors, political factors, economic risks and the assets
needed for the business. The choice would be made for the method that has the greatest synergy
with the company.
<p>Companies should understand certain issues as discussed next. Companies need to understand
the forms of doing international business, licensing, exporting, franchising, management contracts,
turnkey operations, apart from the variables which decide the choice of operational method and the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 481
<p>problems in managing them in host countries. The host countries may have in place legal restrictions
for overseas companies. They may have a ban on certain alternate methods. Companies need to under-
stand their tax structures, anti-trust regulations and limits of remittances of funds like dividends to
the home country. The choice could be affected by the cost. External handling may become low in
cost as volumes are small and if a specialty company has excess capacity.
<p>Variables that affect the choice are experience as greater experience leads to greater involvement.
Competition changes the choice factor and the risks as external forms spread the risk and controls
and internal handling means more controls and no sharing of profi ts.
<p>Collaborative Strategies
<p>Companies must understand that if their product that is meant for the host country is complex and
is a high technology product, it is better to start marketing the product as sold in the home country.
In case the company has got a good base in the host country or the economic standards of the home
and host countries are alike, the same product would suffi ce.
<p>Companies have to accept that in host countries they have to offer rights to intangible property
like trademarks, patents and copyright as the host countries&rsquo; associate has to pay royalty to the com-
pany. Technology can be exchanged through cross-licensing, while the reasons for licensing could be
that the strategic product does not form a part of the company&rsquo;s major product range. The problems
in the licensing procedure are as follows:
<p>1. Controls because of non- or low-utilisation of the license.
2. Poor quality of the product.
3. Inviting future competitors.
4. Maintenance of secrecy during negotiations before the agreement is signed.
5. Determining the type of payment system like fi xed charges or usage-based charges, value to
<p>give license as compared to the cost to the company for providing the license.
<p>Franchise Arrangement
<p>Companies can offer franchise arrangement to an associate company in the host country. Franchise
arrangements are specialised forms of license involving continuous infl ow of capital by the franchiser
into the host country&rsquo;s franchisee. At times there can be a master franchisee and under him sub-
franchisees too. The possible problems that face the franchiser are:
<p>1. The host country might not accept highly-standardised operations in the franchise.
2. If the standardisation is of a low level, it becomes less attractive in the host country.
<p>Management Contracts
<p>At times companies could get into management contracts, especially when the operations owned
have been expropriated or they are in trouble. In such conditions, the host country gets technical as </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management482
<p>well as managerial expertise without the use of foreign direct investment (FDI). The company can get
out of the risk areas by joining hands with an insider but knowing fully well that the insider could
become a competitor.
<p>Turnkey Operations
<p>Construction companies usually use these. The contracts start with feasibility studies and are followed
by studies of means of protecting the contractor and the fi nal bill is paid on satisfactory completion
of the operations.
<p>Summarising, the types of FDIs comprise licensing, franchising, management contracts and turnkey
operations and contract agreements, with equity participation, with or without controls.
<p>Companies can obtain foreign technology by creating a monitoring unit for scanning journals and
databases. They can contract the work to research organisations and even start research projects with
both foreign and local companies. They can establish their research and development operations in
foreign countries using their infrastructure and trained manpower.
<p>Companies can plan international operations taking advantage of collaborative strategies with
ownership shared with the host-country companies. Such shared ownerships help with the advantages
of better control of foreign operations and profi ts while the main disadvantages are the confl icts with
local stockholders regarding payment of dividend and public disclosures on the company&rsquo;s activities.
Shared ownership can be considered for quick expansion geographically besides spreading the re-
search cost over a larger base of sales. It helps in having the resources of both the companies complement
each other. A cash-rich company complements a technology-rich company. In some cases, the shared
ownership could be a legal condition for entering a country. The company could have a larger voice
in management of shared ownership due to its better brand equity. Companies can use equity as a
control mechanism in shared ownership if remaining ownership is widespread and fragmented and
voting rights stay with a particular class of shareholders. The success of a joint venture depends on
the compatibility of the sharing partners.
<p>Management of Foreign Contracts
<p>The best way to manage foreign contracts is to continuously monitor performance apart from under-
standing if the operation is ripe enough for a takeover. The other important areas are resolution of
confl icts and disputes arising out of the contract.
<p>Summing up, companies have to employ different methods for different countries and for differ-
ent products as the diversity increases; the task of managing and coordinating it becomes arduous
and complex. Apart from working on collaborative strategies, a company has to include variables that
need to be understood before selecting the operational form, the legal conditions, costs, competition,
risks and problems associated with controls. The important forms of operation are licensing, franchise
management contracts, joint ventures and turnkey operations apart from wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Sometimes confl icts and disputes arise causing problems in managing foreign operations.
<p>Companies have to decide about the proportion of resources they want to offer to the home man-
agement and to the overseas operations. In this way, companies may have to plan separate types of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 483
<p>forms in reference to internal and external activities and their handling by the company. The fi nal
choice of the form to be used in overseas operations should be based on the company&rsquo;s corporate ob-
jectives. However, the choice involves trade-offs between the company&rsquo;s objectives.
<p>International Business Controls
<p>Companies involved in international business have to understand the methods of controls in order
to achieve their objectives. These controls should focus on planning, implementation, evaluation and
modifi cation or correction of strategies for reaching the goals of the company. The organisational
structure and its culture help in making controls and success easy to achieve. They should learn the
planning loop, possible organisational structures. They should decide the decision-making levels and
whether the decision-making location should be centralised or decentralised.
<p>The Planning Loop
<p>Companies have to intertwine the objectives with internal and external constraints. They should then
assert the vision, mission, goals and objectives&mdash;the strategic intents. They should plan their strategies,
implement them, place the control points in place and take suitable corrective actions when they
miss out on their objectives in the given time frame.
<p>The planning loop should focus on an analysis of the company&rsquo;s corporate resources, besides set-
ting up the international corporate objectives. Next, the host country&rsquo;s general business environment
should be understood and analysed by studying the following factors as they have an impact on
business:
<p>1. Demographic factors
2. Social factors
3. Cultural factors
4. Political factors
5. Legal factors
6. Macroeconomic factors
7. Technology factors
8. Global factors
<p>The company should also understand the host country&rsquo;s competitive environment as applied to
its products with the help of Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force Model.
<p>Next, the company should look for alternative strategies and then select the optimum strategy for
best results in achieving the objectives. It should be followed with implementation plans and control
points to check aberrations and errors in time to nip them in the bud. This would lead to reanalysis
of the resource deployment and corrections in the same where needed.
<p>The company should defi ne the level of foreign operations and their relative importance for the
company. Naturally, the more important operations would need greater higher management support
and hence should have a higher level of reporting by the foreign operations. They can plan to have </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management484
<p>a separate international division for the important host country. The company can go for a product
or geographic grouping structure within the functional home base structure. The company can plan
on a matrix structure with reporting to product, geographic and functional operations. The structure
could be a hierarchy based one or of some equals working together for the common goals.
<p>DECISION-MAKING LOCATION
<p>Centralised decision-making is usually through the top management of the home country. Most
companies, however, have neither centralised nor totally decentralised decision levels. The selection of
decision levels is based on the distance factor, levels of communication technology in the host country
and effi ciency factors. The centralised decision level is preferred in case the movement of goods is
international, where decisions must be made quickly and standardisation is the key to success. In
such cases, the global competitive position takes precedence over the country-by-country competitive
position of the company.
<p>Centralised decisions are preferred where the host country&rsquo;s conditions are similar to the conditions
in the home country, the product is uniform and the decisions have far-reaching importance for the
company. However, it must be taken into consideration that centralised decision-making may hurt
the host-country managers as they are then rendered as just implementers of the decisions with no
role in making them and this can become a major de-motivating factor for them.
<p>The level of decision-making should depend on the competence of individuals, the cost of wrong
decisions that the company will have to pay for at each level and the impact of the decisions on the
company&rsquo;s performance in its totality.
<p>THE CONTROL MECHANISM
<p>Companies face diffi culties in setting up control systems as the corporate culture of the host subsidiary
or joint venture could be quite different from the culture of the home country. The timelines of reports
is an important facet of controls. Besides, a company can face the following problems while planning
for controls in international business:
<p>1. The difference in the standard operating ratios in different countries for comparing with the
budget fi gures.
<p>2. Evaluation required for both the operating results as well as the host-country managers as some
factors would be beyond their control.
<p>3. The host country&rsquo;s companies that have been acquired may have managers with a high level
of autonomy in their operations.
<p>4. Local controls may be diffi cult to remove when changing from a multi-domestic strategy to a
global one.
<p>Besides these problem there can be special situations needing a different planning process for
controls as given next:
<p>1. Where the legal provisions and liabilities and taxation are different for subsidiaries and own
branch offi ces.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Markets for the Twenty-first Century, Imports and Exports 485
<p>2. Shared ownership with a company from the host country can create problems in deciding about
control yardsticks and control points.
<p>3. The duality of operating forms, one for equity and the other of non-equity based would create
special control problems.
<p>Summing up, in the international business controls are more diffi cult due to the following
factors:
<p>1. Geographic distances.
2. Cultural diversities.
3. Having different strategies for different countries in which the company is operating.
4. Greater uncontrolled areas.
5. Problems of getting the right data.
6. Rapid changes in both the general and the competitive business environments.
<p>Summarising, the planning loop defi nes the company&rsquo;s strategic intents, its resources and their
utilisation and the choice of going for centralised or decentralised controls and decision levels.

<p>20 International Management for
Marketing Personnel
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Companies in the international market have to locate the right marketing persons who are able to
independently create a market for the company&rsquo;s products in host countries. While initially the com-
pany&rsquo;s own personnel would be ideally suited, they may not be fully aware of the host country&rsquo;s business
environment. Local recruits and third-country employees can be suitable options. Home-country
marketing personnel operating in the host country need to be highly motivated self-starters and the
company should be able to trust them to take independent decisions for the benefi t of the company.
This chapter explores the various possibilities for optimising the human efforts in the international
market.</p>
<br>
</div>

<p>International Marketing Management488
<p>Human resources (HR) people need to know the pulse of the organisation and the market. This
will enable them to retain the best possible marketing personnel and reduce marketing team
tension and indirectly help in containing the attrition levels in marketing.
<p>Let us look at the present-day organisation chart of some prominent fi rms (Figure 20.1).
<p>Figure 20.1 Organisational Chart for HR
<p>The CEO heads the organisation and the departmental heads report to him, one of them being the
head of the human resources department (HRD). One of the main functions of HR is the recruitment
of staff, both white and blue collared. With the realisation of their dependence on the successful
functioning of their personnel, fi rms have started giving HR function the importance due to it.
<p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS VARIANTS
<p>In international business there are a number of variations as given next:
<p>1. Home country has the international headquarters, with regional offi ces at the host country or
countries.
<p>2. There can be marketing or outsourcing operations in a third country, which would need offi ces
located there.
<p>3. The HR activities could be centralised or given to the host country&rsquo;s management.
4. In most cases, the senior or key persons are selected centrally at the home country and deployed
<p>in other countries.
5. These recruits could be from either the home country, host country or even a third country,
<p>depending on the requirement or specifi c needs of the person.
<p>HRD ACTIVITIES
<p>The normal activities in the HRD are:
<p>1. Recruitment of managers, supervisors, workers for each of the functional areas like marketing,
fi nance, operations, HR, legal and technical, for example, research and development.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Management for Marketing Personnel 489
<p> 2. Training of the recruited staff.
3. Staff positioning, depending on work needs and norms established on performance output.
4. Performance reviews of the staff.
5. Salary and wage management.
6. Leave records and leave rules for the different category of staff.
7. Career planning, increments and promotions.
8. Disciplinary actions as and when needed against erring staff members.
9. Administrative functions and record keeping.
10. In the twenty-fi rst century, the role of HR has widened, as the HR director is part of the top
<p>management decision group.
<p>The HR function differs in the international arena because even a simple error overseas can become
disastrous for the fi rm. Therefore of topmost importance is the recruitment of the right person for
any given job.
<p>SUITABILITY CRITERIA FOR STAFF
<p>The following criteria are used to decide the suitability of candidates:
<p> 1. Age.
2. Qualifi cations.
3. Technical skills required for the job.
4. Experience in similar jobs.
5. Experience in working in the host country.
6. Knowledge of the host country&rsquo;s language, culture, work norms and ethical standards.
7. Candidates own ethical standards (this is diffi cult to assess; fi rms should go by the previous
<p>employer&rsquo;s references).
8. Experience of any international work.
9. Capacity for concentrated efforts for results.
10. Capacity and ability for team work. This would include forming teams with home-country
<p>employees, host-country and even third-country employees.
<p>KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOST COUNTRY
<p>For senior positions, knowledge of the following areas would be necessary:
<p>1. The host country&rsquo;s tax laws and the taxation period (January&ndash;December or April&ndash;March, like
in India).
<p>2. The host country&rsquo;s monetary system.
3. The host country&rsquo;s borrowing interest rates.
4. The host country&rsquo;s labour laws.
5. The host country&rsquo;s laws relating to expatriates, their income tax and home leave payments.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management490
<p> 6. Education system for the children of expatriates from the home country.
7. Infrastructure, logistics and communication systems of the host country.
8. Host country&rsquo;s language. (This could be optional in case of an otherwise qualifi ed candidate
<p>because in most countries today English is spoken and understood at least in business dealings.
English has become the business language of the world.)
<p> 9. The host country&rsquo;s currency, its fl uctuations and its parity with the home country&rsquo;s currency
and with the US dollar.
<p>10. Norms for visa, work permits, travel within the host country and outside.
11. Housing, weather, availability of essential items for daily needs. (In ITI Mankapur near Gonda
<p>in Uttar Pradesh, the Alcatel France staff had to get even their food stuff fl own in on a weekly
basis from France.)
<p>12. Yardstick for paying salary and wages to employees.
13. Medical facilities near the workplace and their costs.
14. Insurance plans including accident insurance and medical insurance available in the host
<p>country.
15. The level of governmental interference in business, recruitment and functioning of the fi rm.
16. Ethical norms of the host government. The fi rm must have a policy of dealing with this pheno-
<p>menon as steering away from the right path could prove to be very expensive for the fi rm.
17. Parity of salary with host-country managers. This could be diffi cult to achieve as the home-
<p>country managers would get overseas allowances, education allowances and home leave
payments, which would not be applicable to host-country managers.
<p>The fi rm has to understand that in another country the personal life of an employee gets disturbed
and for this the employee has to be compensated with paid home leave and other benefi ts like education
allowance for their children, health cover if they are staying in the home country.
<p>On the fl ip side, the salaries and perks given to the home-country expatriates can become a sore
point for the host-country employees. Even technicians coming to India from affl uent nations get far
more pay than the top managers of India. In India, junior managers from Western countries come and
stay in fi ve-star hotels, while home-country middle managers cannot afford to stay there.
<p>Most multinational corporations (MNCs) have training-cum-orientation programmes for managers
who are transferred to other countries, where issues concerning the culture of the country, its language,
currency and schooling and medical facilities are covered.
<p>When fi rms start international business, they place their own country&rsquo;s managers in place in the
other countries. Gradually, as the local managers learn the ways of the home-country fi rm, local man-
agers replace the expatriates. They prove to be more effective as they know the country well. They
also cost the fi rm less.
<p>At times, home-country managers are unable to perform in the host country, which leads to nega-
tive results for the fi rm and the losses are much more in size than the losses a fi rm suffers in the local
markets. Additionally, once the fi rm loses its grip on the market, it is diffi cult, time consuming and
expensive to regain the position internationally.
<p>Initially, a lot of software export from India was in the shape of human beings; software engineers
were relocated from India to the USA, where they developed software for American fi rms. Thus, the
American fi rms were able to get the best software people at a fraction of the cost of local American
engineers. This resulted in fewer jobs for the local engineers. The government of the US had to force these
fi rms to pay the expatriates the same salaries as the locals. This stopped &lsquo;body shopping&rsquo; from India
and the result is that the same kind of software is now developed in India and is exported from here.</p>

<br>
<p>International Management for Marketing Personnel 491
<p>Summarising the status of HR operations in today&rsquo;s business, we fi nd the following:
<p>1. Sending staff and managers from the home country to the host country can be problematic due
to different labour laws, economic differences and cultural variance. For specifi c skills, people
are sent before the host country people can be trained in those skills.
<p>2. Salary and wage can be different as also the productivity levels and norms.
3. Working styles differ in most countries, which could result in friction between the home-country
<p>management and the host country management.
4. What is the level of importance given by home country top management to the host country
<p>management.
<p>To overcome these problems, most fi rms organise special training and orientation programmes
before the employee is sent to the host country. The fi rms then try to locate local talent, train them in
the special skills and fi nally these people replace the expatriates. The local manager, if selected with
care, brings about economy (because he costs the company less than his home-country counterpart)
and can be more effi cient as he knows the local conditions better.
<p>The international organisation of fi rms are shown in Figure 20.2.
<p>Figure 20.2 The Organisational Structure of International Firms
<p>The home-country managers select the persons who manage the host country&rsquo;s operations and
therefore report to them. The relationship between the two needs to be clearly delineated to enable the
working plans; policies and methods are adopted from the general managerial ethos of the host country.
The home country&rsquo;s Seven S Model, comprising shared values style, staffi ng, systems, structure,
strategy, and skills, may not be totally appropriate in the host country and the local management
must be empowered to modify the model to suit the local conditions.
<p>The home country management usually sends its best persons to look after their international
operations. This helps the fi rm in establishing itself in the new environs quickly and well. These
expatriates are more than welcome by the home country management and they usually get higher
status on return as a reward for the good job done in the host country. Top managers in the home
country watch each and every step taken by the managers posted in host countries. At times written
guarantees are given to those posted out about the permanency of their jobs in the home-country
operations.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management492
<p>SEVEN S MODEL
<p>The Seven S Model needs to be studied with reference to the differences and similarities of the seven
Ss in the home and the host country as follows:
<p>1. Shared values: Shared values are the higher level ideals, which the fi rm&rsquo;s promoters inculcate in
the fi rm&rsquo;s employees. These values refl ect the business ethics, work culture and human issues like
not just providing medical benefi ts to employees but going beyond that and providing employees
and their kin the best possible treatment, under any circumstances, when the need arises.
<p> The divergence of shared values between the home country business and that of the host
country&rsquo;s business ethos needs to be fully understood and a bridge needs to be provided for
spanning the gap. If the home country business believes in age as hierarchy in promotions
and the host country believes only in merit as the promotion criteria, a balance should be
created to cover the divergence, like giving due weight to age while taking merit into account
for promotions.
<p>2. Style: Firms have work style differences as one fi rm could employ hands-on training while
another fi rm could give classroom training. One CEO could be friendly even with junior
managers and the other aloof. These differences can make or break a fi rm in another country,
as the values, cultural and ethical, do not span across countries.
<p>3. Staffi ng: Some fi rms believe in promoting people from within the organisation while others
recruit from outside. In another country, recruitment could also be from a third country. This
works well if the business milieu of the host country is understood well.
<p>4. Systems: It is said that in fi rms people do not work, it is the systems that work. The following
types of systems can be seen in a fi rm:
<p> Resourcing systems&mdash;human resource, fi nance and information resource systems
Accounting systems
Recruitment systems
Reporting systems
Control systems
<p> In resource systems, the entire business dynamics comes in to play, including the resource-
fulness of the business promoter. Accounting systems can vary from country to country and
most fi rms working overseas like to maintain two sets of accounting records, one for the home
country and the other for the host country, which should be in line with the practices followed
in that country. Recruitment of local staff should normally follow the pattern associated with
the host country. Reporting systems should be of two types, one for the home country reporting
and the other for the host country. Control systems normally follow the fi rm&rsquo;s own systems
as the entire success of overseas operations depends largely on this system. Control systems
delegate authority with accountability to the managers with catch points to ensure that they
do not go berserk with power.
<p>5. Structure: The organisational structure wields a great deal of infl uence on the fi rm&rsquo;s outcome.
The hierarchy-based structure is accepted worldwide and yet fl at organisations with lower
levels of decision-making have become quite common. Virtual organisations and networking are
also in the picture as fi rms are resorting to outsourcing a lot of their products, assemblies, sub-
assemblies to cut down on costs. International business has to accept the norms of the host country
initially till they are ready to innovate and become more compact, streamlined and effective.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Management for Marketing Personnel 493
<p>6. Strategy: The fi rm&rsquo;s strategies can be defi ned as its plans and policies and the action it takes in
line with these plans and policies. As the business environment of countries is never the same,
the plans and policies of one country would need to be suitably modifi ed for them to succeed
in another country.
<p>7. Skills: The skills of a fi rm are part of its core competencies, as one fi rm may be good in electronics
and the other in microbiology, while a third one in marketing. The home country skills need to
be fi ne-tuned to be of signifi cance in the host country.
<p>It is only after a study has been made and the seven Ss scrutinised in all their dimensions that one
can hope for success in an alien land.
<p>INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE
<p>As there is a physical distance between the home and the host countries, it is important to have good
channels of information fl ow. While the internet, fax and video conferencing are available in several
countries, the communication between two countries must be clear, fast and confi dential. Leased
telephone lines are available in some countries. Similar facilities are needed internationally too.
<p>The home offi ce has to communicate policy matters, new product launches and promotional plans,
all of which would be extremely useful to the competing fi rms. Therefore, confi dentiality of commu-
nication is of utmost importance.
<p>In several countries, the local language is not English, which makes communicating with them a lot
more diffi cult. Business English has its own subtleties, besides some words of common use. It is a good
idea to learn these terms. Many fi rms keep their foreign subsidiaries in tune with the home offi ce&rsquo;s
plans and policies and for this purpose they publish a newsletter giving an expos&eacute; of their plans.
<p>Translation of local languages can be a tricky problem as literal translation can rob the meaning
from the matter. Only experts in both the languages can do a proper translation work and then it is
worth the effort.
<p>With the fl ow of capital and technology worldwide, it is imperative that the HR is kept on top
priority for gaining and maintaining excellence in overseas operations.
<p>Expatriate managers have the following tasks to perform in the host countries:
<p>1. Managing the fi rm&rsquo;s operations in the host country with the home country&rsquo;s expertise in
management and with the local work culture.
<p>2. Maintaining technological excellence with the local workforce.
3. Maintaining high-level government contacts.
4. Keeping a high level of public relations through communications, including advertising and
<p>publicity.
5. Understanding consumer behaviour, his needs for products and, more importantly, associated
<p>services and fulfi lling the same.
6. Training and development of local managers, who would eventually take over the reins of the
<p>host country operations.
7. Understanding the business environment of the country, both the general business environ-
<p>ment and the competitive business environment and the country&rsquo;s cultural environment to be
able to optimise results.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management494
<p>FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT (FDI)
<p>Direct investments made by foreign organisations are followed by their control on the concerned
business. This becomes a cause for concern for the host government and the people. However, these
investments are welcome especially in the developing countries if they bring progress and expansion
for the MNC fi rm and the host country.
<p>While direct investment overseas generally is acquired by transferring capital from one country
to another, capital usually is not the only contribution made by the investor or the only means of
gaining equity. Firms make direct investment overseas to expand markets by selling abroad or to
acquire foreign resources. Firms with foreign investments tend to be more profi table and have more
stable sales and earnings.
<p>Direct investment, because of the implied control, permits fi rms to make decisions to maximise
global performance. It also helps to serve global effi ciency; however, countries distort movements
by restricting the inward or outward fl ow and by giving incentives to fi rms to locate their operations
within their boundaries.
<p>FOREIGN EXCHANGE
<p>Domestic and international transactions differ in the use of more than one currency for international
trade. The special cheques and other instruments for making the payments abroad are referred to
collectively as foreign exchange. It is important to know and understand the terms and defi nitions
of foreign exchange and how the foreign exchange market operates for immediate and long-term
transactions.
<p>A key aspect of exchange of currency is its convertibility. Some governments impose restrictions
to control access to foreign exchange, depending on their foreign exchange reserves. International
banking is the means for facilitating the fl ow of international transactions. It is the link between the
economies of the world. There is speculation in buying and selling of a commodity where activities
contain both an element of risk and chance of huge profi ts. There is a general belief that currency
speculators are destabilising the world monetary system. Speculators may push the market in the
direction it needs to go. In this case, by forcing governments to confront market realities, they may
actually be contributing to long-term stability.
<p>It is therefore important to understand how the exchange rates are set and why the rates change.
This would help the MNC managers in making decisions that are dependent on those changes. There
are three categories of exchange rate arrangements, according to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), as discussed next:
<p>1. Fixed rates
2. Limited fl exibility
3. More fl exible
<p>If the arrangement does not refl ect the real position regarding the supply and demand of a currency,
a black market develops for the same. However, the major systems for determining exchange rates are
freely fl uctuating rates, managed fi xed rates and automatic fi xed rates. Rates are affected by infl ation,
interest rate differentials and technical factors.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Management for Marketing Personnel 495
<p>Balance of payment statistics, economic fundamentals and technical factors are used to predict
exchange rate movements and fl uctuations. After World War II, it was thought that a system of fi xed
exchange rates would help to bring stability and growth to the free world. It was, however, realised
later on that that system created rigidity rather than stability and the system was restructured to
allow greater exchange rate fl exibility.
<p>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
<p>1. The success of international marketing depends on the team and the team leader. Discuss the
optimum human resource management pattern for the achievement of corporate goals.
<p>2. Home country management feels comfortable with their own nationals managing the host
country operations. However, local issues, which are important, can best be dealt with by local
managers. Discuss the role of local, third-country and home country managers.
<p>3. How does HRM differ in international business from domestic business?
4. What is the relationship required between home and host country management?
5. What are the difference between expatriates, locals, home country persons and third-country
<p>persons?</p>

<p>21 International Marketing Audit
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
This chapter provides hands-on learning techniques to students. They will learn about the entire
gamut of international marketing as they are required to actually and physically conduct an audit on
any company engaged in the area of international marketing as a part of this chapter. This chapter
will help to develop their confi dence, build resourcefulness and give them a proper industry interface
and, therefore, may need the strategic support of the teaching fraternity.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 497
<p>The most interesting and educative way of learning international marketing is by conducting
marketing audit of a company from the list given next:
<p>1. An Indian company involved in exports.
2. An Indian multinational corporation (MNC).
3. A foreign MNC.
<p>The starting point for the audit is understanding the general business environment factors of the
host countries and their impact on the company&rsquo;s international marketing efforts, as given next.
<p>THE HOST COUNTRY&rsquo;S GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
<p>The following need to be studied, assessed, screened and monitored in the context of the country for
correct planning of marketing strategies:
<p>1. Demographic factors: These are brought out in the census of the country, factors like population
dispersion in towns and villages, income levels for families, sex ratios and number of people
affi liated to a particular religion. Shifts of population from villages to towns and from small
towns to metro towns provide business opportunities, which no marketer can afford to miss.
For a start, low-cost housing, clothing, transportation and eateries are needed.
<p>2. Social factors: Factors like the increase of working women in towns at all levels of income
are very important. The rise of women in the workforce has given a big boost to the demand
for time-saving equipments like washing machines, vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens and
precooked foods. As women are coming out of homes, better dresses, cosmetics and health
gyms are required. With double-income families on the rise, fi rms dealing with leisure-time
activities, holiday packages and travel have received a boost.
<p>3. Cultural factors: India is a land of rich cultural heritage. Its culture is rich and diverse. Mar-
keters and advertisers take full advantage of knowing the buying season in different parts of
the country. During Deepavali, Hindus buy new clothes, household articles and exchange gifts.
Muslims do the same on the occasion of Eid while Christians do the same around Christmas.
The cultural ethos provides innumerable themes for promoting sales. India is a vast country,
where 20 languages are spoken, several religions and varied cultures and sub-cultures coexist.
For example, in Punjab, there is a Punjabi culture and within is the Sikh sub-culture. Karnataka
has a Kannad culture and then its district Coorg has its own sub-culture.
<p>4. Political factors: In India, it was the political will of the government that led to liberalisation,
privatisation and globalisation in 1991. The infl ux of foreign capital, setting up of manufacturing
bases and joint ventures all sprung up from then onwards. Changes in the cash reserve ratio,
taxation rates and duties are the political factors that have a major impact on business.
<p>5. Legal factors: The Supreme Court&rsquo;s directives have made car manufactures change the emission
standards to Euro II. Diesel buses are on their way out in Delhi for the same reason. Ignoring
the law of the lands can be detrimental to the interests of the fi rms operating in the country.
<p>6. Macroeconomic factors: The interest rates, taxes and duties and the balance of payment situation
between the home country and the country the fi rm wants to do business with and foreign
currency rate fl uctuations have a major impact on business and they must be well understood
by the fi rm.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management498
<p>7. Technology factors: In the past decade, information technology, telecom, biotechnology and
genetic engineering have revolutionised the business scene in the world as also in India.
<p>8. Global factors: The breaking of the Berlin wall and the reunifi cation of Germany, the break up of
the USSR, the recent attacks on the World Trade Tower in the New York and on the Indian Parlia-
ment and the liberation of Afghanistan have affected business worldwide and most countries
are trying to recover lost ground. On the brighter side, developments in the area of medicine,
agriculture and cloning have helped the world in taking giant strides towards a better future
for its children. The following are the major elements in a globalised economy:
<p> The world is becoming smaller due to reduced travel time and faster communications
through the internet.
<p> Strong trade zones like the European Union (EU), the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) and the Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
<p> Market economy in Russia.
The rise of multinational and transnational fi rms.
International strategic alliances.
The growth of global brands in foods like Kellogg&rsquo;s.
<p>COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
<p>It is important to analyse the competitive business environment with the help of Michael Porter&rsquo;s
Five-force Model (Figure 21.1).
<p>Figure 21.1 Competitive Analysis Model
<p>Rivalry Among the Existing Players
<p>The most important factor must deal with the existing competition, which over the past decade has
increased several fold. In India, marketers enjoyed a virtual oligopoly for most products till the epoch-
making year 1991, when the Government of India opened up the country&rsquo;s economy to foreign players.
The severity of competition is manifest in the innovations in the marketing mix factors by most fi rms. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 499
<p>Foreign players have brought with them the latest technology, well-known brands and management
skills. And yet they lack basic information about Indian buyers, their culture and mindsets. Indian fi rms
can therefore gauge this intrinsic weakness in the foreign players and gain advantage over them.
<p>Bargaining Power of Suppliers
<p>The suppliers of a fi rm belong to one of the following types:
<p> When there are several suppliers of undifferentiated products and a few buyer fi rms. A case
in point would be suppliers of nuts and bolts. In such cases, the buyers have the bargaining
power and the large-volume buyer gets the better price as quantity discount.
<p> When the suppliers are limited and there are several buyers, the bargaining power shifts to the
suppliers as then the suppliers can pick and choose their buyers on the basis of their purchase
value, proximity and adherence to payment schedules.
<p> When the suppliers may be limited but they are making unique products for a particular fi rm,
like car seat manufacturers. In such cases, the buyers have the power to the extent that the
supplier has to conform to the standards and delivery norms. As there are no other buyers for
the product they can acquire bargaining power by cornering the fi rm into a tight supply position
and the fi rm will accept any term of business as long as it can keep its production going.
<p> When the supplier is a part of the fi rm&rsquo;s own group, as then the bargaining power is decided
by the head of the group who has to have profi t distribution among the various members of
the group.
<p>Bargaining Power of the Buyers of the Firm
<p>The customer gets his power to bargain when there are several fi rms supplying the same product
and the customer gets his choice of buying from any one of the sellers, unless brand preference comes
into play.
<p>Threat of New Entrants
<p>When the product demand is in the growth stage of the product life cycle (PLC) and the entry barriers
are few, like high investment costs or government restrictions, then newcomers fi nd it diffi cult to start
business in that area and in that product.
<p>Threats of Substitute Product
<p>For paint manufacturers, lime paint (chuna), wallpaper, cement and wood panelling are the substitute
competitive products.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management500
<p>It is useful to understand the internal strengths and weaknesses of a company, as discussed next.
The following give a good balance of the different areas required for planning strategies in a
<p>fi rm:
<p>1. Critical success factors.
2. Value chain analysis.
3. Core processes and systems.
4. Balance scorecard
5. Qualitative analysis.
6. Quantitative analysis.
7. Activity-based cost analysis.
<p>CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
<p>These are the factors, which govern the success of the fi rm. They are derived from the following:
<p>1. Industry factors, whether it is growing, if yes, at what rate.
2. Its position in the market life cycle.
3. The general business environment factors.
4. Technology updates.
5. Competition.
<p>For a car service centre, the following would be the critical success factors:
<p> 1. Population of vehicles in the area.
2. Growth rate of vehicle population.
3. Is the product just being introduced?
4. Demography of the area.
5. Quality of service being provided.
6. Service equipments at the service centre.
7. Number of trained servicemen.
8. Location of the service centre. Does it have easy ingress and egress?
9. Parking facilities.
10. Service timings, 24 hours or less?
<p>The critical success factors of a fi rm can be analysed similarly.
<p>VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS
<p>Michael Porter, the management guru, has structured a method of analysing the functional areas of
a fi rm. The functions can be divided in two major blocks&mdash;the staff/support functions and the line/
primary functions. The activities/functions are within the fi rm, which provide value to the customer.
Its graphic representation is given in Figure 21.2.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 501
<p>Figure 21.2 Analysing Firms for Adding Value to them
<p>Support activities&mdash;HRD, technology,
fi nance, infrastructure, MIS
<p>Suppliers Line activities&mdash;inbound logistics,
operations, marketing, service,
<p>outbound logistics
<p> Customers
<p>Inbound logistics cover the movement of materials from the suppliers to the fi rm, cost of the move-
ment and timely supplies. Operations deal with productivity as compared to competition, production
control and automation in production and factory layout. Marketing covers market research,
advertising and promotion, distribution channels, brand equity and the product&rsquo;s place in the Boston
Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix and in the PLC. Service covers the guarantee service, other outside
guarantee service and handling of complaints.
<p>Outbound logistics covers the movement of fi nished goods from the fi rm&rsquo;s warehouse to the cus-
tomer&rsquo;s place. The analyses must be done keeping the customer&rsquo;s viewpoint in mind. For instance it
would be appropriate for a fi rm to know if its new fi nance manager has a customer-oriented approach
or not. The main fl aw in this study is that while individual functions are probed there is no investiga-
tion of the inter-relationships of the functions.
<p>Task for Students
What activities in the value chain would be the focus for change if a CEO of a manufacturing fi rm
decides to dramatically improve the delivery time of the fi rm&rsquo;s products?
<p>(The answer to this would be purchasing, fi nance, logistics, both inward and outward, manu-
facturing, services and may be personnel or HRM.)
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>CORE PROCESS AND SYSTEMS
<p>In order to reduce the fault associated with the value chain analysis, cross-functional teams or groups
are formed, which are based on the main or core processes of the fi rm. The diagram for core process
analysis is shown in Figure 21.3.
<p>Resources&mdash;human, capital and information&mdash;are brought by the fi rm from the outside. Out of the
three core processes, product development consists of market research for selecting the product, getting
the technology for manufacturing the same, either through research and development (R&amp;D) or by
buying it from other sources. The product design goes from R&amp;D to process engineering before it is
frozen and given to the manufacturing department.
<p>Demand management is the second core process, which includes the marketing&ndash;distribution
network, advertising, promotion and personal selling; all that goes into obtaining the purchase order
from the customer.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management502
<p>Order fulfi lment, the third core process, starts with getting raw materials from the suppliers, in-
bound logistics, raw material storage, manufacturing, fi nished goods storage, outbound logistics up
to the customer&rsquo;s premises. Maintaining low current assets level with &lsquo;just in time&rsquo; supplies is part
of this process.
<p>The study of core processes tries to look at cross-functional areas and hence avoids the pitfall of
missing the interaction between the various management functions.
<p>BALANCE SCORECARD
<p>To understand the holistic picture of a fi rm it is important to address four areas, which decide the
possibility of successful result in a fi rm. These are:
<p>1. Customer
2. Finance
3. Operations
4. Organisation
<p>Customer
<p>Firms work for customers, earn profi ts and grow because of them; fi rms need to know their market
share and brand value. A fi rm&rsquo;s position is determined by its competitive advantage over competition.
Firms gain competitive advantage by one or all of the following means:
<p>1. Achieving uniqueness over competition in product, price, placement and promotion or in
service; provide differentiation, which is liked and appreciated by the customer and which does not
jack up the price to an extent not acceptable to the customer. (Providing gold wiring inside a TV set in
place of copper wiring is an extreme example of total opportunity loss with product differentiation
<p>Figure 21.3 Core Process and Systems

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 503
<p>and high pricing.) Customers look for differentiated product as it gives them satisfaction and
an ego boost by making them owners of a product no one else possesses.
<p>2. Low cost of production, which is achieved by economies of scale of manufacture and by ex-
perience curve of the workers who improve their productivity over time and reduce production
rejections. Lowering the cost should never be at the cost of product quality because it could
become counterproductive and the fi rm could lose the entire market. With lower cost of
production, a fi rm generates cash, which can be utilised in the fi rm&rsquo;s growth or at times of
severe price competition in hitting at the competition.
<p>3. Quick response. A fi rm that is fi rst at meeting the requirements of the customers gains advantage
over fi rms that enter the fi eld later.
<p>Finance
<p>Finance is mainly used to determine the profi tability of a fi rm, its growth and the economic value it
is adding to itself. Economic value added (EVA) can be seen as the true indicator of a fi rm&rsquo;s fi nancial
health, rather than the usual return on investment (ROI).
<p>EVA can be arrived at in the following manner:
<p>EVA = PAT &ndash; (interest on debt + cost of equity capital)
<p>Where PAT is profi t after tax and cost of equity is calculated by taking average risk-adjusted rate of
return, which an equity or shareholder will get if he invests his money elsewhere.
<p>Firms can increase EVA by getting lower cost capital or by using less capital.
<p>Operations
<p>To analyse a fi rm&rsquo;s operations, the core processes, product development, demand management and
order fulfi lment processes must be looked into. How the fi rm can obtain competitive advantage from
these processes needs to be understood.
<p>Organisation
<p>Understanding the following areas of a fi rm is required for organisational analysis:
<p>1. Leadership based on leading by example, motivating personnel rather than ordering them
about.
<p>2. Motivation and energy level of the workmen.
3. The fi rm&rsquo;s ability to accept change when required.
4. Learning mode of the fi rm.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management504
<p>QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
<p>An organisation must be in a learning stage if it wants to maintain and increase its market share
and brand equity. Hence, organisational analysis is the most important area, which should be analysed
with care. Viewing the behaviour pattern of its people can help assess the organisational culture;
do they look up and about moving with a purpose or do they having a laid-back attitude towards
the fi rm and its results. Are all the members of the fi rm committed to the vision, mission, goals and
objectives of the fi rm? These soft areas of a fi rm are candid refl ections of the direction the fi rm is
going to take.
<p>The better-managed fi rms permeate a positive sense of urgency in the managers. They keep
comparing their own results with the results of their competitors. They keep raising the bar of excellence
to push themselves to better performance, even if they are the best in the business. Innovation and
creativity form the bedrock of their enthusiastic working energy, which separates the winners from
non-winners.
<p>QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
<p>It is done to understand the viability of the fi rm and its intrinsic strengths and weaknesses. A close
look at the profi t and loss statement and the fi rm&rsquo;s balance sheet for the past few years gives a clear
picture. The following ratios need to be seen:
<p>Liquidity Ratios
<p> Current ratio = current assets/current liabilities (availability of current assets to pay current
liability).
<p> Quick ratio = current assets &ndash; inventory/current liabilities (ability to pay current liabilities and
inventories through current assets).
<p> Cash ratio = cash and cash equivalents/current liabilities (availability of cash to pay current
liabilities).
<p> Inventory to net working capital = inventory/current assets &ndash; current liabilities (affect of changes
in inventories on playability from current assets).
<p>Profi tability Ratios
<p> Net profi t margin = net profi t after tax/net sales.
Gross profi t margin = sales &ndash; cost of goods/net sales.
Return on investment = net profi t after taxes/total assets (rate of return, management effi ciency
<p>indicator).
Return on equity = net profi t after taxes/shareholders equity.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 505
<p>Activity Ratios
Inventory turnover = net sales/inventory.
Assets turnover = sales/total assets.
Account receivable turnover = annual credit sales/account receivables.
Fixed asset turnover = sales/fi xed assets.
<p>Leverage Ratios
Debt equity ratio = total debts/shareholders equity.
Current liability to equity ratio = current liability/shareholders equity.
Earnings per share = total dividend declared/number of shares in the market with
<p>shareholders.
<p>Besides it is important to know the following:
<p>1. The fi rm&rsquo;s ability to raise additional capital.
2. Cost of capital.
3. Relationship with creditors and stockholders.
4. Dividend policy.
5. Match between resources and usage of funds.
<p>These analyses would certainly throw up improvement opportunities in the fi rm. Financial
comparisons should be made with the following:
<p> Firm&rsquo;s own historical fi gures.
Industry norms.
Besting the line, the benchmarks.
<p>Some Additional Financial Ratios
The following ratios give a fi rm insight regarding its operating effi ciency. The data is usually available
in the fi rm&rsquo;s balance sheet and from the stock exchange:
<p>1. Growth rate in sales is calculated by comparing the growth between year 1 and 2, year 2
and 3, year 3 and 4, and year 4 and 5 and then it is multiplied by a specifi c weight as shown
in Table 21.1.
<p>Table 21.1 Yearly Growth Rate and their Weightage
<p>Growth between years Weight
<p>1&ndash;2 1.0
2&ndash;3 1.2
3&ndash;4 1.4
4&ndash;5 1.6</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management506
<p>2. Growth rate in asset ratio: This gives an idea of the growth of the fi rm&rsquo;s corpus, the investment
made in assets to expand the fi rms operations.
<p>3. Working capital ratio: This is calculated as:
<p>Working capital ratio = inventory + receivables &ndash; payables/gross sales.
<p> It gives the fi rm&rsquo;s ability of managing short-term funds.
<p>4. Dividend ratio is calculated by dividing profi t after tax by the dividend; it gives the fi rms ability
to meet the expectations of the shareholders.
<p>5. Debt equity ratio: It is calculated as follows:
<p>Debt equity ratio = debentures + long-term loans/capital + reserves.
<p>ACTIVITY-BASED COST ANALYSIS
<p>For costing to be done, factors like cost of rework, cost of bottlenecks and delays are not taken into
account. The analyses must reveal the cost drivers of the fi rm. Usually the unit cost of production is cal-
culated by taking man-hours and material supplies into account. In activity-based costing, an engineer
accompanies the account, to focus on the details of workers activities during the work period.
<p>Task for Students
Students can ponder on the following question and give their comments:
<p>Should a fi rm&rsquo;s fi nancial strategy be strongly related to its overall corporate strategy? If yes,
then why?
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>In conclusion, it can be stated that the emphasis on the bottom line suggests that the fi rm&rsquo;s pro-
fi tability is the one factor that determines its long-term viability. Examining performances in the light
of customer value, fi nance, operations and organisational issues and perspectives provides a more
balanced and meaningful assessment. The general and competitive business environment have a
great infl uence on a fi rm&rsquo;s business. Given next are the environment factors and how their study can
be of help to fi rms.
<p>LINK BETWEEN CASH FLOW AND VALUE CHAIN
<p>Table 21.2 gives a clear picture of the link between cash fl ow of a fi rm and its value chain.
The cash fl ow and profi t picture comes from the following:
<p>1. Sales revenue.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>

<p>2. Operating expense
2. Operating profi t
3. Less taxes
4. Net operating profi t after taxes
5. Add depreciation
<p>The accounting picture can be seen from Table 21.3.

<p>After adding the depreciation, increase in working capital has to be reduced. And then expenses of
the following need to be considered:
<p>1. Warehouse equipment and transportation.
2. Production facilities and equipment.
3. Finished goods store equipment and transportation.
4. Distribution facilities sales expenses.
5. Service equipment, facilities and transportation.
<p>After reducing increase in working capital expenses, reduce the capital expenses to get the right
cash fl ow (see Figure 21.4).

<p>MARKET FOCUS
<p>In order to gain competitive advantage in a diversifi ed fi eld of operations with several players, it
is useful to concentrate on a specifi c market segment, which is best suited to the product and the
fi rm and which best accepts both the product and the fi rm. This way the fi rm can concentrate on
the communication channel, the language, the sales outlets best suited to the niche segment. This
would help in focused attention on the customer group and efforts would not get dissipated in the
large mass market. Product differentiation could be made suiting the narrow market needs in view.
<p>THE EXPERIENCE EFFECT
<p>When a fi rm has been making a product for a long time, the cost of unit manufacture tends to go down,
because the workers, having gained experience, make fewer mistakes. As a result, the rejection rate
goes down and unit cost of manufacture reduces considerably. A classical example is that of integrated
circuits (ICs). Initially, when the ICs were made they cost Rs 150&ndash;300. Today ICs can be purchased for
almost one-tenth the cost, simply because the rejection rate, which was almost 70 per cent earlier, has
gone down to less than 2 per cent over the years. The cycle goes on as shown in Figure 21.5:

<p>International Marketing Audit 509
<p>Before planning strategies, the internal strengths of the fi rm must be identifi ed. This can be done
by locating the critical success factors, value chain framework, core processes and systems; how the
various activities get refl ected on the profi t of the fi rm and how these provide value to external and
internal customers of the fi rm. Ratio analysis gives an idea of the fi nancial strengths of the fi rm, in-
cluding the concepts of EVA and Activity Based Cost Accounting (ABC). Qualitative analysis focuses
on the soft numbers like motivation level of the workers of the fi rm. The balance scorecard gives the
fi nancial, operational, marketing and organisational perspective of the fi rm&rsquo;s strengths and weak-
nesses. The fi rm&rsquo;s strategies could evolve from these studies.
<p>There are four main components of the audit as given next and are discussed in some detail for
ease of the reader&rsquo;s understanding:
<p>1. Marketing concepts
2. Behaviour concepts
3. Financial analysis
4. Balance sheet
<p>MARKETING
<p>The marketing strengths of a fi rm are the most important single factor for its success. Firms selling the
entire produce at a reasonable profi t, increasing sales of the same product portfolio, selling at a higher
price or successfully developing new products and selling them too profi tably would not face serious
problems. In evaluating the marketing strengths of a fi rm, the following areas are examined:
<p>Marketing Environment
<p>Markets, customers, brand equity, competition levels, economic trends, money supply position in the
market, legal issues, social developments and problems besetting the market and their causes.
<p>Marketing Action
<p>Products, pricing, distribution channels, advertising and promotion, personal selling, publicity.
The questions to be asked during an audit are summarised next:
<p>1. Customer&rsquo;s primary and secondary levels of satisfaction derived from the product; the idea
of the product as sold by the fi rm and the customers viewpoint about what product he is
purchasing.
<p>2. Environmental issues shaping the markets, competition and customers.
3. Firm&rsquo;s special skills as compared to the competition in marketing.
4. Marketing problems and opportunities the fi rm is facing today and may have to face in the
<p>future.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES
<p>In the dynamics of the host country&rsquo;s economics, fi rms must understand that the changing conditions
will make some markets more amenable than the others. Firms need to keep constant vigil in the
following areas:
<p>Law and Politics
<p>Government regulations can change product emphasis in the market; a recent example being the
stopping of sales of cars not conforming to the Euro emission norms. Other examples are the Gov-
ernment of India&rsquo;s disinvestments in some prominent fi rms, their voluntary retirement scheme (VRS),
price regulation of some commodities and, at times, deregulation of prices. These affect the business
of some fi rm or the other.
<p>Competition
<p>Competitive action needs continuous attention, especially if the market is an oligopoly one. Remaining
proactive on competitive product launches, new pricing, advertising and promotion would help the
fi rm in retaining its market share and even in increasing it.
<p>Suppliers
<p>Oligopoly supply fi rms tend to have the edge and they keep changing the prices (always to the higher
side) and other terms of business to their advantage. Firms, which have diversifi ed vertically, are at a
distinct advantage over others. It is therefore necessary for fi rms to keep a constant vigil on the supply
scene and always have more than one supplier for vital raw materials.
<p>Demographics
<p>Population composition is changing; there is a large teenage group, a large population of senior citizens
and migration of workers from villages to towns is a continuous phenomenon. All these factors pre-
sent business opportunities.
<p>Alternate Products
<p>These are available with better technology (electric shavers became popular for a while in the
1970s&ndash;80s); lower air fare prompt train travellers to travel by air.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 511
<p>Product&rsquo;s Location
<p>Understanding the product&rsquo;s location in the life cycle is important to understand the behaviour of
competitors who could be market leaders or market laggards. Firms have their own priorities with
regard to placing the product in a particular segment. Competitive information can lead the fi rm to
take a vigilant proactive decision in terms of its own product&rsquo;s business plan.
<p>Understanding the Consumer
<p>The consumer&rsquo;s needs, their buying patterns and habits, purchase decision triggers and the answers to
the fi ve Ws and one H&mdash;what they buy, why they buy, where they buy it from, when they buy, which
price they buy at and, fi nally, how they buy&mdash;is required. In normal circumstances, when the fi rm is
making a profi t and selling its entire produce, these questions become irrelevant. It is only when new
technology competitive product swamp the market, the fi rm does not know what hit it. Maslow&rsquo;s
hierarchy of needs and the Freudian theory of desires must be addressed to plan market policies.
A car is just not a means of transportation alone; it could refl ect the owner&rsquo;s status. A Mercedes
is bought more as a status symbol than for any other purpose. Firms do better if they understand
consumer behaviour in the market segments selected for their product.
<p>MARKET SEGMENTATION
<p>In the fi rst half of the twentieth century, the stress of fi rms used to be on production and whatever
was produced was sold. Competition was either not there or it was just not enough, with market for
all the players in the fi eld. With severe competition from international players, each selling multiple
brands and models, it would be futile for fi rms to sell in the mass market. The segment variety needs
different selling techniques, advertising messages and what works for one segment may not work
for the other. Product, price, promotion and placement all need different strategies for different seg-
ments. Segmentation is done on the following lines (Table 21.4).
<p>Strategic audit should trace the fi rm&rsquo;s growth and standing in the market place, which can be done
on the following parameters:
<p>Market Growth
<p> Same product increased sales through penetrating prices and increased efforts of the marketing
team.
<p> Same product sales increase in extension of geographic areas.
New or improved products in the same geographic area.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management512
<p>Acquisitions
<p>This involves investments of available funds of cash-rich fi rms in products or business diversifi cation
by acquiring other fi rms/business. Diversifi cations can be vertical or horizontal depending on whether
the fi rm has bought into its supplier or a product with which it has some synergy.
<p>Distribution Channels
<p>The ability of selection of the type of distribution network as also the actual dealers of the product to
cover the geographic segments is of vital importance for the success of the fi rm, especially for con-
sumer goods. It is the last link in the chain connecting the manufacturer to the consumer and the only
one which gets the buyers money in exchange of goods supplied.
<p>Pricing Policy
<p>Pricing policy is governed by the following considerations:
<p>ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
<p>Does the price change affect the product demand or not; the fi rm if they are marketing in multiple
segments must be fully aware of the demand changes in each segment on variation of price.

<p>International Marketing Audit 513
<p>GOVERNMENT&rsquo;S PRICE REGULATIONS
<p>In some products, the government has its own price mechanism, especially in food and drugs, and
fi rms must take this into consideration while fi xing the price.
<p>COMPETITORS
<p>Price becomes a function of competitive pricing, unless the fi rm can claim a higher price based on
their better brand equity.
<p>PRICING AND PROMOTIONS
<p>Short-term extra benefi ts are given to customers, which reduce the profi ts for the fi rm, but gain
additional market share. Such increases are mostly short-lived as they invite competitive reaction
nullifying the increase in the market share. At times the commission given to the channel members
change as the fi rm expects the channel members to pass on the benefi ts to the customers, putting a
smokescreen before competitors, giving the impression that they are not involved in any price war
on their own.
<p>PRICE AND QUALITY
<p>For premium-quality goods, high prices can be kept with high-brand equity, for low-quality goods
keeping high prices could be the means of getting quick profi ts before competition catches on. Keeping
low prices of high-quality products would mean generic product, high growth market and fi rms
wanting to improve its market share. Low quality low price would be for bargains and discounts
often times to unload extra inventory.
<p>PRODUCT STRATEGY
<p>It should take the product&rsquo;s brand equity, stage of its life cycle, competitive products, production
capacity/or product availability (heavy advertising and promotion will fall fl at if the product is not
available, unless the fi rm is trying to create artifi cial scarcity to increase demand).
<p>ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION
<p>Creating product awareness, leading to interest in owning it can be generated through intelligent use
of advertising, which does not oversell the product and remains in the realm of plausibility. Besides,
personal selling, publicity and promotion have defi nite roles to play in market communications. The
audit judges the effi cacy of these communications with the market segment.</p>

<p>International Marketing Management514
<p>ORGANISATIONAL BEHAVIOUR IN INTERNATIONAL
MANAGEMENT
<p>In a fi rm people work, individually, in teams and there is interaction between people, which is both
sideways and two ways vertical. Instructions from one side, reports from the other and overlap of
authority and work jurisdiction create confl icts, which if not nipped in the bud become gigantic
problems for the management of the fi rm. Hence, organisational behaviour has assumed great
importance in the success of a fi rm and it needs separate study, which is undertaken in the follow-
ing manner:
<p>Manager, Supervisor and Worker
<p>Individual behaviour depends on the person&rsquo;s education, knowledge base, skills, experience relevant
to his present situation in the fi rm, family background, family life and any negative history (say, of
violence).
<p>Energy and Motivation Levels
<p>Extra money, perquisites, promotions, better working conditions, good health, growth prospects are
the motivating factors, while the opposites are the factors that sap energy. Understanding the trigger
points of what really motivates an employee helps in proper alignment of these factors. For example,
a supervisor may be better motivated if instead of getting an extra Rs 2,000 he is given a company
motorcycle. The strategic audit should look from the point of view of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of human
needs and the correct motivation points will emerge on their own.
<p>Attitudes towards the Firm and Each Other
<p>People perceive events, actions and even ideas differently, depending on their own mindset of the
moment. Employees&rsquo; biases can be the eye-openers for the management, which can help in team
formations, identifying the lead players, motivators and de-motivators.
<p>Team Work
<p>As teams are formed, they go through the storming process where individual expectations, frustrations
and strong beliefs are brought out in the open. Later on, the normalising process takes place when
the team starts performing. First, the team is just a group of people; what gels them into a team is the
common goal, the unitary direction they all need to take, even while performing multifarious tasks
connected with their goal. The problems in group work arise due to the following reasons, which
must be considered during the audit:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Audit 515
<p> In teams, even intelligent people, experts, tend to take the easy way out to remain non-
controversial as they believe that accolades or blame would all be shared by the team.
<p> At times, individuals by habit or because they have an axe to grind, dominate the team and get
the decisions based on their plans.
<p> Team members tend to shy away from voicing opinion to show solidarity with what the
management has created as an elite team.
<p>Team Controls
<p>There are power groups within teams, which dominate it; in order to resolve this issue the fi rm has
to consider the following:
<p> The team leader may plan a reward and punishment system for its members.
Team can be controlled by the leader&rsquo;s charisma, his work style, his sense of fairness, his
<p>far-sightedness and his tolerance level for mediocrity.
Teams can be controlled by thorough planning where each task is well defi ned and assigned
<p>to the person capable of performing it even with a stretch.
<p>FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
<p>The audit must take into account the fact that fi nancial analysis is the starting point of the audit, as
also of the management&rsquo;s decision-making process. Considering the entire picture is a massive task;
the audit should take only the most relevant fi gures, accept the limitations of the study and then only
give the recommendations.
<p>Income and Balance Sheet
<p>The balance sheet is the mirror image of the fi rm as it refl ects its strengths and weaknesses, at a given
point of time, usually at the end of the fi nancial year of the fi rm, which is 31 March for most Indian
fi rms. From the audit viewpoint, monthly trial balance, which may even be unaudited by the fi rm&rsquo;s
statutory auditors, would suffi ce. The balance sheet gives the fi rms resources, its debt and equity base,
its assets and liabilities. It tells about the fi nancial health of the fi rm. The audit could defi ne and also
design the resource needs of the fi rm and its justifi able allocation.
<p>Business Audit Checklist
<p>The checklist covers the essential points of any business plan or strategic audit. All the points are not
relevant for every fi rm. Certain points are for start-up fi rms, others for on-going fi rms. Certain points
are for service industries as compared to product fi rms. There is a separate list for fi rms offering
equity to the market.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management516
<p>The checklist would be found useful in the following areas:
<p>1. Preparing a comprehensive business plan by presenting the required relevant information on
the format as per the checklist.
<p>2. As a questionnaire while interviewing the fi rm&rsquo;s employees to gather information to prepare
documents needed for the marketing audit.
<p>3. For evaluating the business plan or the fi rm&rsquo;s strategies as it provides specifi c points for
evaluation. It is not required that the checklist format be adhered to completely but the evaluators
would fi nd it appropriate to stick to the checklist to the extent possible.

Manufacturing
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Globalisation of markets have affected the international marketing scenario to such an extent that
outsourcing manufacturing to third countries has become commonplace as companies locate the most
advantageous manufacturing place to take full advantage of location facilities like low-cost labour,
availability of materials, skilled manpower and transportation facilities. This chapter recognises the
importance of outsourcing and helps students learn the fi ner points in this regard.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management522
<p>INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS AND CONTROLS
<p>Organising international business can be achieved in many ways. The company could own
the production and yet it could be either in the home country or in the host country. If the
production base is in the home country, then international business is conducted by exporting
<p>goods to the host country. At the next level, the company can buy equity shares in a running company
in the host country, which could be a wholly-owned subsidiary or partially-owned unit or a joint ven-
ture. There can be equity-based arrangements like giving manufacturing license to the host country&rsquo;s
company, offering franchise operations or just having management contracts or at times turnkey
operations as shown in Table 22.1.
<p>Table 22.1 Equity Based International Operations
<p>Production at Home country Host country
<p>Exporting Wholly-owned operations
Partially-owned with the balance widely held
Joint ventures
Equity alliances
<p>Non-equity based arrangements in the host country are as shown in Table 22.2.
<p>Table 22.2 Non-Equity Based International Operations
<p>Non-equity based arrangements Licensing
Franchising
Management contracts
Turnkey operations
<p>Companies like MacDonald&rsquo;s have franchise operations within their home country (USA) and have
used the same method in their overseas ventures as well. At other times, companies fi nd it cheaper
to get another company to handle their operations, especially if the operations are on a low scale and
the franchisee company has excess capacity in production and manpower. Companies use strategic
alliances to fulfi l their international objectives.
<p>INTERNATIONAL OBJECTIVES
<p>A company&rsquo;s international objectives are:
<p>1. Increase in sales volumes through geographic expansion.
2. Acquiring new resources.
3. Diversifi cation, both vertical and horizontal.
4. Reducing the risk of competitive actions.
<p>Each company has its core competencies and at times some products do not fi t in the company&rsquo;s
strategic plans. Such products can be given out through licensing to others, both in the home country </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Collaborations, Controls and Global Manufacturing 523
<p>and outside. Companies may fi nd the demand in one country not enough to justify its entry as other
companies are also trying to get in there. Siemens of Germany and GEC of England joined hands to
form GPT to operate in countries like India. Vertical integration helps in cost savings, while it needs
to have resources and fi nances to manage the complete value chain. However, these joint ventures may
become diffi cult if the host country&rsquo;s government has placed legal entry barriers for the company. Some
countries may have problems with foreign operating companies&rsquo; repatriation of profi ts earned in the
host country. If legally permitted, the collaborations can gain competitive advantage because of their
size, economies of scale, technology, brand equity and better control of channels of distribution.
<p>COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS
<p>The collaboration types depend on the company&rsquo;s outlay allotted to its foreign operations and therefore
there are trade-offs needed in some cases. Licensing would need a lower foreign resource commit-
ment than a joint venture. If the level of competition is low, it would give greater freedom for the choice
of entry base in international business. If the home country offi ce of the company handles the affairs,
it would amount to a greater degree of control and no profi t allocation to the foreign unit.
<p>Licensing agreements give rights to the licensees for a given period against payment of royalty to
the licensor by the licensee. Patents, inventions, processes of manufacture are provided through license
agreements. Besides the licensee has the copyrights to intellectual property like literary, musical or
graphic designs. The licensee has access to methods, procedures and systems of the licensor. This helps
the company to enter a market quickly at lower costs. Licensing agreements can have provisions for
restricting the licensee on markets including exports, exclusivity of license, production value limits
and maintenance of quality standards. There can be restrictions imposed by the governments of the
licensor&rsquo;s home country and the licensee&rsquo;s home country. The level of competition can be the deciding
factor too. In high-technology products, a company has to assess the possibility of the host country&rsquo;s
company&rsquo;s ability to absorb the technology.
<p>Franchise agreement differs as they provide for the use of trademarks of the licensor and continued
update of technology and other assets. The franchisers try to ensure standardised products besides
management systems. However, at times, these do not get the right reception in the host country.
MacDonald&rsquo;s had to eschew the beef product line in India and redesign some of their products with
a local fl avour.
<p>Management contracts are made when the host-country company is not able to manage effi ciently
and invites a foreign company to takeover its management. Turnkey operations are usually made by
construction fi rms like the Japanese company that took up building of the bridge on River Yamuna
in Delhi.
<p>Joint ventures need not be equal equity partnerships. It could be formed with two companies from
the same country joining hands to form a joint venture to operate in another country. Long ago ESSO
and Mobil formed a joint venture known Standard Vacuum Oil Company to operate in India and
elsewhere. Foreign companies can join hands with a local company to enter the country. For instance,
Daewoo joined hands with the DCM Group to set up Daewoo Motors. Before that DCM had a joint
venture with the Toyota Motor Company. Some companies just take minority shareholding in the
host-country company to get a foothold in the host country for testing the markets before embarking
on full-fl edged operations.
<p>Joint ventures are not always successful; as the partners do not give equal importance to the
venture and have different objectives for it. At times they do not provide the venture with the required </p>

<p>resources or directions and try to extract maximum benefi ts even when the fi nances do not allow it.
Cultural differences are hindrances in the smooth running of joint ventures. Only with experience
can joint venture partners learn to evolve operating methods and an organisational culture accept-
able to both partners.
<p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONTROLS
<p>The major decisions that a company going overseas has to take are:
<p>1. Locations where decisions are to be made.
2. Methods of gaining global competitive advantage.
3. Reporting systems between home offi ce and fi eld offi ces in the host countries.
<p>Controls on foreign offi ces are diffi cult due to the distance involved between them and the home
offi ce as communication and travel is expensive and time consuming. When a company deals with
several countries, it has to understand the diversities of culture, economic levels and consumer
behaviour between them. Besides this, the company may face several other problems in the host
country. The host country&rsquo;s government formulates laws that support the local business. There are
stockholders from the host country that have their own agenda. The business environment keeps
changing rather rapidly in host countries for the company to be able to formulate a standard long-
term plan. However, most companies operating at an international level use the following control
process in their operations:
<p>1. Country-specifi c organisational structure.
2. Levels of decision-making.
3. Planning to include the control points and reporting systems.
4. Special country-specifi c areas.
<p>Controls are made by comparing the actual situations with the pre-planned objectives on areas like
sales, increases, higher mark-ups and amortising fi xed costs on larger volumes. Controls can be kept
on resource acquisitions as the direct costs are reduced, tax advantages are gained and complementary
resources are acquired too. Objectives like diversifi cation of markets and products can be seen from
the control viewpoint. Objectives like reducing competitive strengths are achieved by obtaining the
much-needed resources and depriving the competition of the same.
<p>A company&rsquo;s resources like cash fl ow needs for the present and in the future need to be under-
stood and compared for controlling the same. Profi t and dividend plans, availability of capital and
strength for borrowing additional capital are areas of study and control.
<p>Companies have to keep assessing their employees&rsquo; general and product-specifi c skills, special
abilities, cross-functional operational ability, attitude to foreign operations, besides their ability for
obtaining additional resources when needed and utilisation of manufacturing capacity.
<p>A company has to look for the adaptations needed in products for the international markets,
primary and secondary demands, full utilisation of capacity, cost reduction through economies of
scale and the transport situation.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Collaborations, Controls and Global Manufacturing 525
<p>A company has to understand the business environment and its effect on areas like supply and
costs in foreign trade demand patterns and cycles, market share of the competitors and the attitude
of the society about its products.
<p>A company has to understand the local tax laws, receivables and payables situation, that is, the credit
to be allowed to buyers and the credit being given by the suppliers. Besides, the company should know
if the buyers or the suppliers need to be fi nanced. The host-country government may also have their
plans for fund usage, like a specifi c percentage must be spent on research and development (R&amp;D).
<p>A company should get the market data at a reasonable cost besides they should know the pre-
valent distribution system for the product. It is useful to know the level of competition and the com-
petitors&rsquo; market shares. It is good to know if there are governmental rules that fi x the prices or the cost
of advertising efforts. A company should know about the stability of the government and economic
strength of the host country. They should know the country&rsquo;s attitude towards international companies
and their products.
<p>A company has to give its priorities to value added services like their geographic location, market
geographic locations, its level of involvement in the host-country operations, global or multi-domestic
marketing, global moves and strategies, strategies on products and services for the specifi c market
and priorities for these from among the possible alternatives.
<p>The control points start with setting targets on sales, production and on costs and then comparing
the actual fi gures with target fi gures. The control report should depict clearly the deviations in actual
from the objectives. Companies must adhere to their own policies or follow the host country&rsquo;s gov-
ernmental laws on environment protection in their processes and products. Wherever possible, requisite
corrective steps should be built in, in the control reports. Companies should maintain contingency
plans for unknown eventualities.
<p>GLOBAL MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE ORGANISATIONS
<p>It must be understood that with every product there is some service involved and with every service
there is a product. The ratio of product is higher in consumer durables and fast moving consumer
goods (FMCG); they usually need large manufacturing facilities and are capital intensive. The output
in product groups can be measured and quality checks are easy to organise. Conversely, the services
are more intangible and perishable. (You cannot carry the airplane seat with you on disembarking.
An empty seat on a plane loses its fare and hence perishes.) The output of service cannot be placed
under inventory. The customers are in close touch with the service provider, while in products the
customer comes in contact only with the retailer. Service as a product is usually labour-intensive and
its quality checks are diffi cult.
<p>Multinational corporations (MNCs) have to decide about the location where the components would
be made, sub-assemblies arranged and where the fi nal assembly would take place, as these may not
be necessarily at one location. The decisions on these points are taken by taking the following into
consideration:
<p>1. Cost of labour and its effi ciency levels.
2. Cost of money supply.
3. Availability of raw material and their costs.
4. Infrastructure availability.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management526
<p>5. Transportation costs to the markets and from the raw material components and sub-assemblies
production areas.
<p>6. Trust and dependability of the supplier group&mdash;company&rsquo;s own or outsourced.
7. Level of awareness of quality requirements.
8. Flexibility of activities.
9. Level of innovative activities.
<p>Production effi ciency would help reduce the cost of products, as it would cut down the rejection
rate and the cost of rework. Raw material availability would help in saving time in their search as well
as reduce transportation time. Without proper infrastructure, the company would be handicapped
in communications with the home country, with the suppliers, buyers, bankers and with the other
stakeholders. Trust and dependability helps in building long-term associations with the host-country
organisation for mutual benefi t. As the company sells on its brand name, which is singly characterised
by the product and its service quality, it is imperative that the host-country unit understands and
remains focused on the company&rsquo;s quality requirements. As the market is not a static entity, the
manufacturing unit must be fl exible enough to react quickly to the demand from the market with as
little lead time as possible. While the company may depend on its home country R&amp;D, it is an asset
if the host unit is also prepared to modify the product to suit the market.
<p>Once the country has been selected, it becomes necessary to select a location along with the pro-
duction scale. It would call for an assessment of the market needs of the areas or even countries the
company wants to cater to, from the facility. The choice of process would follow once the size of
operations has been decided. Companies in USA have found outsourcing a viable option in case
of several products like shoes. Starting from Nike to Adidas, US fi rms are getting shoes made in Far
Eastern countries like Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and the Philippines. They are getting software
developed in countries like India. This brings the companies to the subject of vertical integration, where
either upstream or downstream products are added on to the manufacturing list. For instance, a car
maker can take up the making of car seats as well. The company can plan coordinating the activities
of its various R&amp;D activities that could be placed in the home country and some host countries as
well. The manufacturing processes can be made uniform based on the home country&rsquo;s facilities or
could be modifi ed in the host countries taking the level of manufacturing technology available there
into account. Companies can decide to have manufacturing only in the home country and exporting
products from there to the markets worldwide. They could opt for independent manufacturing bases
in different host countries, as per market needs and logistic support availability. They can plan both
global manufacturing as well as regional manufacturing to suit the market needs. Availability of
raw materials, low-cost skilled labour and low-cost fi nance are other factors that guide companies to
plan overseas production. Companies can shift manufacturing to countries where the technology is
available at a reasonable cost and/or the market is in close proximity. At times, the home-country
governments provide incentives to outside companies for setting up manufacturing bases in their
country to obtain technology, increase job potential and improve the country&rsquo;s gross national product
(GNP). If the company fi nds that the host-country manufacture is lower in cost as compared to home-
country manufacture, they could import from the host country to sell in the home country.
<p>A good example of such outsourcing can be seen from the British Raj in India when the raw ma-
terials from India like cotton, wool and iron ore were exported to the UK and after they got converted
into fi nished products they were imported to India, giving the entire profi t to the UK companies
that were engaged in the conversion process. India suffered due to its political handicap of being a
slave country.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Collaborations, Controls and Global Manufacturing 527
<p>Today, however, locating the manufacturing unit would depend on several factors, which are:
<p>1. Cost of transportation of raw materials, components and fi nished goods.
2. Import duties on components.
3. Import duties on fi nished goods.
4. Market proximity.
5. Economies of scale possible.
6. Risk of currency fl uctuations.
7. Availability of technology.
<p>The actual process of manufacture would depend on the levels of technology available and the
cost of labour in the host country. If the cost of labour is low then the manufacturing process can be
labour intensive and if the labour cost is high then it may be better to have lot of automated process
with, perhaps, robotics involved. Cost and availability of land, availability of essential infrastructure
like power, water, telecommunication, roads that are motorable and proximity to railhead, ports and
airfi eld are also factors to be considered. Manufacturing layout normally takes a standard pattern
that reduces backtracking of semi-fi nished goods and yet some of the considerations stated earlier
can cause changes in the same.
<p>A major issue in outsourcing remains the quality level of manufactured product in the host
country. While quality is usually determined by the company&rsquo;s norms, the actual implementation and
enforcement of quality standards have to be left to the host country units. Most companies assign their
trusted quality assurance persons to host-country operations to maintain uniform quality standards
with the home-country production. Companies have resorted to total quality management (TQM), a
concept that empowers workers to ensure maintenance of acceptable quality levels. As a process,
TQM is meant to arrange manufacturing with zero defects. This saves on reworking expenses, be-
sides improving the cycle of manufacture and enabling lower lead time for dispatches of fi nished
goods. The TQM process continuously improves the process of manufacture as the workers themselves
keep experimenting for making improvements happen. Zero-defects manufacture helps in lowering
the manufacturing costs as the rework time is reduced to zero. Companies may have to invest in
manufacturing equipments of higher technology that result in lowering defects and improving the
product quality. Manufacturing costs run into the costs of making plus the cost of defects, customer
returns of defective products and cost of repairs. With zero defects, the manufacturing costs have no
elements in it other than the cost of manufacture.
<p>Hence, it can be summarised that TQM remove defects through continuous improvements at all
levels of the organisation. Apart from manufacturing, TQM also covers purchasing, sales, human
resource management (HRM) and fi nance.
<p>Today the ISO 9000 certifi cation is essential for non-European companies wanting to do business
in Europe. The ISO series is about a company documenting their entire process and keeping records
at each stage of their operation to show interested persons that they are adhering to the process they
have adopted for their operations. The types of ISO certifi cation given are as follows:
<p>ISO 9001
<p>It is issued if the company has comprehensive and detailed standards for design, development, pro-
duction, installation and servicing.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management528
<p>ISO 9002
<p>It is issued for companies having standards on production and installation.
<p>ISO 9003
<p>It is issued to companies focusing on fi nal inspection of the products and testing.
<p>GLOBAL OUTSOURCING AND MANUFACTURING
Companies have several options like getting components from other countries and assembling them
in the home country for local consumption and for exports. Companies can arrange components in
a host country, assemble the product there, import them into the home country and export to other
countries as well, as given next:
<p>1. Outsourcing material, assembly in home country, host country/countries or both.
2. Manufacture of components, assembly in home country, host country/countries or both.
3. Product sales in home country, host countries/countries or both.
<p>Most companies prefer to use home country raw materials and components as it helps in avoiding
problems of distances, political problems, currency fl uctuation problems, tariff variations and problems
arising out of dealing with different languages. However, companies keep looking at global sourcing to
reduce costs and for improving the product quality. Finally, outsourcing should provide the company
with cost reduction, quality improvements, increased access to international state-of-the-art technology
and improvement in reliability and delivery process.
<p>According to the Ford Motor Company, they have an extensive global network for obtaining com-
ponents needed in the two manufacturing facilities they have in Europe. For example, some of the
components they get from the UK are clutch, ignition, oil pump, speedometer, battery, steering wheel,
fuel tank, glass and locks. The other locations they outsource the manufacture of components to are:
<p> 1. Austria: Tyres, radiators and heater hoses.
2. Belgium: Tyres, tubes, seat pads, brakes and trims.
3. Italy: Cylinder heads, carburettors, glass, lamps and defrost grills.
4. Canada: Glass and radio.
5. Japan: Starters, alternators, rollers and cone bearings and windscreen washer pumps.
6. Norway: Exhaust ranges and tyres.
7. Sweden: Hose clamps, cylinder bolts, exhaust pipes, pressings and hardware.
8. Denmark: Fan belts.
9. Switzerland: Under chassis coating, speedometers and gears.
10. Holland: Tyres, paint and hardware.
11. United States: EGR valves, wheel nuts, hydraulic tappets and glass.
12. Germany: Locks, pistons, front discs, distributors, weather strips, rocker arms, speedom-
<p>eters, fuel tanks, cylinder bolts, cylinder head gaskets, front-wheel knuckles, rear-wheel
spindles, transmission cases, clutch cases, steering columns, batteries and glass.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Collaborations, Controls and Global Manufacturing 529
<p>13. France: Alternators, cylinder heads, master cylinders, brakes, under-chassis coating, weather
strips, clutch release bearings, steering shafts and joints, seat pads and frames, transmission
cases, clutch cases, tyres, suspension bushes, ventilation units, heater hose clamps, sealers and
hardware.
<p>As can be seen, the company has, for certain critical components, arranged for more than one
source of supply, while they have just two production bases, both in Europe&mdash;Halewood, UK and
Saarlouis, Germany.
<p>Companies add foreign suppliers to the domestic ones for ensuring reliability of supplies. In some
cases, the technical expertise may be available only overseas along with capacity to supply the com-
ponents as per the company&rsquo;s requirements. Outsourcing overseas could allow the company to get
better quality components. Besides it could help in fi ghting competition from home suppliers&rsquo; base
from where other manufacturers also obtain their components. It helps in opening up the international
markets to the company. Moreover, if the competition is outsourcing their components, the company
should fi nd out the economic viability of doing so and then plan its own offshore sourcing.
<p>Companies have to take a stand on making the products or buying it for sale. At times, some com-
ponents could be made and some others could be bought out. Companies could go for vertical
integration and get into manufacturing of the downstream components. The other option is to just
buy them from outside suppliers. Outsourcing should be resorted to where the supplier has the
advantage of economies of scale, better technology, has a lower manufacturing cost structure or
incentives for higher levels of production. Components that are critical should be outsourced with
great care as it would bind the company to the source that could play truant by not supplying on time
and pressurising the company for better prices and cash payments. The quality management of the
suppliers need careful scrutiny and at times may need imparting training to the suppliers&rsquo; engineers
in proper testing methods and the value of TQM. When the suppliers can provide quality products,
constantly upgraded technological innovations and economies of scales translated into price reduc-
tions, the company can look for long-term relationship with such suppliers. At times, when such a
supplier has been found, the company would be tempted to vertically integrate the supplier in its own
ambit. Else, the company can opt for long-term agreements, cooperation in technology upgradation,
fi nance, manpower planning and management expertise for maintaining close contacts where the
supplier feels almost one with the company. In such a scenario, the company can even change the com-
ponents, their specifi cations and yet get the same at a low price, enabling the company to plan new
models at competitive prices. The value chain can in a way become an arm of the company.
<p>Companies have several options before them as they plan their purchase function. They can go in
for totally local purchase when the controls are easier, time for obtaining supplies shorter and price
negotiations can be conducted with relative ease, as the supplier is aware of the business ethos of the
country. The companies can plan small supply sizes with lower cash requirements. And the latest
&lsquo;just in time&rsquo; inventory management becomes possible.
<p>Next, the companies can selectively locate international component manufacturers, with the
necessary qualifi cations to become suppliers. It could start as a one-off purchase deal and ultimately
become a regular supply commitment from both the suppliers&rsquo; side and the company&rsquo;s side. Finally,
companies can plan global outsourcing strategies to obtain the benefi ts available in different part of
the world, like some country might have better technology, another may have low-cost labour and
yet another have easy availability of the required raw materials.
<p>Companies use a number of ways for getting overseas supplies, like involving the home offi ce
purchase department to do the job. They could use foreign subsidiaries or business units for selecting
the suppliers most suited for their operations. Some companies that have international offi ces use them </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management530
<p>for organising outsourcing in the countries they operate in. The most advanced companies use inter-
national outsourcing in an integrated manner for worldwide operations. These centralised operations
are most useful when the money value of purchase is high, the components are of strategic importance,
including the value of quality and if they have high technology inputs. The companies can plan to
obtain up to 70 per cent of their requirements from one source. The supply agreements can also be on
a long-term basis say of up to fi ve years. The purchase actions could be centralised at the home offi ce
for keeping direct control on vital purchases.
<p>INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND JIT
Just in time (JIT) inventory management calls for supplies to be made in time when required for use
and of good quality. Foreign sourcing becomes problematic when the companies are looking for JIT
supplies. Economies in transportation, distances and language and cultural differences are mainly
responsible for the problems. The JIT requirements comprise the following:
<p>1. Understanding of the shipment size and consequent shipment frequency.
2. The company&rsquo;s policy on inventory management should be clearly understood by the purchase
<p>people as inventory or current assets block the company&rsquo;s cash reserves.
3. Lead time required by the supplier for supply batches.
4. Rejection rate of supplies and quality management of the suppliers.
5. Means and methods of communication available with the supplier.
6. Number of suppliers for a particular component, whether sole or multiple suppliers.
7. Supplier&rsquo;s record of timely supplies.
8. Suppliers approach to sudden changes in supply schedules.
9. Availability of shipping lines, air cargos and their frequency.
<p>Uncertainties in shipment schedules cause inventory build-up increasing the costs. Ocean freight
costs much less than air cargo but depending on the time schedule either option can be used. The JIT
inventory management usually creates a one supply source situation, that commits to strict supply
plans and yet global supply base almost forces companies into keeping an alternate supply source
due to several imponderables associated with international suppliers.
<p>FREE TRADE ZONES
Free trade zones are promoted by certain governments where tariff payments can be delayed or
totally avoided. In these zones, storage and manufacturing can take place without payment of any
duty. Having a large inventory in these zones does not block money meant for paying the duties and
taxes. These could be industrial parks or distribution zones.
<p>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
<p>Companies operating internationally arrange their product development and new product launches
through their international R&amp;D facilities that may be spread across several countries. The R&amp;D and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Collaborations, Controls and Global Manufacturing 531
<p>manufacturing units may be in different countries and yet they have to keep interacting for getting
the right product as needed by the customers and that too at the lowest cost. Such designing of the
products gets the nearest possible fi t, as the demands and variety required by different countries can
be quite different from each other. National consumer tastes, preferences and sophistication needs
can be met only with research establishments that span across national boundaries.
<p>SUMMARY
<p>Production management is responsible for the conversion process that converts the raw materials and
components into saleable products. As expertise of manufacturing, availability of raw materials and
components and skilled labour for different products may be available in different countries, com-
panies have to take decisions regarding the location of their manufacturing units. Proximity of markets
and money supplies at low cost are major considerations in this regard, besides the host country&rsquo;s
government&rsquo;s laws and attitudes towards foreign companies operating in the country.
<p>Companies have to keep a strict vigil on the quality of products being manufactured in other coun-
tries. Outside manufacture can take place by having a joint venture with some local company. Having
TQM and meeting the ISO norms are methods of improving quality and maintaining the same as
per the customers&rsquo; requirements.
<p>Companies can start with home country manufacture and exports, followed by manufacturing
facilities in other countries that can operate in the multi-domestic mode with autonomy. When offshore
manufacture is widespread in several countries, then the company can create a global focus with a
regional emphasis on product designs for the markets of different countries. At times outsourcing
of component assembly can be done at two international locations to obviate the problem caused by
any mishap at one location. Transportation costs play an important role in deciding the location of
manufacturing units. The JIT inventory management in global outsourcing scenario becomes com-
plicated as lead time variations and transportation time can be the deciding factors. Worldwide R&amp;D
can help MNCs in promoting the right mix of manufacture in different countries that could be cater-
ing to the needs of a vast variety of costumers.
<p>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
<p>1. Discuss the impact of MNCs on local business.
2. Discuss how the decisions of MNCs in one country impact business in other countries.
3. Discuss the diffi culties encountered by MNCs because of differences in home and host country
<p>conditions.
4. Discuss FDIs and balance of payment and their impact on the home and host country&rsquo;s business.
5. Are countries affected by foreign control of key industries?
6. Capital induction by MNCs can become a bargaining power with the host country&rsquo;s government.
<p>Discuss.
7. What are the differences and similarities between domestic and international negotiations?</p>

<p>23 Understanding Case Studies
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Case studies are the ideal learning aids for the subject of international marketing. This chapter deals
with the methodology of handling case studies, followed by a selection of case studies that have been
used in the teaching of this subject by several senior faculty members.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Understanding Case Studies 533
<p>Case studies help students and the readers of the book to relate to the practical aspects of the
theories given in the book. In fact, students can analyse the information given, fi nd alternative
solutions, assess the best option and then give their recommendations on the cases. It would
<p>be the task of the teacher or the guide to steer the students to the right path enabling them to arrive
at the best recommendations. The following method is suggested for arriving at the recommenda-
tion stage:
<p> 1. Read the case cursorily in the fi rst stage.
2. Study any fi gures or tables provided in the case.
3. Analyse the fi gures.
4. Study the case in detail again.
5. Use the tools available for analysing the case.
6. Write down a rough report.
7. Discuss the rough report with your guide.
8. Make a fi nal report on the basis of the discussions.
<p>The fi nal report should have the following elements in it:
<p> 1. Title page.
2. Acknowledgements page, where you express your gratitude to those who helped you in the
<p>case analysis.
3. Table of contents with page numbers.
4. Executive summary of the recommendations on the case.
5. Brief information on the case.
6. Tools you are planning to use in the case study.
7. Case analysis.
8. Recommendations (with possible expected results, if possible) and conclusions.
9. Glossary of important words used.
10. Bibliography.
<p>Students must understand that while solving case studies, there is no absolutely right or wrong
answer. The areas to look for are the following:
<p> 1. The student has understood the case and its problem areas well.
2. The student is using the right tools in solving the case.
3. The student has analysed the fi gures and tables given in the case (if any).
4. The student has presented his recommendations in a forthright and unambiguous manner.
5. The recommendations need not be many, but they should be hard-hitting and direct.
6. The recommendations must arise out of the case analysis and the tools used. Any major
<p>deviation, which is not explicitly mentioned in the case, must be stated clearly with reasons
for the same.
<p>CASE STUDY 1: RAYCHEM CORPORATION USA
<p>Raychem is an American fi rm involved in the manufacture of chemicals. It has a strong research
and development (R&amp;D) department and a large product range. Managing the product portfolio </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management534
<p>is a major concern at Raychem. They have to keep a balance in product push in the market through
heavy inventories. Their products also demand in the market and market pull is created through
advertising.
<p>The corporate strategy is to grow at the rate of 25 per cent each year. The marketing plans are
as follows:
<p>1. Products: To meet customer needs.
2. Price: What the market can accept.
3. Placement: Worldwide.
4. Promotion: Well-trained staff.
<p>As the fi rm&rsquo;s goal is steep, 25 per cent growth per year, they have to go for aggressive marketing
and prompt and proper service. They have realised that even with these plus points, the target can
be achieved only when customers across the world know about them. They have been doing research
on a hit-and-miss basis. Some areas are well researched while others have been totally neglected. They
have created technological entry barriers for newcomers in their fi eld.
<p>They plan to have excellent direct mail programme as other media are too expensive for worldwide
exposure and not too effective either.
<p>In fi rms engaged in commercial products such as Raychem, image-building advertising is neces-
sary. It is important to conduct advertising research to understand how the consumers process the
information provided in the advertisement and how they perceive the advertisement. Information
is also needed to know about the attitudes of the consumers and any changes therein due to the
campaign. The research should make you aware of the consumers&rsquo; behaviour towards competitive
products. Advertising research is a part of marketing research, confi ned to development of advertising
plan, creative work, market segment and the best possible media, which would cater to the segment.
The research should increase the effectiveness and effi ciency of the advertising campaign. Data
collection is done from primary sources as also secondary, already available sources. In primary
data collection, it is important to select the sample correctly. The research steps are:
<p>1. Setting up goals for the research.
2. Finding out the sources of secondary information/data.
3. Analysing secondary data.
4. Planning sample for primary research.
5. Data collection.
6. Data analysis and report writing.
<p>Task for Students
Prepare an alternate plan for aggressive marketing and advertising to enable the fi rm to reach its
steep goal.

<p>Gillette&rsquo;s strategic marketing plan for success includes making a fi ve-year rolling plan, which is
reviewed three times a year and modifi ed as required. Every six months, sales forecast is made.
<p>Gillette&rsquo;s philosophy can be summarised as follows:
<p>1. Keep introducing new products and 50 per cent of their business must come from products,
which have been introduced less than fi ve years ago.
<p>2. Technical superiority in every product. Gillette considers competition as a spur for customer
retention.
<p>Gillette&rsquo;s game plan is as given next:
<p>1. Keep the user/customer at the centre of activities.
2. Provide improved products&mdash;gain increased net sales.
3. Have pricing options by improvement in products.
<p>Gillette considers the following as their key growth areas:
<p>1. Value addition in existing products.
2. Speedy launches of new products.
3. Distribution network.
4. Display and merchandising.
5. Advertising and promotion.
6. They keep a close watch on standard direct costs and post-marketing expenses, which can be
<p>considered controllable overheads.
7. Synergy for effi ciency and effectiveness.
8. Profi ts through information technology (IT) driven total quality management (TQM ) and
<p>people&rsquo;s involvement.
<p>Gillette has developed a marketing strategy for facing recession in the market. They view the
impact of recession on the different segments of the market as follows:
<p>1. Consumers: Their demand reduces for non-essential articles and they switch to value for money
products.
<p>2. Trade: They suffer from inventory blockage of non-essential products and they end up with
heavy stocks of a variety of products.</p>

<p>International Marketing Management536
<p>3. Firm: It loses customers as also trade/distribution channels who show little interest in the
products.
<p>Gillette&rsquo;s policy for marketing during recession is that of pause! They believe in operating in the
following manner:
<p>1. Basic marketing strategy does not change.
2. They organise better management of resources and plan tactical moves.
3. They provide value addition; when consumers downgrade, Gillette provides added value to
<p>the product; they reinforce the advertising messages; improve the product package.
4. They arrange new product launches to increase user share and also upgrade the users.
<p>The result so far has been that Gillette has grown even during recession periods.
<p>Task for Students
Is the fi rm justifi ed in upgrading their products and charging more when the customers are fi nding
it hard to pay their existing prices? Discuss their policy for success.

<p>CASE STUDY 3: HINDUSTAN ELECTRO-GRAPHITES
THE INDIAN INTERNATIONAL BRAND
<p>The Indian graphite industry is a Rs 7 billion industry, which has garnered around 10 per cent of the
world trade of the product. It is also an industry that has continued to grow even when the entire in-
dustry and business, both worldwide and in India, has been shrinking for the last decade. The graphite
electrode industry has its fortunes linked to that of secondary steel production through the electric
arc furnace (EAF) technology and other factors like the structure of domestic industry, electrode
production technology and costs, exports, accessibility to raw materials and customers. India beats
the developed countries of the world in terms of cost of production because of its lower fi xed costs,
labour and overheads.
<p>The Indian graphite electrode industry has only three major domestic players. Hindustan Electro-
Graphites (HEG) Ltd is a leading graphite electrode maker and also operates the single largest graphite
electrode plant in South Asia. Supporting a global perceptive, the fi rm has decided not to restrict itself
to the domestic market and it aims at achieving a respectable market share worldwide.
<p>The strength of HEG includes possession of sophisticated electrode manufacturing technology,
ISO 9002 certifi cation, competent workforce and management. It faces reduced risks of the busi-
ness cycle because of horizontal diversifi cations, deep fi nancial resources and related backward
diversifi cations.
<p>Its weaknesses include dependence on imported raw materials, high levels of inventory, poor cash
fl ow, stiff and bureaucratic organisational structure and weak R&amp;D.
<p>Intense competition, exchange rate fl uctuations, changing technology, high bargaining powers of
customers and suppliers are some of the threats facing HEG.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Understanding Case Studies 537
<p>The growing demand for graphite electrodes in fast developing countries, HEG&rsquo;s global experi-
ences and image and installed production base are some of its plus points.
<p>The Indian graphite electrode (GE) industry is concentrated as there are three major players in
India. Between them they share a Rs 700 crore market. The Jhunjhunwalas and the Bangurs share
the battleground. The Jhunjhunwalas own the country&rsquo;s largest GE factory HEG. The Bangur Group,
through its own fi rms Carbon Everfl ow Ltd (CEL) and GIL, are the biggest in the GE industry in India.
The total installed capacity of the three companies&mdash;HEG, GIL and CEL&mdash;is 54,000 tons. Hindustan
Electro-Graphites has a 40 per cent share and the other two have the balance.
<p>The biggest threat today is imports, which are eating into the market of the domestic players, as
imported GEs are available at much lower costs. This has happened after the rationalisation of duty
structure, which went against the domestic industry.
<p>The imports and exports of GE is given in Table 23.1.
<p>Table 23.1 Imports and Exports GE
<p>Year Imports in tons Exports in tons
<p>1993 475 11,148
1994 500 15,003
1995 3,080 17,001
1996 5,500 18,291
1997 4,000 21,000
<p>The dramatic increase in imports since 1994 was primarily because Chinese producers were dump-
ing their products in India at a low price of US$ 1,100 per ton, while the average price in the international
market was US$ 2,600 per ton. In 1997, dumping duty was imposed on China and there was a drop
in the total GE imported in the country in 1997.
<p>At present, the scenario can be described as being between the devil and the deep sea. At a time
when domestic players were fi ghting to create a strong base, infi ltration started. These foes are none
other than the mighty international players, while Indians are fi ghting for survival. The present
situation is not a happy one as the Indian players have been crying hoarse about international players
resorting to dumping practices in India while the government has not done anything about it. Duties
on imported electrodes have been reduced.
<p>The fact that the user industry, the steel industry, is doing reasonably well, does not ensure good
days for the GE industry. The main cause of its sufferings is the size of the GE industry. While the
government provides the steel industry concessions, the GE industry does not get any.
<p>Hindustan Electro-Graphites is the leading GE maker and it also operates the single largest
GE plant in South Asia. It is an ISO 9002 fi rm. The fi rm has its GE plant at Bhopal. It has facilities
for GE production and specialties, set up in technical collaboration with Societe Des Electrodes ET
Refractaries Savoie (SERS), a subsidiary of Pechiney of France. It is India&rsquo;s largest exporter with
55 per cent of its produce being exported to more than 40 countries of the world.
<p>Hindustan Electro-Graphites vision statement is quite powerful:
<p>1. Vision: To have a global perspective.
2. Mission: Never restrict to the domestic market and aim at achieving a respectable world market
<p>share.
3. Goals: Investments to be made for new facilities for growth in market share. Product mix to be
<p>expanded with quality improvement.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management538
<p>4. Objectives: The major thrust is on producing GE at low cost and focus on higher segment of
the users ready to pay the price for a better quality product.
<p>The market segments of HEG are:
<p>1. High-effi ciency product segment of Essar Steels and TISCO in India, Sigri of Germany and Ucar
Carbon of USA.
<p>2. The middle segment wants a value for money product.
3. The lower-end segment is the one competing with the Chinese players.
<p>Hindustan Electro-Graphites has defi ned its marketing policy in the following way:
<p>1. Ensure full customer satisfaction with prompt service, courteous behaviour and motivate the
employees for such effi cient service.
<p>2. Locate customer complaints and nip them in the bud.
3. Build relationship with the customers.
4. Work at the relationship all the time.
5. Keep generating enthusiasm in the customers with special attention, gifts.
6. Approach new customers and provide them with prompt courteous service.
<p>The company is focused on providing value to the customers and not just satisfaction. Customers
are retained through superior service and products. New customers come through HEG&rsquo;s efforts and
word-of-mouth publicity provided by its customers.
<p>Hindustan Electro-Graphite has selected the following foreign markets where they have got a
good market share:
<p>1. North America
2. South America
3. Europe
4. South East Asia
5. Middle East
<p>The company does business in 40 countries including:
<p>1. USA
2. Canada
3. Italy
4. France
5. Australia
6. Taiwan
7. Singapore
8. South Korea
<p>A SWOT analysis of HEG is as follows:
<p>1. Strengths: Leading GE maker in India with 45 per cent market share. It exports 55 per cent of
its produce. It exports its products to 40 countries. It has ISO 9002 certifi cation. It has strong
fi nances and management.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Understanding Case Studies 539
<p>2. Weaknesses: Dependence on imported raw materials, heavy inventory of fi nished goods due
to recession, poor R&amp;D.
<p>3. Opportunities: Growing demand of the product in developing nations. It has global marketing
experience.
<p>4. Threats: Severe international competition, including from China. The demand for GEs is a
derived demand and it depends on the demand of the steel industry, which fl uctuates with
the country&rsquo;s gross national product (GNP).
<p>Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force Model analysis reveals the following about HEG:
<p>1. Threat of new entrants is less as the industry requires huge capital; existing players have achieved
economies of scale.
<p>2. Supplier&rsquo;s have great bargaining power as they are well organised and few in number.
3. Customer&rsquo;s bargaining power is high as the product is undifferentiated, has a large production
<p>base and imports are available at competitive prices.
4. The threat of substitute products is not there, but steel making technology is undergoing changes,
<p>which threatens to do away with GEs.
5. Existing fi rms&rsquo; rivalry is intense as the product made is the same and is produced in large
<p>quantities by all the players.
<p>The improvement opportunities and problems of the industry are as follows:
<p>1. Middle segment has Chinese products where HEG had a stronghold earlier.
2. Changes in steel making technology.
3. Challenges of possible price wars.
4. Political instabilities in the world.
5. Success or failure of quality programme of HEG.
<p>The marketing solutions are:
<p>1. To fi ght the price competition from China, HEG should start building relationships with the
customers, to enlighten them on the hidden extra expenses they have to undergo when they
use inferior Chinese products.
<p>2. The company should plan downsizing its operations to become cost effective.
3. Eliminate non-value adding tasks.
4. Arrange order-based production and inventories.
5. Organise cross-functional teams for greater coordination.
6. Along with international sales agents, HEG should start its own marketing operations in the
<p>countries it has a strong footing.
<p>Task for Students
Defi ne the goals that HEG should set for itself and the methods it should use for achieving the same.

<p>CASE STUDY 4: MICROSOFT INC. USA&mdash;THE WORLD LEADER
IN SOFTWARE
<p>Start any computer around the world and more than 90 per cent you will fi nd that it is running on the
Microsoft Windows operating system. The fi rm is as controversial as it is successful and infl uential.
It touches the lives of billions of people and it has changed the way people manage and work in offi ces,
homes, factories and how they correspond with each other.
<p>If there is a fi rm that evokes intense feelings of love or hatred it is Microsoft! Its founder Bill Gates
is already a cult fi gure worshipped and idolised by millions of young and old in the world. From a
middle-class family, he inherited his acumen from his mother and shrewdness from his father. In just
20 years he has become the richest man on the planet. Where do they go from here?
<p>Microsoft strives to produce innovative products to meet the evolving needs of knowledgeable
customers.
<p>1. Mission: Microsoft started in 1975, with a mission to create software for personal computers
(PCs) that empower and enrich people at home and at their workplace, at schools and in
laboratories.
<p>2. Vision: Its early vision was to see a computer on every desk, in every home and it is now
coupled with a strong commitment to internet technologies expanding the reach and power of
PC users.
<p>3. Values: Microsoft&rsquo;s values are enshrined in the following tenets:
<p> Customers: Helping them achieve their goals by listening to them and quickly delivering new
innovative products; building relationships based on trust, respect and understanding and
service support.
<p> Innovation: Moving with the speed of light for bringing new products in the market to remain
competitive with reduced costs as well.
<p> Partners: Helping them grow in their business.
Integrity: Acting with utmost integrity, Microsoft&rsquo;s team is guided by what is right for their
<p>customers.
People: The team must have an exciting challenging career with growth opportunity and
<p>well-balanced home and work life.
Entrepreneurial culture: The team must remain passionate about their work, contributing
<p>to the evolution of technology to remain competitive.
Diversity: The team is encouraged to participate in diverse activities, with equal chance of
<p>promotion and increments for the members.
Community: Microsoft feels responsible to the community in which they operate and wants
<p>to make a meaningful difference in its life.
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s fi nance as on June 1999 was as follows:
<p>1. Net revenue: US$ 19.75 billion.
2. Net income: US$ 7.79 billion.

Microsoft has been living in the shadow of its illustrious founder. While Bill Gates has many friends,
<p>his opponents believe he is shrewd and manipulative and wants to dominate the world. Microsoft
needs to improve its image to come out of the predicament it faces today.
<p>In 1995, the fi rm almost lost the battle of the internet to Netscape and Sun Microsystems. Microsoft
was caught napping. Microsoft needs feedback from its marketing wing to their R&amp;D to get informa-
tion about the latest needs of customers. Microsoft must make more friends than foes. It should
not consider that it itself a know-all fi rm. It could consider splitting into several smaller fi rms with
independent decision-making under one overall umbrella.
<p>International Business Machines (IBM) is reeling under competitive pressure and does not know
what hit them. Microsoft must not fall into the same trap. If they do not learn from history then history
is likely to repeat itself.

Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Microsoft and recommend a marketing strategy which would
help them in retaining their leadership position.

<p>CASE STUDY 5: INFOSYS TECHNOLOGIES LTD&mdash;
THE INDIAN INTERNATIONAL GIANT
<p>Infosys Technologies Ltd (ITL) is a leading Indian fi rm in software services and packages for exports
and for the domestic market. Its clients include several Fortune 500 companies. The Indian software
industry is fragmented with several players in the fi eld. India&rsquo;s unique selling proposition (USP) in
the global market is that there is a large English-speaking trained workforce, which is still available
at a relatively low cost.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management542
<p>Infosys has grown in strength with special product developments like Y2K solutions in 2000,
IntERPryz for Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and InEuro for Euro banking services. It is
the fi rst Indian fi rm to be listed on the US Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, after its successful issue of
American Depository Receipt (ADR) in 1999.
<p>The management of ITL is totally inspired by its mentor and former chief managing director,
Narayan Murthy, and is characterised by the following qualities:
<p>1. Technically-qualifi ed professional management.
2. Having rich experience of large export orders.
3. Stakeholder-friendly approach.
4. Positioning in high growth areas.
5. Human resource policies for merit recognition.
6. Focus on core areas.
<p>Till 2000, India had a boom time in the software industry. The events of 11 September 2001, how-
ever, brought the industry down, at least temporarily. India&rsquo;s competitive advantage in the fi eld of
software lies in the following areas:
<p>1. Cost-effective software
2. World-class quality
3. High reliability
4. Rapid delivery
<p>India&rsquo;s position can be seen from the following matrix given in Figure 23.1.

<p>In 1999, the growth of the industry was 46 per cent and it was expected to grow at 50 per cent,
but the catastrophe of 11 September 2001 derailed the momentum of growth.

<p>CASE STUDY 6: EXHIBITIONS INDIA PRIVATE LTD&mdash;
AN INTERNATIONAL PLAYER FROM INDIAN
<p>Exhibitions India (EI) has an outstanding reputation for organising international and national
exhibitions and conferences. The following fi rms come under the EI umbrella:
<p>1. Comnet Exhibitions Private Ltd.
2. Comnet Advertising Private Ltd.
3. Comnet Travels Private Ltd.
4. Comnet Publishing Private Ltd.
<p>The genesis of EI was from the idea of providing a forum for business-to-business interaction.
Starting out as an agency of international organisers, it has now become one itself.
<p>Exhibitions organised by EI include:
<p>1. Convergence India, an International exhibition and conference of broadcast, cable and satellite
equipment.
<p>2. Commsindia, a comprehensive event for the telecom sector.
3. Bank net, meant for the banking sector.
4. Space 1999, an exhibition on the space technology.
5. Captech 2000, an exhibition for the capacitor industry.
6. Build India/Environment India/Water India.
7. Pride of India, an exhibition held in Vietnam.
<p>The vision, mission, goals and objectives of the fi rm are as follows:
<p>1. Vision: EIs vision is to be leader in business-to-business interaction with total transparency,
honesty and ethical behaviour.
<p>2. Mission: Its mission statement is crisp and to the point&mdash;&lsquo;committed to excellence&rsquo;.
3. Goals: To increase trade between different areas through business-to-business interactions.
4. Objectives: To maintain high levels of excellence for providing a neutral platform for business,
<p>industry and government interactions through exhibitions and seminars.
<p>The company manages its value chain effi ciently, which involves the following activities:
<p>1. Government approvals and support of the ministries.
2. Support of industry associations.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management546
<p>3. Corporate world for participating in the events.
4. Bringing out brochures and pamphlets.
5. Setting up of stalls.
6. Opening day inaugural functions.
<p>Marketing at EI: As per the norms of the service industry, they have nothing tangible to offer other
than space in the exhibition. The marketing tasks includes communicating the benefi ts the exhibitor
will obtain from taking part in the exhibition.
<p>Among its clients are the public sector, government bodies and the private fi rms. Private fi rms
take much less time in deciding to participate. The governmental bodies take much longer to decide,
necessitating the use of differential time approach by EI.
<p>The company uses telemarketing as one of the initial tools to familiarise clients with the event that
is going to take place. They have generated a database of over 5,000 fi rms as prospective clients for
their events. The phone calls give an idea of interest generated in the client&rsquo;s mind regarding the event.
Personal meetings to solicit participation follow the calls. These visits are carried forward by mails,
phone calls, e-mails with the details of the event and participation entry forms with the rate cards.
<p>The company believes that direct mail is a good beginning of their sales campaign. This is carried out
through teaser mails, brochures, pamphlets and reports of previous exhibitions with their results.
<p>Exhibitions India believes that after the event, management of the clients is as important as getting
the client to participate in the event. This is done through post-exhibition reports, which gives the order
bookings, effective business dialogues and some photographs of the dignitaries from the business
world, the government and the media coverage of the event.
<p>Exhibitions India has competition, the major ones being the following:
<p>1. Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).
2. India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO).
<p>The company is comparatively small and enjoys the benefi ts of a fl at-structured fi rm with fast
decision-making. It is also competing as a cost-effective fi rm as it can offer competing rates for stalls
in the exhibitions.
<p>The shortcomings of EI are:
<p>1. Services provided are common to those provided by the other competitors with no
differentiation.
<p>2. Low manpower affects the performance at times.
3. No venue of their own for exhibitions.
4. Low brand equity, which is surely but slowly improving in the area, which matters to them.
<p>In order to overcome its shortcomings, EI could arrange the following:
<p>1. Buyer and seller meets, both national and international.
2. Organise general purpose fairs for both the public and business.
3. Try to get better rates from the exhibition ground owners.
4. Arrange exhaustive market survey in different areas of current business interest.
5. Communicate with major clients through focused information, which would be of interest to
<p>them rather than sending them general brochures.
6. Increase worldwide geographic coverage.</p>

and timely delivery. The fi rm has about 14 models of cars, vans and jeep. In the small car segment, it
competes with Hyundai&rsquo;s Santro, Tata&rsquo;s Indica and Daewoo Motors&rsquo; Matiz. Matiz is facing problems
because of Daewoo&rsquo;s problems worldwide and its sell off.
<p>Maruti&rsquo;s vision and mission statements are:
<p>1. Vision: To be competitive worldwide in products and services; retain leadership in the country
and aspire for a good market share internationally.
<p>2. Mission: To sell a variety of cars&mdash;modern, high technology and fuel effi cient&mdash;for Indian and
foreign markets.
<p>The fi rm&rsquo;s values are as follows:
<p>1. Growth-oriented organisation ready to change to meet customer&rsquo;s demand at short notice.
2. Value for money for customers.
3. Stakeholders&rsquo; involvement and satisfaction.
4. Responsible corporate citizen.
<p>Maruti&rsquo;s motto is &lsquo;build trust worldwide&rsquo;.
Coming to a competitive analysis of Maruti, Maruti had a good run till 1998, when several inter-
<p>national players challenged its supremacy. In the small car segment, Matiz of Daewoo Motors, Santro
of Hyundai and Indica from the Tatas have posed major problems for Maruti. In the luxury segment,
its Esteem faces competition from Honda City, Opel Astra, Ford Escort and Ford Ikon. Its jeep, Gypsy,
faces competition from Mahindra&rsquo;s jeeps and from Armada, Sumo and Safari.
<p>The threat of new entrants is real as the segment of middle-class cars is growing rapidly. Volvo,
Volkswagen and Toyota are planning to enter the market.
<p>With Maruti&rsquo;s brand image, economies of scale and marketing and service network, new fi rms
have to spend a lot of money and effort and that could be the entry barrier in the case while there is
no barrier now from the government side.</p>

<p>Maruti&rsquo;s critical success factors are:
<p> 1. Suzuki technology
2. Economic scale of production
3. Strong R&amp;D
4. Timely market feedback as a result of continuous research
5. Large range of models
6. Strong dealer network
7. Large service network around the country with trained technicians
8. Quality programmes&mdash;Kaizan
9. Design expertise
10. Brand equity
11. Provide leasing options, hire purchase schemes
<p>Realising the imminence of competition in 1998, Maruti planned to have relationship marketing,
with an idea of selling Maruti cars to its existing customer base and upgrading the product purchases.
Maruti brought out Zen, Alto and WagonR, for this purpose.
<p>Maruti has competitive advantage in the segments it operates in. To counter the onslaught of com-
petition, MUL even reduced the price of its cars and went for volume business. It has maintained its
competitive advantage in the following manner:
<p>1. Superior Suzuki compact car technology.
2. Value for money.
3. Low on maintenance costs.
4. Reliable quality.
5. Largest network of dealers and service centres.
6. Large product range for various needs and pockets.
7. Easy availability and attractive fi nance schemes.
8. ISO certifi cation, even for a large number of dealers.
9. Technology transfers to important vendors for ensuring quality supplies.
<p>Maruti is a household name not only in India but in a number of countries of the West as well. With
a modest beginning in 1997, when they exported 102 cars, now they export to more than 74 countries.
The number of cars exported has gone up to 30,000. The countries MUL exports to include Italy,
Holland and Chile. Around 70 per cent of its export sales are to Europe.
<p>Maruti looks to future with confi dence with the following agenda:
<p>1. Commitment to customer satisfaction/delight.
2. Expansion and modernisation of the facilities.
3. New models as per market demand.
4. Model upgradation.
5. Market research to remain proactive in the market place.
6. Emphasis on overseas markets.
7. Finance for customers.</p>

<p>CASE STUDY 8: WHIRLPOOL OF INDIA LTD&mdash;AN MNC IN INDIA
<p>Whirlpool&rsquo;s vision is to have a presence in every home of the country&mdash;with pride, passion and per-
formance. They believe they create the world&rsquo;s best home appliances to make people&rsquo;s life easier and
more enjoyable around the world.
<p>1. Pride in the work and in the employees. It is measured by vigorous process of determining the
commitment, capabilities and contribution of the employees.
<p>2. Passion for creating unmatched customer loyalty for their brands, which is measured by growth
in revenues, market share, market position and brand loyalty.
<p>3. Performance results should excite and reward the global investors and other stakeholders with
superior results. The results are measured by calculating the economic value additions and not
just the return on investment.
<p>Whirlpool is committed to achieving global leadership by creating value for its three major
stakeholders as follows:
<p>1. Customers: The fi rm has customer focus in all their markets, products and services and it con-
tinuously measures customer satisfaction to ensure that they prefer the Whirlpool brand.
Through their worldwide excellence system, they achieve improvement in their results and
attain breakthroughs in lowest defect levels and low supply cycle time. It enables them to exceed
customer expectations and outperform competition.
<p>2. Employees: The fi rm creates a culture for high performance that encourages the employees to
contribute to the tasks fully as individuals and as teams. In a dynamic environment, diversity
and pursuit of world-class performance is obtained from the employees.
<p>3. Shareholders: With the aim of global leadership, the fi rm delivers great shareholder value and
in the top 25 per cent of fi rms in the fi eld.
<p>The worldwide excellence system (WES) is the blueprint for Whirlpool quality management. It
constitutes the operating system for achieving its objectives, which are as follows:
<p>1. Leadership and people: At all levels, people must act to reach excellence.
2. Strategic planning, fact-based management and quality of process and products are the major
<p>internal processes for achieving excellence.
3. Measurement and results set out for meaningful quantifi able measurements, which can be
<p>tracked down for improving quality.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management550
<p>4. The customer satisfaction commitment of the fi rm includes meeting the customer&rsquo;s expectations,
service standards, relationships and satisfactory resolution of complaints.
<p>The WES also provides a feedback loop where the response of customers about the products and
services is fed back into the system, driving further process improvement and refi ning the direction
of effort.
<p>Whirlpool Corporation of the USA is a leading manufacturer and marketer of major home
appliances. The fi rm manufactures in 13 countries and markets in 170 countries under the brand
names Whirlpool, Kitchen Aid and Roper.
<p>Whirlpool India is a subsidiary of Whirlpool Inc. It acquired a majority stake in Kelvinator of India
in 1996. It started with the following four products under the Whirlpool brand:
<p>1. Refrigerators
2. Washing machines
3. Air conditioners
4. Microwave ovens
<p>Keeping to the core business of white goods, they have discontinued unrelated lines. As a result,
it has divested from its compressors and automotive division.
<p>Coming to the management strategy of the fi rm, it follows an expansionist strategy to avail the
opportunities in the Indian market. The strategy has the following thrust areas:
<p>1. To register growth in the market through brand leadership, to make Whirlpool a dominant
brand.
<p>2. To make external focus of satisfying customer needs.
3. To achieve business growth through high volumes, high quality and low costs.
4. To focus on core competencies and to have the best capabilities in the industry.
5. To have high profi t and most effi cient cost structure in the industry.
<p>The consumer durables industry is characterised by the following:
<p>1. Formidable entry barriers in terms of brand equity, distribution and service networks.
2. Manufacture of most durables is neither capital nor technology intensive, the need for constant
<p>product innovation makes R&amp;D a key factor.
3. Rationalisation of duties and opening up of the economy has attracted a host of global players.
4. Increased competitive pressures and over-zealous capacity creation have resulted in lower
<p>margins, which are expected to aggravate.
5. The market for most consumer durables are in the nascent stage and penetration levels are low.
6. The sector is price sensitive and each durable is a life time purchase.
7. Refrigerators and washing machines sales are seasonal. Peak period for refrigerator sales are
<p>the summer months and for washing machines during the monsoon season.
<p>The consumer durable market in India is estimated at Rs 100 billion. The rural market, which has
50 per cent of the target group, has lower levels of penetration. Favourable personal tax, politics and
increase in credit fi nancing are expected to increase spending capability on durables. Realising the
potential, an annual growth rate of 24 per cent is predicted over the next three years and helped by
the liberal foreign investment politics, most MNCs dealing in consumer durables have established
base in India through tie-ups (see Figure 23.3).</p>

<p>The refrigerator market has two segments, the direct cool type and the frost-free type. Its penetration
levels are as follows:
<p>1. Urban: 32 per cent
2. Rural: 10 per cent
<p>The installed capacity in the country is 3.2 million units per annum while the demand is 2.8 million
units only.
<p>Whirlpool sells both the direct cool and the frost-free refrigerators in different sizes and have
introduced the fi rst CFC-free, no frost refrigerator. Its campaign, &lsquo;ice, ice baby&rsquo; has helped the fi rm
in achieving great success.
<p>The market share in percentage of refrigerators in India is as shown in Table 23.6.

<p>Whirlpool&rsquo;s marketing strategy can be summarised as follows:
<p>1. To place Whirlpool washing machine with every customer in every price segment.
2. Marketing only top-loading machines.
3. Started with top-of-the-line front-loading machines.
4. Whirlpool&rsquo;s creative campaign &lsquo;one-two, one-two&rsquo; has been a big success.
<p>Whirlpool is planning to bring a new range of refrigerators in the near future. This would be known
as Opera and would consist of the following:
<p>1. 180 litres, four models&mdash;Futura, Home maker, Master piece, Break the barrier.
2. 210 litres, two models&mdash;Futura and Home maker.
<p>These brands would be common to India, Brazil and Mexico, which is part of the policy to position
the global products in India.
<p>Whirlpool believes that there are three types of competitors in India as discussed next:
<p>1. Basic trading instincts of buying and selling low-value products. This is going to continue for
a while. Some large competitors with high brand awareness in the country, which is not built
on a strong platform of differentiation.
<p>2. There are the South-east Asian types, not just the Koreans. A number of technology-driven
fi rms pack their gizmos with features and some are good with futuristic plans.
<p>3. The best products and technology do not build big business or brands, which depends on
consumer perception. There is competition from the developed countries of the West. They have
a different approach involving clearly differentiated products for the fi rm and its brand.
<p>Who is going to succeed will depend on the policies and plans the fi rms have for India. Whirlpool
wants to place its strategy on the third category.
<p>Whirlpool&rsquo;s growth will depend on the following aspects:
<p>1. The industry&rsquo;s phase is of consolidation and the number of players will reduce in a few years,
which would have a positive impact on sales.
<p>2. Possible decline in commodity prices in the international market for steel and copper could
lead top procurement savings for lower manufacturing costs.
<p>3. Phasing out of CFC products is to the benefi t of Whirlpool as it has launched an array of
CFC-free products conforming to the Montreal Protocol.</p>

<p>4. A 4 per cent levy on import duty and rupee depreciation is likely to affect the fi rm&rsquo;s cost struc-
ture, as a large proportion of raw material is imported. The fi rm is on an indigenisation drive
for sourcing components to overcome dependence on imports.
<p>5. Whirlpool keeps more than one supplier for its components.
6. Most global majors are competing in India, due to its vast potential market. Indian fi rms also
<p>compete with Whirlpool.

<p>CASE STUDY 9: PRICE WATERHOUSE&mdash;INTERNATIONAL
CONSULTANCY COMPANY
<p>Traditionally an accountancy fi rm, it was started by Samuel Price and Edwin Waterhouse in 1849 in
London UK. In 1930, the partners fanned out across the world, establishing semi-autonomous prac-
tice for accountancy investigations, liquidation and other fi nancial services. It was only from 1980
that Price Waterhouse (PW) started management consultancy in a big way as several fi rms started
accepting consultancy as a useful profession. It has added technical research to their portfolio, an
advance technology centre in artifi cial intelligence in the US with a US$ 410 million development
centre in London for information technology (IT) skills.
<p>The USP of PW comes from combining the roles of a consultant and an implementer.
Its vision reads as follows: The fi rm is committed to turning strategic insight into tactical action
<p>(strategic implementation), for our clients. In doing so we provide them with high quality, leading edge,
industry-focused services and solutions, wherever they do business.
<p>Their mission statement reads as follows: To be the global consultants to top-layer fi rms by solv-
ing their complex business problems.
<p>The international growth phase of PW began after World War II, when partnerships were set up in
different parts of the world. These were mainly offi ces to serve audit clients in the fi rst instance. Tax
consultancy services were added in the large offi ces. Today, PW has 434 offi ces in 119 countries.
<p>The highly-regarded fi rm, Emerson Research, rates PW as simply one of the best in its 1998 client
satisfaction survey of high-technology fi rms. Price Waterhouse ranked fi rst, in 11 of 13 client satisfaction
categories among 293 audit clients of the six big fi rms. Price Waterhouse earned fi ve-star status in
four categories and it bagged more number one rankings than any of the other six big consultancy
fi rms (Table 23.9).
<p>Clients have singled out PW among the big six fi rms in serving high-technology fi rms as can be
seen from comments:
<p>They have a high degree of responsiveness and professionalism.
<p>Overall they are exceptional.
<p>I think they do mergers and acquisitions very well. It is a specialty of PW.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management554
<p>Auditing is a competitive area and therefore the fi rm has diversifi ed its management consultancy
to cover such industries as entertainment, media and high technology. To keep abreast of industry
trends, PW has formed a new consulting group for electronics and online fi nancial services.
<p>Price Waterhouse is restructuring itself along product lines, as opposed to territorial divisions to
serve the full range of its multinational clients. The purpose of the renewal efforts is helping fi rms
in implementing strategies to improve business performance and shareholder values. Price Water-
house helps bring about organisational and strategic changes. Its competitive advantage lies in its
meeting audit and tax requirements with greater speed, with improved software packages for its
client&rsquo;s benefi t.
<p>Price Waterhouse&mdash;The Indian Profi le
<p>Price Waterhouse was established in India in 1880 as a part of the worldwide network of Price Water-

2. Price Waterhouse &amp; Co
3. Choksey &amp; Co
4. IPAN
<p>Price Waterhouse India is a separate profi t centre for the parent fi rm; it is their strategic business
unit (SBU). Partners of the Indian operations have stock options in the parent fi rm. The parent fi rm
does regular internal audit in order to ensure that they conform to their strict guidelines.
<p>In order to scan the competitive environment, Porters Five-force Model is used as follows:
<p>1. Bargaining power of the customers: It is moderate as the customers have the choice to select
from various consultants, but it is not high as most of them provide certain specifi c and spe-
cialised services.
<p>2. Bargaining power of the suppliers: They include the business schools and the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India. Their bargaining power is moderate as consultancy is a refi ned
form of business dealings&mdash;an aspect highly appealing to intelligent experts. The managerial
talent of business schools prefers to join the consultants.
<p>3. Threat of new entrants: The threat of new fi rms entering the area is high as it is a growing and
profi table business.
<p>4. Threat of substitute products: This would come from internal experts of the clients. The threat
from them is low as the internal experts may not have the vast resources, which are available
to the consultants. Firms generally prefer to go to consultants.</p>
<br>

<p>Competition among rival fi rms is high. The major players include the following:
<p> 1. Anderson Worldwide
2. Vooz Allen
3. PA Consulting Group
4. PE Consultants
5. Mackenzie
6. Boston Consulting Group
7. KPMG
<p>The critical success factors for a consultancy fi rm like PW are as follows:
<p> 1. Consultants form the backbone of the fi rm: The two basic characteristics of consultants are high
intelligence and expertise in different areas as needed. John Foden, CEO of PA Consulting Group,
identifi es three characteristics of an ideal consultant, which are (a) ability to listen, (b) capacity for
analysing the situation and (c) capacity to come up with creative knowledge-based solutions.
<p> 2. HR planning: They employ meticulous care in recruiting management trainees from the best
schools.
<p> 3. Career development opportunities: The promotions are performance related.
4. Pay package.
5. Continuous training and upgrading of skills.
6. Establishment of relationship with clients.
7. Uniqueness of ideas.
8. Development of new ideas.
9. Experience.
10. Latest management ideas.
11. Effi cient management information systems.
<p>The dictum is that a fi rm is as good as its clients.

<p>CASE STUDY 10: JAPAN&mdash;COUNTRY-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
<p>Japan in the last 60 years may not have forgotten the defeat in World War II, but due to the indomit-
able spirit of its populace, it has come out a winner in the business world, with extremely high growth
rate as compared to even its victors. Pre-war Japanese products sold in India were not considered
to be of good quality. &lsquo;Oh! It is a Japanese product&rsquo; were the derisive words used for imports from
Japan. How this dramatic change took place makes an interesting case study. Japan has no natural
resources, is plagued with recurrent earthquakes, has very little land and is made up of several </p>

<p>Understanding Case Studies 557
<p>islands. Its culture is age old and people are bound by traditions. The transformation from a laid-
back, tradition-bound country into a modern, fast-moving, dynamic business potentate has left most
theorists and philosophers agape with wonder.
<p>After World War II, Japan became an ally of the powerful USA, who incidentally took over the
country&rsquo;s defence, a fact that left the Japanese ready to concentrate on nation-rebuilding activities.
To create wealth for the country, business and industry were the most important planks and they
went into these areas with full vigour. This time around the Japanese wanted to drop the tag of poor-
quality suppliers. For this purpose, they invited business gurus from the US who toured the country
giving their inputs about quality-improving techniques. Quick on the uptake, the Japanese improved on
the teachings of the gurus and came out with the Quality Circle Programme, which has revolutionised
business the world over. Over the last 60 years, Japanese innovations in the fi eld of business and
industry have underscored even the success of the giant, the US. Some of their strategic decisions
and innovations are:
<p>1. Understanding the value of money blocked in inward inventories, they introduced to the world
the &lsquo;just in time&rsquo; (JIT) plan, which helped save costs to the tune of 10 per cent in having virtually
no inventories. JIT works well if there is close partnership like cooperation between the fi rm
and the supplier. In turn, it becomes useful to see that the supplier is also having JIT deliveries
from his suppliers. Such a chain can account for large sums of money being released for the
purposes of development and growth.
<p>2. Zero defect production came about with the help of total quality management (TQM) and the
Quality Circle Programme. Firms could eliminate the fi nal product testing and could disband the
entire set of engineers involved in the testing process. This led to higher production, lower
rejections and savings of raw material and manpower and reworking costs. This made the
Japanese competitive in the world.
<p>3. Suppliers ceased to be necessary evils who never supplied on time, gave defective products
and always wanted higher prices for their products. Joining hands with suppliers and making
them almost their partners, helping them in their JIT and quality programmes gave the fi rms
and the supplier&rsquo;s confi dence in each other. Firms have been able to reduce costs by eliminating
suppliers&rsquo; assessment for each order placed with them. It has also helped in reducing the time
needed to bring new products in the market as new materials are available from the partnership
sources without delay.
<p>4. Japanese innovation of small teams, the quality circles, which manage continuous incremental
improvements in the fi rms&rsquo; processes to create low-cost and high-profi t systems.
<p>5. Japanese fi rms bring about technological cohesion by using different technology together as
tech-fusion. This has brought about a paradigm shift in the area of product development. Hybrid
technologies like opto-electronics mechatronics are an example of tech-fusion.
<p>6. Japanese fi rms believe in cross-functional teams and fl exible structures in problem-solving
areas. The product development process time has been greatly reduced in view of the market
demands and shortening product life cycles.
<p>Japanese fi rms believe that if the employees are fully motivated, have job satisfaction and teamwork,
they can create better organisational processes and work with total dedication and this is achieved
through well-structured programmes like the quality circles. Quality circles are engaged in the
processes as follows:
<p>1. Problem-fi nding action.
2. Problem-solving function.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management558
<p>3. Solution action plans.
4. Feedback loops.
5. Integrated responsibility.
6. Study of the environment to avoid pitfalls.
<p>Problem fi nding goes down the fi rm&rsquo;s ladder as even the lowly worker is expected to locate prob-
lems, so that they can be nipped in the bud and the need for fi nding solutions does not arise. Also, if the
workers fi nd the problems and solutions to the problems, it would be easy during implementation.
<p>Problem solving leads to fi nding solutions of the market needs, new products and services; solu-
tions to quality problems, process problems and product differentiation plans of existing products to
bring sustainable competitive advantage.
<p>Using new ideas in the existing processes, the fi rm arrives at solution implementation. Most Indian
fi rms do not want to have workers trying to fi nd out the solutions for their own workstation problems,
as they consider them unworthy of taking important decisions and they believe that only top man-
agers are capable of fi nding the solutions to the problems. This leads to solutions being thrust upon
the juniors, which they resent and hence do not feel committed to implementing them.
<p>Employees suggestion plan: While these plans are in place in several countries, they have become
the moving spirit for job satisfaction. All suggestions are given due credit and as the suggestions
are made after thorough investigations and experimentation, they are implemented. Employees feel
highly motivated to see their ideas implemented. Quality circles help generate the suggestions and on
a regular basis, the Japanese worker keeps sending suggestions with a yearly average of a minimum 50
to a maximum 1,000 suggestions, where the average for the American worker comes to about three.
<p>Problems in Japan are considered as benefi cial because they provide the fi rm with impetus to
overcome them and improve the fi rm&rsquo;s effi ciency even further.
<p>Japanese business culture believes that for furthering the cause of the fi rm they need people with
good education. The fi rms believe in collective decision-making with upward fl ow of decisions. The
main points of their business culture are:
<p>1. Authority with seniority.
2. Respect for age.
3. Life-long employment.
4. Loyalty to the fi rm.
5. Participation in the quality circles.
6. Group information and decisions in quality circles.
7. Emphasis on productivity.
8. Debt fi nancing is facilitated by the banks.
9. Slow decision-making process but fast implementation.

<p>CASE STUDY 11: INTERNATIONAL MARKETING BY
FORD CARS IN INDIA
<p>Ford singled out Indian car market because of its cost competitiveness. The product should be designed
to cover the costs and compete in the price-sensitive market. Cars should be tough as Indian roads
are bad and the terrain is rough. The temperatures can be quite high necessitating air conditioning,
at least in medium-sized cars. Indian buyers are like buyers anywhere in the world; they know what
they want. Urban India is characterised by the following:
<p>1. English literacy
2. Internet literacy
3. Well connected with the world through the Internet
<p>Indian customers know what is available elsewhere in the world and they want it but at prices
they can afford to pay. They are looking for value for money products. Customers are fully conscious of
quality and latest technology in the world market. They do not go for technological advancements
unless they know their benefi ts to them. As far as the quality of cars is concerned, they do not know
about it beforehand, but once they use a quality product they stick with it and they become the most
demanding customers in terms of quality in the world.
<p>Indians have a great sense of value. When Ford brought out their Ikon car, with a superior feeling
that matched the demands of Indian customers, they could justify its purchase. Ford was launched
in 1996, in the mid-car segment, with quality and customer service as its USPs. They have found that
the Indian customer is sophisticated, well informed and has the upper hand. With several players,
including Maruti&rsquo;s Esteem, Opel Astra, Honda City, Mitsubishi Lancer and Fiat&rsquo;s Palio in the same
category, cars crowd the market and in its true sense it is a buyer&rsquo;s market.
<p>Market Trends
Small- and mid-sized cars are going to be sold in large numbers in India for quite some time to come.
In the fi rst instance, buyers go for small cars as they are easy to manoeuvre in crowded roads and are
easy to park. Next, when they can afford it, they go for mid-sized cars. That is where Ford&rsquo;s dealer
network scores over others, with its strong customer bonding. Even during recession, Ford could sell
its Escort car fairly well, in contrast to the competition. How they succeeded in launching Ford Ikon
despite the recession is discussed next:

<p>Understanding Case Studies 565
<p>FORD Company&mdash;let us try hardest and achieve, leaving nothing to chance and we are sure,
chance, fate will be on our side.
<p>Market Scenario was as given below:
<p> No choice in buying cars to More Choices&mdash;does it add to confusion among the customers?
Acceptability criteria changed as Quality became the basis of selection of cars.
Honda and Opel enjoyed high brand equity.
<p>Key Discoveries for Ford Brand:
<p> Ford was synonymous of Escort&mdash;Ford Escort cars were the only Ford Cars popular in India.
For several decades Ford was accepted as a Trustworthy and Reliable Car.
Ford builds cars that are engineered for India, safe and sturdy.
Ford cars are dependable.
Fore cars were not known to be exciting cars.
Ford was known as an American company.
<p> A Visceral understanding of the customer was undertaken to get to the key customer insights
and it was considered that the psychographics segment for Ford Ikon would be Full of Life. After
exhaustive survey of 1,200 car owners two broad classifi cations emerged:
<p> The enthusiasts
Non-enthusiasts
<p>Six clusters in Mumbai and Delhi emerged as follows:
<p>Driving Enthusiasts Driving Non-Enthusiasts
<p>Starting out small&mdash;20 per cent Contented conformists&mdash;17 per cent
<p>Affl uent People&mdash;13 per cent The Upper Crust&mdash;4 per cent
<p>Full of Life&mdash;20 per cent Life without Spice&mdash;26 per cent
<p>The Key Discoveries on the customer&rsquo;s were as follows:
<p> The customer belongs to the FULL OF LIFE segment.
He is young, in early thirties, and has a successful carrier.
He is well travelled, aware of the latest trends and technologies worldwide. He will not be
<p>taken for a ride.
He wants to show that he has arrived and his car plays a key role in that.
He is a driving enthusiast and his car is an important possession for him.
Brand and price are important considerations for him.
The customer may belong to erstwhile refugee family with &lsquo;spirit of fl amboyance.&rsquo;
The customer is a positive thinker, &lsquo;I can do it, must do it and will do it.&rsquo;
The customer also believes in &lsquo;If you have got it fl aunt it.&rsquo;
<p>The product strategy, which followed from the customer profi le, is as given below:
<p> Preferred car was with three box structure, unlike Maruti 800, the two box car.
The car should be built for India.
The car should have international looks to give it a new edge.
Ford should lead from the high end, as per what Ford learnt from their Escort Model.
The car should be freshened up constantly to keep up the excitement.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management566
<p>The following positioning of different cars were found:
<p> Esteem&ndash;Driving pleasure
Honda City&ndash;Power and Technology
Siena&ndash;Safety
Corsa&ndash;Technology
<p>In view of the above the following positioning strategy was formulated:
<p> There was the temptation of calling the car as &lsquo;Engineered for India&rsquo;
Of Iconising the Ford Ikon
The temptation of calling it a &lsquo;Value for money car&rsquo;
And arriving at a Brand Vision
<p>With respect to brand we sought the answer to the following question&mdash;
<p>What does the Brand offer to the customer&mdash;
<p>The large hearted, generous spirited, hard working, can do must do and will do company.
The search of Brand Vision established that customer desires, smart-working, can-do,
<p>must-do, well-do attitude
<p>Hence the Brand Vision emerged as given below&mdash;
<p>Zinda Dil&mdash;Exuberance
<p> Living life king size
Gregarious
Long hearted
<p>Ford Ikon&rsquo;s personality can be described in the following manner:
<p>BRAND VISION
<p>Why do people fi nd me appealing?
<p>I represent everything that is contemporary in Ford&mdash;From the &lsquo;New Edge&rsquo; styling to the power-
ful engines. I am being launched for the fi rst time in the world in India.
<p>What is my personality?
<p>Progressive, Contemporary, full of life, work hard play hard.
<p>Who do I appeal to?

<p>Why am I different?
<p>I am more than just sheet metal and four wheels. I am contemporary and exciting. I represent
an attitude, a way of life.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Understanding Case Studies 567
<p>How do I express myself?
<p>I am colourful, confi dent and bold. Everything I do is youthful, energetic. I appeal to the heart
more than the head.
<p>BRAND IDEA
<p>Josh&mdash;
<p> The Brand has youthful energy.
It has passion.
It is full of enthusiasm.
Its reactions are spontaneous and it provides an emotional high to its owners/users.
<p>THE COMMUNICATION PLAN
<p>Following were the discoveries in the research done prior to the campaign&mdash;
So far the communication had been conservative, feature led and product focused. The
communication idiom has been changing in the marketplace. The car had become a personality
statement for the owners. A tone change was required in Ford communication&mdash;from Test cricket
to One day international, from laid-back to vibrant and dynamic communication.
<p>The communication imperatives can be described as given below&mdash;
Planning communication in an integrated manner across the varied communication channels,
the period needed for gestation being nine months. The other imperative was THAT THE
LAUNCH NEVER ENDS, to sustain the excitement in the post launch period.
<p>CREATING A BLOCKBUSTER CAMPAIGN
<p>The creative task was to imagine how the customers really visualise communication. For this pur-
pose, it was decided to treat Press as Billboards&mdash;bring JOSH through Ikon&rsquo;s looks. The attitude
of JOSH had to be planted in the TV Ads to cut through the clutter of advertisements on TV.
The launch events were used to build JOSH theme and it was spread through road shows in
44 cities across the country.
<p>TAKING JOSH FORWARD
<p>JOSH being an emotion and sentiment, it had to be reinforced through Peer group endorsement
of the decision of purchasing the Ikon. Reviews from experts were used prominently in the AD
campaign. The drive to maintain JOSH through attitude and emotion was relentlessly pursued.
The Campaign was based on Thrill, Intoxication and Exhilaration.
<p>THE EXCITEMENT GROWS
<p>The need to sustain the JOSH was met with Strategic Launches of Car Variants. The following
versions were launched:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management568
<p> 1.3 CLXi&mdash;move up to the JOSH zone.
Rally Sport&mdash;for the Racer in you.
Exi&mdash;a sign of success.
<p>Even with these variants, the communication of JOSH was not diluted as the JOSH tongue-
in-cheek attitude was carried through even in tactical advertising as can be seen from the
following:
<p> An event lead Auto Show
Airline promotion&mdash;targeting the high fl iers
The 1.3 car Road Show&mdash;into new markets
Resort Promotion&mdash;a new contact opportunity with the customers
JOSH Karting&mdash;was meant to spread JOSH among the corporate.
<p>REINFORCING JOSH THROUGH OWNERSHIP
<p>Once a customer has purchased the JOSH Machine he has to be pampered by the company.
It is done through continuous contact programme with interaction with Ford World and Theatre
Premiers. Furthermore, a periodic feedback is obtained from the owners about their ownership
experience.
<p>Let us analyse where does JOSH fi t. Here come the JOSH FITS&mdash;
<p> Objective: to associate JOSH clearly with excitement, fun and &lsquo;IN&rsquo; things
Strategy: to create branded properties on TV, with events at happening places like Djinns
The results:
<p> (i) &lsquo;Josh action cuts&rsquo; on AXN.
(ii) &lsquo;Extreme JOSH&rsquo; on Discovery Channel.
(iii) &lsquo;Top Gaana&rsquo; on MTV.
<p>JOSH IN THE NEW MEDIA
<p>Integrated communication was achieved by the use of new media available today as follows:

<p>CASE STUDY 12: THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION
<p>Through the 1970s, Lee Iacocca was the trusted friend of the top man of the Ford Motor Company,
Henry Ford, and CEO of Ford. Lee and his wife, and Ford and his wife were often seen partying to-
gether as the spouses too had a great rapport. At that time, Lee got an offer from Chrysler to join them
as their CEO, but due to his friendship with the Fords, he rejected the offer. In 1977&ndash;78, however,
the relationship with Ford started souring and Lee was sacked by Ford on ego issues. By this time,
Chrysler was in real bad shape and they welcomed Lee with great expectations.
<p>Chrysler was the third largest automobile fi rm in the world, with a reputation of building tough
sturdy cars. Unfortunately, with one bad model, the fi rm started slipping down. The Chrysler scenario
in 1977 is given next:
<p>1. One million cars called back to the factory for retrofi tting to counter serious safety hazards.
2. New fuel effi ciency and emission norms of the government of the USA, required the fi rm to
<p>invest US$ 7.5 billion for getting new tools to do the job.
3. Cash fl ow was threatened.
4. Bankruptcy was round the corner due to the fi rm&rsquo;s inability to service the huge debts.
<p>The fi nancial situation of the fi rm in 1978 is given next:
<p>1. First quarter loss was US$ 120 million.
2. Second quarter earnings were US$ 30 million.
3. Third quarter loss was US$ 160 million.
<p>Most of the directors of Chrysler were recommending that the fi rm should declare bankruptcy.
Some had faith in Lee and on the day the third quarter results were declared, the directors also con-
fi rmed the appointment of Lee Iacocca as the new CEO of Chrysler.
<p>The Automobile Market of the 1970s and 1980s
<p>Henry Ford had stuck on to the T-model Ford car. He believed that &lsquo;if the product is selling well as
it had done from its inception why change it?&rsquo; He also did not budge on the colour issue and wanted
all his cars to be black, despite the pleadings of several of his lieutenants.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Understanding Case Studies 571
<p>General Motors (GM), albeit a late start, had come to the forefront of the car market with their new
cars in different colours, shapes and sizes. GM was, in fact, the number one fi rm in the world for all
products in terms of assets.
<p>Chrysler faced the following problems:
<p>1. Poor product quality.
2. Drop in sales.
3. Suppliers had become arrogant as they were not being paid on time.
4. Customers felt they could take full advantage of the situation.
5. Chrysler UK was doing better but being so far off, and with only 15 per cent of Chrysler business,
<p>could not be depended on to rescue it from disaster.
<p>After joining, Lee analysed the situation and planned his strategy for bringing Chrysler around
in fi ve years. He made some top-level changes, threw out the deadwood, the incompetent and non-
believers of the future success of Chrysler. He brought some of his top associates from Ford, who had
enough trust in him to leave Ford to join a declared sick fi rm. Lee&rsquo;s analysis of the scenario was:
<p>1. He needed money for R&amp;D to bring out better cars commensurate with Chrysler&rsquo;s earlier
image of building good, sturdy cars.
<p>2. Bank overdrafts had hit the limit and the banks were not interested in backing Chrysler any
more.
<p>3. Suppliers, car dealers and some senior executives had recommended that Chrysler should
declare bankruptcy.
<p>4. Lee kept persisting that Chrysler would fi nd a solution to its problems.
<p>He arranged marathon meetings with the bankers, who were aware of Lee&rsquo;s reputation, but seeing
Chrysler&rsquo;s plight decided against giving any loans to the fi rm. Unruffl ed, he went to Washington and
met some of his senator friends, who agreed to help. (There were a few senators totally opposed to
any help to Chrysler.) His senator friend prevailed on the bankers, who agreed to consider giving the
loan on a specifi c stipulation that the US government guarantees the loan.
<p>Lee decided to meet the president of the USA and on his intervention the US government agreed
to give the requisite guarantee on some diffi cult conditions like the following:
<p>1. Chrysler would reduce expenses.
2. Get some capital of its own.
3. Defer payments even further to their suppliers.
<p>At this juncture, it was the sagacity, statesmanship and discipline that Lee possessed, which
was of great importance to Chrysler. He took the following actions in order to meet with the loan
stipulations:
<p>1. Lee cut down his own salary to US$ 1 till the good times were back at Chrysler and the loan
had been repaid.
<p>2. With his immense persuasive power he made other managers work with full force and vigour
at half their salary.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management572
<p>3. Lee met all the suppliers personally and after he had explained the position they agreed to
deferred payments while continuing the supplies.
<p>4. Lee arranged some loans from private placements from his friends and completed the compliance
of the US government loan guarantee
<p>Lee got the money, invested it in R&amp;D. The new product was test marketed and the sales boomed
(see Figure 23.4). Repayment started and was over in three years&mdash;two years in advance. Banks
volunteered to give more money as required by Chrysler.
<p>Chrysler was truly on its way to becoming a force to reckon with in the automobile business again.
It could ward off the competition from Japanese cars for quite a while.
