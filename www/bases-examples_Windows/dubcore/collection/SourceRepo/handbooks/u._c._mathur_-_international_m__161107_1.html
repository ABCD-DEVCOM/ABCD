<p>Preface
<p>Indian business has to accept the fact that it can no longer remain isolated from the rest of the world
as international players are increasingly making inroads into its territory and creating unprecedented
competitive problems for business. The wise have reconciled to the situation and, in fact, shaken hands with
foreign players for mutual benefi t. The country has made great strides in joining the market economy and
has emerged as a major voice in the comity of nations and world bodies like the World Trade Organization
(WTO), as several Indian companies have already become and others are on their way to becoming
multinational corporations (MNCs).
<p>Companies planning to enter the arena of international marketing need to be fully aware of the way host
countries like to do business, their cultural ethos and parameters of social contacts in business. This book
contains fact fi les on these issues for 29 selected countries. It is recommended that students study these fact
fi les. However, as the general business environment and the political scenario keep changing, they would
do well in fi nding out the latest through organised market research or through coordinated efforts with non-
competing companies doing business there and through the embassies in these countries. These should form
guidelines for similar research when companies plan international marketing in other countries.
<p>With the full convertibility of the rupee even in capital account in the offi ng, no business can consider
itself removed from the process of internationalisation of business. This process started in 1991, when
liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation emerged as the political policies of the government. It was
the political will of the government of that time that manifested itself in the economic reforms, which have
been the hallmark of the Indian business scene since then.
<p>Managers of tomorrow are, therefore, required to be fully aware of the art and science of international
marketing. It is for this reason that the subject has been in focus in most business schools of repute. This book
attempts to make learning the nuances of the subject easy to understand from the viewpoint of students.
<p>International trade, economic free trade zones, embargoes on exports, tariff and non-tariff barriers that
companies face overseas form a major part of the book. Besides, the role of international organisations under
the aegis of the United Nations Organization (UNO) have been given due importance. Students can learn
how companies can make use of these organisations to their advantage from this book.
<p>The systems and the forms used in international marketing in India are discussed in Chapter 4
(&lsquo;International Trading&rsquo;). The existing forms have been discussed here. Each group of products has its
own export promotion council. A list of these councils has been given in the book. These councils provide
detailed information to its members. The address details of these councils, however, may need verifi cation
as these keep changing.
<p>The stakeholders of a company are the essential partners who need careful nurturing by the company.
Considering their importance in international marketing, a separate chapter has been provided to study
the various facets associated with stakeholders (see Chapter 11).
<p>An attempt has been made to make the book interactive. To this end, tasks have been provided for students
that can be performed with some guidance from the faculty teaching the subject. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management16
<p>Management games dealing with the different aspects of international marketing have been carefully
selected and included at the end of some of the chapters. The teaching faculty may divide the students into
teams of four to six members and get them to perform the tasks of these games. The faculty should guide the
students in these games and evaluate their progress. This can form part of the students&rsquo; internal assessment
process. These games also provide a hands-on learning experience to the students.
<p>Marketing functions in the international arena depend on the business environment in the host countries,
including their cultural ethos as buyer behaviour and pattern is dependent on the economic levels, political
systems prevalent in the host countries and their competitive environment. Companies need to know how
to scan these factors before planning international forays.
<p>Success in international marketing comes from the following areas:
<p> 1. Knowledge of the demand pattern across several countries.
2. Selection of the right country or countries for doing business with.
3. Understanding the general and competitive business environments of the chosen countries.
4. Establishing and then understanding the company&rsquo;s core competencies that can create competitive
<p>advantage in the host country.
5. Estimating the resources needed for getting into international markets and their proper deployment.
6. Time-bound marketing programmes with built-in monitory systems.
<p>This book contains topical, relevant and thought-provoking case studies for students. At the beginning
of the case studies, methods for attempting case studies have been provided. The case studies are meant to
take the students into a virtual corporate world, to make learning a practical and interesting exercise.
<p>This book tries to create a knowledge base for these topics, with interactive plans enabling both the
students and the faculty to make the learning process easy and interesting. The book deals with the subject
of international marketing in a lucid style using simple language for the benefi t of students. Chapter 21
(&lsquo;International Marketing Audit&rsquo;) will help students gain a practical understanding of how to conduct
an international marketing audit by providing them the example of an actual international marketing
company.
<p>The author wishes to thank Pankaj Mathur, Sanjoy Mathur and Punam Dayal who provided valuable
support and encouragement during the writing of this book.
<p>SAGE Publications deserves special mention and gratitude for all the support they provided.

<p>International Marketing Management18
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>This chapter introduces students to the different aspects of international marketing that will
enable them to learn its various nuances with relative ease. Students will learn about the major
differences between domestic and international marketing. The methods of scanning the business
<p>and competitive environment are discussed in this chapter. This will help students to plan marketing
in a number of host countries with diverse cultural backgrounds.
<p>The students are expected to have a healthy curiosity of the subject as they master the art and
science of international marketing. They will learn about the theories of international marketing
and the United Nations (UN) bodies that help in international marketing including the World Trade
Organization (WTO). Real life case studies have been provided at the end of each chapter that both
simulate the corporate world as well as stimulate the student&rsquo;s psyche into probing the subtleties of
international marketing. The systems of coordinating foreign exchange and the organisations that
facilitate international marketing have been given major importance. Countries and businesses are
now increasingly focusing on international marketing and this forms the theme of the book. The
selection process of the countries and strategic planning for going international take away the limi-
tations created by traditional minds.
<p>The discipline of studying international marketing is meant to provide students and practitioners
of marketing with a systematic methodology and intellectual framework to understand and work in
the global marketplace and to enjoy and exploit the underlying unity within the diversity of the laws
of business found in different countries.
<p>It is important for students to learn the basics of international marketing, international business,
exports and international trade.
<p>International business, today covers areas like outsourcing, third country manufacturing and
manpower deployment in different countries. International trade covers the areas of imports and
exports, including transfer of technology and international fi nancing for projects. International
marketing takes care of functions like international market research, selection of products, pricing,
distribution channels, advertising and promotion in selected countries.
<p>International marketing differs from local marketing as it has to deal with the rules and regulations
of the host countries as well as take care of the cultural diversities that exist between nations as com-
panies try to take advantage of these various cultures, by promoting ethnic products that have exotic
value for the host-country buyers. Multinational corporations (MNCs) have to understand the work
pattern of business in several countries and they have the option of retaining a global focus in all the
locations they operate from. They can also arrange to have multi-domestic operations where each host
country gets to have separate work system as desirable and conducive to the host country. Indian
business establishments have several advantages in international markets due to low-cost labour,
availability of raw materials and trained manpower.
<p>OBJECTIVES OF STUDYING INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
<p>1. To develop skills in analysing marketing challenges and opportunities.
2. To develop decision-making capabilities in marketing.
3. To gain experience in developing marketing strategies and plans that integrate functional
<p>policies through concrete, actionable recommendations.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>International Marketing 19
<p>4. To develop the verbal and written skills for communicating the recommendations, conclusions
and analytical points.
<p>5. To introduce students to the latest thinking in the fi eld of marketing theory.
6. To develop new principles of marketing that are ethical, life supporting, nourishing and
<p>evolutionary.
7. To develop both the intuition and analytical skills necessary for success in business.
<p>International marketing has gained in importance in the last decade because most countries have
opted for globalisation and have embraced the market economy. In India, the marketing scenario has
changed dramatically since 1991, with international players entering the market with better brands
and ostensibly better products. It is the lure of foreign goods that tempts most Indians. Besides, with
the partial convertibility of Rupee, Indian companies fi nd marketing overseas lucrative as well as an
excellent image-building venture.
<p>India has been fl ooded with so many international players that for some, even survival has become
a diffi cult task. If these companies are guided properly, they can plan overseas marketing; while at
times even hitting the foreign companies that have taken over their market share in their home
countries in a fashion by organising Cross Parry. (Cross Parry can be defi ned as taking action against
competition by hitting them in their strongholds.)
<p>Some Defi nitions
<p>For the purpose of this book the following defi nitions would hold good:
<p>Home country: The country whose company wants to go for overseas marketing.
Host country: The country where the company wants to market its products.
<p>In the last century, especially the period before 1991, Indian companies found the local markets
profi table, growing and with low levels of competition. Surprisingly, in spite of the various in-
centives like cash incentives (provided to help Indian exporters match international prices), duty
drawbacks (which are still given to cover customs duty, excise duty and the like), and replenishment
licences, most companies preferred to operate only in the Indian markets.
<p>However, since 1991, with the changes being brought about by the policies of the government, Indian
business and industry have woken up to the realities of international marketing and their associated
challenges. Companies have realised that no country can remain in isolation or as an island.
<p>Companies have to take the following decisions as they plan international marketing:
<p>1. Countries they want to do business with.
2. The level of involvement they want to have with respect to fi nancial, human, managerial and
<p>technological inputs in the host country.
3. The marketing organisation best suited to the host country.
4. Advertising and promotional plans.
5. Selection of the distribution channels.
6. Optimising resource usage (human resources, fi nance, information and technology) with better
<p>allocation and monitoring.
7. Global or multi-domestic management positioning.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING CONCEPTS
<p>Companies venturing into international marketing have to decide which of the following plans they
want to implement in the host country:
<p>1. Ethnocentric
2. Polycentric
3. Region-centric
4. Geocentric
<p>Ethnocentric plans take into account only the host country&rsquo;s cultural ambience, while polycentric
plans consider the cultural values of both the host country and the home country. Region-centric plans
consider the culture only of the region in which the company is operating and a geocentric view takes
the cultural ethos of the geographic coverage the company plans to have.
<p>GOING INTERNATIONAL
<p>Companies need to operate within a general environment framework as follows:
<p>1. Demographic
2. Social
3. Cultural
4. Political
5. Legal
6. Macroeconomic
7. Technology
8. Global
<p>These factors need to be studied, assessed, screened and monitored in the context of the host
country for correct planning of marketing strategies.
<p>Demographic Factors
<p>Demographic data like population dispersion in towns and villages, income levels of families, sex
ratios and affi liations to religious groups are available through the census of the host country. Shifts of
population from villages to towns, from small towns to metro towns provide business opportunities,
which no marketer can afford to miss. For a start, shifts in population indicate a need for low-cost
housing, clothing, transportation, eateries and the like.
<p>Social Factors
<p>Social factors like the increase in the number of working women in towns at all levels of income have
given rise to a big boost in the demand for time-saving equipments like washing machines, vacuum </p>
<br>

<p>cleaners, microwave ovens and precooked foods. As women are coming out of homes, better dresses,
cosmetics, health gyms are required. With families earning a double income, leisure time activity
products, holiday packages and travel are becoming fast growing sectors.
<p>Cultural Factors
<p>India is a land of rich cultural heritage. Marketeers and advertisers take full advantage of the knowledge
of the buying season in different parts of the country. During Deepavali, Hindus buy new clothes,
household articles and exchange gifts. Muslims do the same around Eid, while Christians shop a lot
around Christmas. The cultural ethos provides innumerable themes for promoting sales. India is a
vast country, where more than 20 languages are spoken. It is home to several religions and varied
cultures and subcultures. For example, in Punjab, there is a Punjabi culture and within it is the Sikh
subculture. Karnataka has a Kannad culture, while the Coorg District within Karnataka has its
own subculture.
<p>Political Factors
<p>It was the political will of the government that led to liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation
in 1991. The infl ux of foreign capital, setting up of manufacturing bases and joint ventures all sprung
up from then onwards. Changes in the cash reserve ratio, taxation rates and duties are the political
factors that have a major impact on business.
<p>Legal Factors
<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s directives have made car manufacturers adopt the emission standards to
Euro II. Diesel buses are on their way out in Delhi for the same reason. Ignoring the law of the land
can be detrimental to the interests of fi rms operating in the country.
<p>Macroeconomic Factors
<p>The interest rates, taxes and duties, the balance of payment situation of the countries that the fi rms
want to do business with, fl uctuations in foreign currency rates and the like are all macroeconomic
factors that have a major impact on business and they must be well understood by business houses.
<p>Technology Factors
<p>In the past decade, information technology, telecommunication, biotechnology and genetic engineering
have revolutionised the business scene in India and abroad.</p>

<p>International Marketing Management22
<p>Global Factors
<p>With the breaking of the Berlin Wall, the reunifi cation of Germany, the breaking up of the USSR, and
more recently, the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, the Indian Parliament, and the
liberation of Afghanistan, have affected business worldwide and most countries are trying to recover
the lost ground. On the brighter side, developments in the area of medicine, agriculture, farming and
cloning have helped the world take big strides towards a better future for its children.
<p>Companies face certain basic situations as they plan international marketing. Some situations arise
from within the company while others from outside:
<p>1. Company-specifi c problems:
<p> Fear of the unknown.
Reluctance to go international because of a good domestic market.
Lack of resources; fi nancial, manpower or information problems.
The company&rsquo;s inability to face international competition in the host countries.
<p>2. Government barriers:
<p> Host country regulations like stringent laws regarding international investments (this was
the case in India prior to 1991) that discourage companies.
<p> Tariff barriers.
<p>Companies face competitive environment factors that can be seen with the help of Michael Porter&rsquo;s
Five Force Model.
<p>COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
<p>Let us discuss the competitive business environment with the help of Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five Force
Model (see Figure 1.1).
<p>Figure 1.1 Five Force Model
<p>Threat of new entrants
<p>Bargaining power of suppliers Rivalry among existing players Bargaining power of buyers
<p>Threat of substitute products
<p>Rivalry among existing players: The most important factor a company must deal with is the exist-
ing competition. Over the past decade, this has become a very important issue for Indian companies
as competition has increased severalfold. Marketeers in India enjoyed a virtual oligopoly situation in
most products till the epoch making year 1991, when the government opened up the country&rsquo;s economy
to foreign players. The severity of competition is manifested in the innovations brought about in the
marketing mix by most fi rms. Foreign players have brought with them the latest technology, well-
known brands and management skills. However, they lack basic information about Indian buyers,
their culture and mindsets. Indian fi rms can, therefore, make use of this intrinsic weakness in the
foreign players and gain an advantage over them.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 23
<p>1. Bargaining power of suppliers:
<p> When there are several suppliers of undifferentiated products and a few buyer fi rms (like
suppliers of nuts and bolts), the buyers have the bargaining power and the large volume
buyer gets a better price as quantity discount.
<p> When the suppliers are limited and there are several buyers, the bargaining power shifts
to the suppliers as then the suppliers can pick and choose their buyers on the basis of their
purchase value, proximity and adherence to payment schedules.
<p> When the suppliers are limited but make unique products for a particular fi rm (like car seat
manufacturers), the buyers have the power to the extent that the supplier has to conform
to the standards and delivery norms of the buyer fi rm. As there are no other buyers for the
product, they can acquire bargaining power by cornering the fi rm into a tight supply position
and the fi rm will accept any terms of business as long as it can keep its production going.
<p> When the supplier is a part of the fi rm&rsquo;s own group, the bargaining power is decided by
the head of the group, who then has to make a decision about profi t distribution among the
various members of the group.
<p>2. Bargaining power of buyers:
<p> The customer gets his power to bargain when there are several fi rms supplying the same
product and the customer gets his choice of buying from any one of the sellers.
<p> When the product demand is in the growth stage of the product life cycle and entry barriers
like high investment costs or government restrictions are few, then newcomers fi nd it diffi cult
to start business in that area and in that product.
<p> Threats to the product may come from substitute products. For example, paint manufacturers
may face competition from manufacturers of chuna, wallpaper, cement and wood panelling.
<p>In order to effectively counter the problems faced by fi rms on account of changes in business general
environment factors and competitive environment factors, they must carry out market research/scan
continuously in order to have accurate information about the international market at all times.
<p>Most Indian companies that are doing well in the local market are concerned about the response
they will have in the overseas markets. This fear can be removed by getting market surveys done to
locate the market position including the competition, tariff and non-tariff barriers to their entry in the
host-country market. Indian private companies plan international marketing purely for profi t motives.
However, it must be understood that companies must remain patient as profi ts in the international
markets may come slowly because of the unknown and unexpected business environment that
may be prevailing there. In international marketing, perseverance pays as fast growing companies
disappear fast too.
<p>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION
<p>Companies planning to go international must take international competition into account. With
many countries joining the market economy, most countries face severe competition in their markets
with several players in the fi eld. While the WTO has been trying to arrange a level-playing fi eld for
the various companies, there are basic advantages that certain companies and certain countries enjoy.
Companies with high international brand equity like Coke and Pepsi in soft drinks and Mercedes
in cars are recognised as major brands the world over. Others, therefore, fi nd it diffi cult to compete
with these brands.</p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management24
<p>Applying seventeenth century law on competition by Adam Smith, it can be reiterated that com-
panies and countries that have absolute advantage in terms of low-cost production will gain ground.
However, in the twenty-fi rst century, other factors like comparative advantage rather than absolute
advantage take precedence. Comparative advantage comes from cost leadership gained through
economies of scale, experience curve and better technology. Better maintenance of manufacturing
equipment reduces time and adds to the lowering of cost. Market response and quick redressal of
complaints create competitive advantage for companies.
<p>&lsquo;Vasudhaiv Kutumbhkam&rsquo; (the world is one family) aptly describes the business world of the
twenty-fi rst century. With supersonic jets, travel time has been drastically reduced. The internet,
fax and cell phones have made communication as fast as anybody can want. The fl ow of technology,
fi nance and market information has become rapid, making it easier to plan global business. It, how-
ever, has opened the doors to a wide range of countries, creating severe international competition in
practically all areas of business. There have been international or multinational fi rms in India for a
long time now like the Lever Brothers, Shell, Exxon, Ford, Nestl&eacute;. Today, a much larger contingent of
fi rms is either already in the market or is entering it to vie for the customers. There is hardly a nation
left which is not a player in the international arena. It depends on the supply&ndash;demand paradigm,
which decides the supply point, while the economic levels of the countries defi ne the product demand
support and the product sales in different countries.
<p>International marketing helps companies in expanding their sales with benefi ts accruing in terms
of foreign currency for themselves and for their country. Of late, several countries, including India,
have liberalised their trade policies. Technological advances have helped in bringing about improve-
ments in manufacturing processes that have helped products achieve international quality standards.
The UN organisations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the WTO
assist companies in establishing international trade.
<p>Companies need to assess their core competencies with respect to the requirements in the overseas
markets and dovetail the same for obtaining the maximum advantage from them. The conditions in
the host countries, and their economic, cultural and political ambience should be studied thoroughly
for best results. Companies start with exporting their products, and as they succeed they get into
strategic alliances with groups in the host countries to further expand their trade.
<p>Multinational corporations take the global marketing scenario into account as due to their fi nancial
muscle, they can pick and choose the most appropriate country to do business with. However, all com-
panies, both fi rst-time exporters and even well-established MNCs have to learn about the following
areas of the host country in order to ensure the success of their business:
<p>1. Social environment
2. Political environment
3. The legal system and laws on business, trade and commerce
4. Economic situation
5. The consumer behaviour
6. Its geography
7. Its historical past
<p>International marketing provides a company with an inbuilt force that propels it to achieve better
technology, quality standards and fi nance that spin-off in the domestic markets as well giving the
company an edge over competitors. The forces that impede the company&rsquo;s progress in the international
markets are discussed next:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 25
<p>1. Unfavourable governmental attitudes and policies towards foreign companies.
2. Cross-national treaties, economic pacts and bilateral agreements on trade.
3. Strong acceptance in the host country of another country&rsquo;s products.
<p>The following factors drive companies into expanding in international markets:
<p>1. Excess production capacity beyond the home-country&rsquo;s demand.
2. Low production costs including the cost of labour.
3. Low cost of materials along with easy availability.
4. Proximity to international markets.
5. Government regulations encouraging international marketing, like incentives.
<p>As is evident, the drivers are specifi c both to companies as well as to a country&rsquo;s business
environment.
<p>Companies planning international marketing need to assess the norms of consumer behaviour
of the host country. Countries have different geographic positions in the world. Some are large
countries with a variety of religions, cultural ethos and languages, like India. Companies need to
understand the diversity as also the similarities that exist in a country&rsquo;s social milieu. Culture can
be described as the behaviour of the people arising out of their learned attitudes, value base, beliefs
and the country&rsquo;s traditions. The host country would have differences in these areas from the home
country. A country&rsquo;s culture is based on its tradition, history and the unique character of its social
ethos. There are groups in each culture that emanate from similarity in family status, gender group-
ings, age, religion, political preferences, professional bodies, racial groups, ethnic groups and a certain
degree of economic resources, prestige, status and authority from position. These groups tend to
orient the buyer&rsquo;s behaviour in any given society. Companies need to build their own parameters
for the culture of each country where they operate or want to do business with. Therefore, operating
with a geocentric approach rather than a polycentric or ethnocentric approach would be the best
alternative. In other words, the best way is to locate the best of the centralised and decentralised
system of working. Business practices adopted by successful companies worldwide would succeed
only if they take into account the cultural factors of the home country along with those of the culture
of host country. The required level of cultural understanding of the host country would depend on
the penetration planned by the company in the host country. The company may have to plan new
strategies to suit the host country and it would depend on the cost of the change and the benefi ts
that might accrue as a result of the changes.
<p>As the market economy spreads in different countries and a number of companies start international
operations, some mingling of cultural streams is bound to happen. India has witnessed a cultural
revolution on account of the invasion of foreign fi lms, television channels and foreign companies that
have brought in expatriates into the country.
<p>ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF HOST COUNTRIES
<p>It is necessary to understand the economic environment of the countries you want to do business in.
The main indicators of the economic environment of a country are its gross domestic product (GDP),
per capita income, rate of infl ation and productivity levels. There are low income, medium income </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management26
<p>and rich countries, and developing and developed countries. While population can be an indicator of
product demand, it could be too simplistic as in developing countries the population could be large
and yet demand for luxury products could be low.
<p>Countries can be divided into three categories with respect to their economic systems:
<p>1. Market economy: Here individual private companies control and allocate resources.
2. Totalitarian economy: Here the government controls the resources.
3. Mixed economy: In a mixed economy, there is both private and government ownership and
<p>control of the resources.
<p>While most countries have opted for market economy, a few pockets with a communist control on
the governments still have a totalitarian economy, for example, Cuba. India had a mixed economy
till 1991 when it decided to join the market economy in phases, with the government starting the
economic reforms called LPG, that is liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation of the economy.
China has had a long period of communist regime but for the last 20 years or so it has changed into
a market economy. Russia too has come out of the communist way of life.
<p>In a market economy, the consumer is supreme as he dictates what products are needed and,
therefore, he decides what is sold, the levels and quality of production. Governmental controls are
minimal in such economies. Twenty per cent of the total countries having 15 per cent of the world&rsquo;s
population, that accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the gross national product (GNP). These rich
countries are more dependent on industry and services and less on their agriculture produce. The
duality of their business behaviour can be seen from the following statements. These rich countries
have to depend on the less rich or the developing countries for marketing their products. However,
surprisingly, the rich countries place artifi cial barriers on the export of products by developing
countries by way of quota systems. The WTO has been trying to provide an easy access to markets
around the world for the developing countries but with little success.
<p>Countries can be classifi ed as developed or developing depending on their income levels. Some
of the Asian countries like India and China are developing on a fast track. Product demand is
dependent on the population of the countries and their per capita incomes. The other variables of
product demand are:
<p>1. Climatic conditions
2. Education levels
3. Religions practised
4. Cultural ethos
5. Political stability
<p>The high-income developing countries are trying to privatise government-owned companies.
At the same time, the poor countries need to export for repayment of their external debts, which leaves
little foreign exchange earnings for their developmental work.
<p>The former USSR has broken up and present-day Russia is trying to balance the conservative
government controls with transition towards a market economy. China has been transformed into
a dynamic market-controlled country. There has been a decentralisation of economic decisions and
money has been coming in from the overseas Chinese.
<p>The importance of international marketing has never been felt in India with such intensity as today.
With increasing international competition on our shores, Indian fi rms have to compete with them and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 27
<p>fi nd other markets as well. With the partial convertibility of Rupee, export earnings have become a
major source of foreign exchange, which helps fi rm&rsquo;s import raw materials and components. Now
even completely built units are allowed to be imported and many fi rms are using these benefi ts to
import samples for user trials and sales. Firms have to fi nd markets overseas to survive in the Indian
market. It is also true that fi rst the product must be proven in the Indian market before fi rms venture
out for its export, unless of course, the product has been manufactured with the foreign customers&rsquo;
specifi cations and requirements in mind.
<p>Our manufacturers have been, by and large, handicapped in the world market, with a few ex-
ceptions, because of the following reasons:
<p> 1. Indian products have low brand equity. Foreigners consider them to be of low quality.
2. Our advertising in the world market is below the mark.
3. Our embassies need to do much more to promote Indian products.
4. India has been considered a country of snake charmers and elephant rides, a land of maharajas.
<p>This image needs to be changed.
5. Our knowledge about the world market is restricted to traditional products and traditional
<p>markets. We need to widen our product range as also our geographic world coverage.
6. Till the 1980s, fi rms in India found that the home market was more attractive and they had
<p>no reason to go overseas.
7. Surprisingly, perhaps, it was some small fi rms, which ventured into exports and built a name
<p>for themselves.
8. With Rupee value in favour of exports, now is the time to take full advantage of the situation.
9. India has low cost of labour, which can make our top quality products very competitive.
10. To a new exporter, international business remains a mystery until he ventures out and fi nds
<p>out the benefi ts and methods of going overseas.
<p>BRAND INDIA
<p>Brand India needs to be nurtured and developed in a major way and only that will ensure rapid
development of international markets for Indian companies. A few years ago, the Government of
India started activities on building Brand India, but somehow the initiative got lost due to change in
the government at the Centre.
<p>The easy and most suitable way of doing international business is to look at the international market
as it is done for the local market. The following factors about the general business environment need
to be considered for conducting business:
<p>1. Demographics: This gives a population profi le in terms of income, age, sex, languages spoken,
religions followed, urban, semi-urban, rural population of the host country, and seasonal
and permanent migration patterns. These factors help in understanding the product demand
patterns.
<p>2. Socio-cultural factors: These give information on areas like health awareness, educational
standards, population of working women, family size and festive seasons. These are also very
helpful in determining product demand patterns. For example, Deepavali and Eid in India are
periods of massive purchases by households.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management28
<p>3. Political-legal factors: The political system of the country, the number of political parties, the
form of the government (that is, whether it is a monarchy or democracy), legal restrictions and
aids to business, especially foreign fi rms are all important political and legal factors.
<p>4. Technology: The level of technology available in a fi rm&rsquo;s area of interest, the speed of technology
upgradation and research and development (R&amp;D) efforts going on in the country are import-
ant technological factors.
<p>5. Macro-economic factors: These factors deal with tariffs, levies and taxes, balance of payment
between the countries and interest rates for borrowing.
<p>6. Global factors: These provide information about the business globalisation process going on in
the host country.
<p>7. Governmental view: How the country&rsquo;s government views foreign investments and entry of
foreign goods into their country? Do they have a long-range perspective on foreign fi rms? How
are expatriate business people treated in the country are important factors.
<p>Companies should understand the competitive environment factors also in order to plan proactive
activities to counter competition or put it in its place. Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five Force Model should be
used to gain knowledge on competition in the country (see Figure 1.1).
<p>A detailed discussion on the subject can be found in Chapter 14 (&lsquo;Market Competitive Forces
Worldwide&rsquo;).
<p>Companies wanting to do overseas business should understand the competitor&rsquo;s 4Ps&mdash;product,
price, placement and promotion. This is to ensure that apples are compared with apples only and
not with oranges. The fi rm must know who the competitors are, which of their products are in com-
petition with their own products and the benefi ts the competitors offer to the customers in their
product offerings.
<p>After doing the analyses, the fi rm should take a look at its own strengths and weaknesses vis-&agrave;-vis
the competition and then take the following decisions:
<p>1. To go overseas or not.
2. If yes, which market or markets to enter and the priority of the markets selected.
3. The methods of entering the market&mdash;through direct sales to customers, through channels,
<p>having own outlets, franchisee operations or even having own production overseas. Production
could be from component stage, semi-knocked down product assemblies or import of completely
built units.
<p>4. Having own offi ces and sales channels under direct control.
5. Technology transfers to local business/industry.
6. Deciding on the marketing programme, including market share to be captured, marketing
<p>expense to be incurred.
7. Deciding on the marketing organisational set-up.
<p>Managers must be aware of the complexities in international business. The following need to be
considered:
<p>1. Global perspectives: Is their product acceptable in the global market or does it need any
modifi cations to ensure its acceptance?
<p>2. Options available for differentiating the product.
3. Possible strategies for pricing and distribution.
4. International marketing and government relations.
5. Advantages accruing to the fi rm from international marketing. </p>

<br>
<p>International Marketing 29
<p>International marketing helps tide over problems that may arise while doing business in one
market only. It becomes an insurance against political risks as well. However, companies should well
understand the cultural diversities of different countries. Cultural differences can be converted to a
company&rsquo;s advantage by positioning products as attractive ethnic ones.
<p>Three strategies possible in international marketing are given below:
<p>1. Global
2. Multi-domestic
3. Hybrid
<p>In the global strategy, the fi rm adapts its international market planning on the lines of its single
global strategy. The Mercedes car remains the same all over the world. There is no change in its mar-
keting plans as well. The Lever Brothers, however, have different products, brands and other marketing
features specifi c to each country. This is called a multi-domestic strategy. A combination of the two
is the hybrid strategy.
<p>Firms that have a universally accepted product with a known brand, like Coke, Mercedes, Toyota,
have a global marketing policy, as the product remains the same the world over. However, fi rms with
products where the tastes of the consumers differ from country to country, use the multi-domestic
policy. In this case, they change the product specifi cations, pricing policy and advertising according
to local conditions and tastes. Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) fi rms like Unilever, Proctor &amp;
Gamble follow this strategy.
<p>The most popular strategy is the hybrid one, where fi rms use a global product, but change its
advertising and promotion to suit the local conditions. Even Coke changes its advertising and
promotion to suit the target country while keeping the product the same universally.
<p>Levi&rsquo;s jeans is the standard uniform for workers in the US, while in France, Italy and India, it is a
fashion statement. Mercedes cars are mostly used as taxis in Germany, while it is considered a status
symbol in the rest of the world.
<p>Bar codes have made a global presence, for example, the Levi&rsquo;s link system helps their retailers the
world over to &lsquo;transfer, record sales and control inventories&rsquo; with the use of these codes.
<p>If value is added in upstream activities like commercial aircrafts, it is global strategy. If the value
is added in downstream activities like housing or prepared food, it is multi-domestic strategy.
<p>In most countries, foreign fi rms can get competitive advantage by having quality relations with
the government.
<p>The advantages of global or international marketing for India are as follows:
<p>1. It can leverage our low labour cost as a cost leadership advantage vis-&agrave;-vis the competition.
2. It can get foreign exchange as per the partial convertibility of Rupee.
<p>The disadvantages of international marketing are:
<p>1. Currency changes (exchange rate fl uctuations).
2. The host country&rsquo;s strategies vis-&agrave;-vis foreign fi rms.
3. Lack of international experience.
<p>The home country can develop a competitive edge with process improvement plans and with the
help of total customer management as discussed next.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management30
<p>CORE PROCESS REENGINEERING (CPR) AND
TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM)
<p>A fi rm&rsquo;s process-executing capabilities are a fundamental source of enhancing its competitive
advantage. They are akin to tending the trees, where deep digging is required for watering the roots.
Hence, operational strategies must be treated as an integral and important part of strategic man-
agement. Firms can improve their process capabilities through core process reengineering CPR and
TQM. Operations or production&rsquo;s role is in evolving capabilities through people and processes as against
through products and processes.
<p>TQM improves the processes from the lowest level upwards, while CPR brings about radical changes
from top down. It starts with training of the workers, maybe one day in a week as it is time consuming;
it should be considered an investment by the management in improving the processes. The Japanese
have developed quality circles, which are groups of workers working as a team who meet periodically
to discuss quality issues facing them to fi nd solutions jointly. These meeting are structured as they
have a formal agenda and minutes are kept for reference and review at a later date.
<p>The following are the similarities between TQM and CPR:
<p>1. Both improve processes for customer value.
2. Both improve quality, cost and speed of the processes.
3. Both are based on a systems view (a non-systems view would be improving individual process
<p>only).
At the Nippon Electric Glass (NEG) plant in Japan, television picture tubes are produced from
<p>silica or sand. Silica is converted into glass, which is then given the shape of the tube via three
parts, the face plate, the funnel and the neck. These are then processed through vacuum and
the electronic gun is then fi xed. The entire process is carried out in one factory.
<p> Individual workers having quality problems with a process are either re-trained to do a
better job or if required, the process itself is changed or modifi ed. In CPR, the entire system is
altered.
<p>4. Both cover inter and intra organisational boundaries as they involve suppliers and customers.
5. Both aim at the best in class benchmarking with the ideal process.
<p>The following are the differences between CPR and TQM:
<p>1. Approach: In CPR, the management has to imagine and reach through their vision while TQM
improves what the fi rm already possesses.
<p>2. Scope and Scoring: TQM improves in small stages (like single runs in cricketing parlance) while
CPR improves the entire organisation radically.
<p>3. Design: TQM modifi es the existing design while CPR changes the design.
4. Movement of the changed process: In TQM the movement is from the lowest level to the highest
<p>while the movement in CPR is from top management down to the worker level.
5. Involvement level: In TQM, the entire organisation gets involved while in CPR, only the top
<p>management is involved as it deals with huge investments by the fi rm.
<p>Both CPR and TQM are means of improving the customer value of the product and must, therefore,
complement each other.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 31
<p>The following are the guidelines for CPR and TQM management:
<p>1. Both must be tuned to the fi rm&rsquo;s broad strategies.
2. They must be adjusted to the core competencies of the fi rm.
3. The means of achieving the process improvement must not lose sight of the ultimate objective
<p>of the exercise.
4. For both, time and money are required; the requirement of money is much more for CPR.
<p>Usually fi rms select a process, then to improve it they use TQM till there is no further room for
improvement and the saturation point is reached. At this point, the fi rms select a new process through
CPR and again the new process is improved through TQM. This is shown in Figure 1.2.
<p>Figure 1.2 CPR and TQM: Process Improvement
<p>The horizontal lines depict CPR while the slanted lines are showing improvements through
TQM.
<p>In formulating strategies, fi rms have to decide the improvement they are looking for, the competitive
advantage they are seeking. This would help fi rms in taking a generic process and redesigning it
through benchmarking it to match with its expectations on improvements.
<p>Firms face one major diffi culty in implementing CPR. At the time when the fi rst process reaches
its saturation point, if it is stopped before starting the second process, fi rms face loss of production
and may lose the market. Hence, they try to introduce the second process while the fi rst is still
operating. When both processes are in operation together, production tends to drop due to Crazy
Time, as shown in Figure 1.3.
<p>As shown in Figure 1.3, the fi rst process P1 is still operating when P2 is introduced. The time
between the two process overlap, between the thick triple lines is crazy time as, unless the fi rm takes
good care to minimise the confusion, it becomes really diffi cult for the fi rm.
<p>Benchmarking helps the fi rm both in TQM and CPR, as while in TQM the results are benchmarked
with the help of industrial engineering work-studies, for CPR the entire business and economic
environments are seen for functional benchmarking.
<p>The differences between TQM and CPR can be summarised as given in Table 1.1</p>
<br>

<p>1. People&rsquo;s involvement in the process changes is absolutely imperative. The following is the
plan for the people&rsquo;s involvement: The top management is required to set the improvement
objectives, select the teams for improvement in execution, monitor results, solve problems in
the way of the changes planned.
<p>2. Middle managers coordinate between internal customers and plan makers, support change
implementation, reorganise and plan redeployment of resources.
<p>3. Evaluation managers must have benchmarks, critical paths and timetable to assess the progress
as also benchmarks for quality of change.
<p>4. It is important to have trainers to assist the teams and to guide them in the right direction for
proper time management and quality of work.
<p>TOTAL CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT (TCM)
<p>Firms are geared up to provide customer satisfaction. However, if a fi rm can give the real value the
customers are looking for or which would be of value to them even if they are currently not aware
of the product, the fi rm can go far ahead of the competition. (While buying a motorcycle, a customer

<p>would value reliability, ease of driving and a hassle-free product more than anything else. However,
trade-offs may be needed to provide low-cost benefi t and some features may have to be removed or
given as optional at a price.)
<p>Customer surveys often give a glimpse of the real needs of customers, when unaided responses
are called for, and those provide the information about what the customers would value most in the
product. While the complexities of production are the manufacturers&rsquo; problems, if these lead to ease
of product usage by the customers these should be welcomed.
<p>Customers&rsquo; perceived value comes through the product, service, sales personnel, delivery in
case of consumer goods while for industrial goods the value comes from the product in addition to
maintenance, installation, commissioning, training of the customers&rsquo; engineering staff, billing, credit
period and the sales staff of the fi rm.
<p>Firms should plan products for the entire life cycle of the product. The product should provide the
customer with value rather than just customer satisfaction. There are new products, which the customer
would want if they knew about the existence of the product. Cell phones are the best example. When
they were not available and customers did not know about them, there was no demand. Once they
came into existence, the demand shot up like magic.
<p>Firms need to have a balanced view of manufacturing costs and the benefi ts of providing variety
and complexity. Products that are diffi cult to use should either be withdrawn or should come with
detailed instructions for customers about their use and benefi ts.
<p>Firms should ensure supplies of raw materials and components through strategic alliances with
major suppliers. They should keep a balance between standard mass production and customised
production (Maruti cars are mass-produced and yet on customers&rsquo; demand they can modify the cars
like giving better seats, and openable and retractable roofs). Companies would benefi t by having lean
operation practices by avoiding or reducing non-value-adding work.
<p>Firms take the following route to international business:
<p>Figure 1.4 International Business Route
<p>Note: &lowast; Wholly-owned subsidiary.
<p>As can be seen in Figure 1.4, fi rms normally start by exporting. This is followed by licensing the
manufacture of the product or its sale. Next comes franchise operation where the local businessman
franchisee can use the brand name of the fi rm and get managerial support. On being successful, the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management34
<p>fi rm can start a joint venture manufacturing unit and fi nally, the fi rm can have its own manufacturing
organisation to manufacture and market products in the host as well as other countries. Firms can enter
new international markets from any place depending on their own plans and the host government&rsquo;s
rules and regulations.
<p>Companies have to decide the markets they want to enter internationally. The three markets that
cater to the major part of international business are the European, the US and the Far East. The decision
to enter a particular market should be made on the basis of the host country&rsquo;s policy on foreign fi rms
and its economic standards. Distances become important as freight of goods to be exported is dependent
on it. India as a market has looked attractive to the western nations due to its large population, which
consists of nearly 200 million people belonging to the consumer group.
<p>Seeing the importance of inter-country trade, several geographic economic blocks or zones have been
formed to not only do easy and free business with one another but also to put barriers for outsiders
from doing business with them.
<p>FREE TRADE ZONES
<p>Some of the free trade zones are listed next:
<p>1. European Union: The European Union (EU) has recently introduced a common currency, the
Euro, with the help of which the countries of Europe can do business with each other without
any tax levies or other type of barriers. Most of the European countries are members of the
EU. Some like the United Kingdom (UK) have not fully accepted the idea yet and have kept
their own currency, the Pound, as valid tender for business within and overseas. With nearly
400 million consumers in the EU, they amount to more than 20 per cent of world trade. The EU
offers a large market to other countries, including India, due to its volume of requirements.
However, its economic scales of manufacture create threats with power costs. India should
take advantage of its low cost of labour and get into the EU market.
<p>2. North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): NAFTA is a free trade zone for the US, Canada
and Mexico, with 365 million consumers. Trading with the US has its limitations due to their
quota system in their import of textiles. Inter-country trade has no barriers, which creates
barriers for outsiders.
<p>3. Mercosur: This is a free trade zone joining Brazil, Columbia and Mexico. Venezuela, Columbia,
and Mexico&mdash;the Group of Three&mdash;are forming a free trade zone and these could all join
NAFTA.
<p>4. Association for South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC): These are other attempts at forming free trade zones and only time will
tell if they are successful.
<p>Market evaluation is done on the basis of proximity also. For example, the US sells the maximum
part of its produce to Canada, its immediate neighbour.
<p>International marketing starts as exports to other countries. In India, in the 1960s, fi rms found that
their local market was not expanding to the expected level and that they had surplus products. It was
enough to spur these fi rms to try and enter the export trade. However, once the Indian market came
up, these fi rms diverted export goods in the then more lucrative local market. This inconsistency
of supplies, which was sporadic at times, did no good to the fi rms or to the country&rsquo;s export effort. </p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Marketing 35
<p>Firms had to build export production capacities. Bajaj Motors did this and they reaped the
harvest in terms of export earnings and long-range benefi ts. Some exporting organisations after
their initial success, started exporting products of several manufacturers to different countries.
The small-scale industry was the fi rst to take up the challenge of exporting goods from India. Ex-
ports help in gaining economies of scale, improving quality to international levels and also help in
Cross Parry.
<p>Some companies, like Bajaj, took up direct exports and they could select from one of the following
routes:
<p>1. Exports through the local export department of the fi rm
2. Overseas branches
3. Export through travelling sales persons
4. Foreign distribution networks
5. Overseas liaison offi ces
6. Indian embassies
7. Foreign buyers coming to India
8. Agents of foreign buyers in India
<p>The normal methods of entering the arena of international marketing are discussed next.
<p>LICENSING
<p>The next level of international marketing is through licensing. In this phase, the fi rm gets into overseas
business by giving its technology, trade name, brand and process of manufacturing against a fee
and/or royalty to a local fi rm of the country the fi rm wants to do business with. The fi rm gains entry
in the foreign market without much investment. The fi rm taking the license gets the technology to
manufacture a well-known brand in the world, a proven technology. India has had a number of such
arrangements so far, including Maruti Suzuki, Alcatel-Modi. Some survived the open market economy
of the country while others were bought out by the licensors.
<p>The failure to survive can be attributed to the following:
<p>1. Low control of the licensor over the local operations.
2. Sale of some vital components by the licensor to the fi rm at high prices to make extra profi ts
<p>thereby reducing margins for the fi rm.
3. Licensing done without looking at the synergy between the two fi rms.
4. Distrust between the two partners.
<p>FRANCHISING
<p>This is a more detailed and complete form of licensing. The franchiser provides all the product
marketing concepts brand building plans and marketing processes. The fi rm pays the franchiser a fee
and invests in the venture. The Mcdonald&rsquo;s franchise arrangement is one such example.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management36
<p>JOINT VENTURES
<p>In joint ventures, two fi rms, one local and the other foreign join hands and they form a third company
to exploit the strengths of the respective fi rms. This form of doing business became expedient for
entering some countries as the governments of those countries were opposed to foreign equity
beyond a certain level. Joint ventures can face problems because of the cultural differences between
the two partners. Problems can also arise if there is a mismatch of the level of expertise required for
absorbing the technology of the foreign fi rm, a difference of opinion regarding the running of the
fi rm or fi nancial disagreements.
<p>FULLY-OWNED FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY
<p>This is usually the last step and is taken after the fi rm has been in the foreign market for some time
and has established itself there. It is dependent on the local government&rsquo;s policy with respect to
investments by foreign fi rms in the country. Countries like India and China have been the focus of
the western world as these countries are welcoming foreign direct investments (FDI).
<p>OVERVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETING
<p>Firms that do not take full advantage of global opportunities will in time lose their home base and
might get taken over by strong foreign players. International marketing focuses a fi rm&rsquo;s resources
and its objectives on international opportunities. Each fi rm has some driving and stimulating forces in
this regard as also some restraining forces, like laidback ideas, rigidity of views, fear of the unknown.
The fact, however, remains that the international market provides enormous potential for business.
Overall, it is the place of perfect competition&mdash;there are lots of sellers and lots of buyers too. Products
sold can be undifferentiated products like ores and raw materials (which are sold on the basis of price
only). With differentiated or branded products, fi rms charge higher prices and they sell these products
on the basis of their brand equity the world over.
<p>Countries differ from each other in terms of their wealth, GNP, per capita income, education levels,
religious beliefs, size and their ethnicity. Firms planning global marketing must understand the host
country&rsquo;s human resources, economics, politics and social situations.
<p>Major assumptions in international trade are discussed next:
<p>1. Environment is a determinant in international marketing. Geography, distances and climatic
conditions have an impact on business.
<p>2. Scientifi c and industrial revolutions help the fi rms to make things happen even when the
environmental factors are not conducive. Technology helps in doing more with less effort.
<p>3. The ways in which fi rms do business and produce goods are different in different parts of the
world.
<p>4. The statement that, &lsquo;the fi rm&rsquo;s own country is the best for business&rsquo; may not remain true with
fi rms facing international competition from better products.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 37
<p>We can thus conclude that the trend in growth in world business is a result of the interaction of
specifi c driving and restraining forces. The driving forces must overcome the restraining forces.
<p>Let us discuss the driving force in world business. Mainly we can see the supply and demand
situation and the gap therein. New products, newer needs of old products and worldwide com-
munication links like television and the internet have fuelled the world of business as follows:
<p>1. Worldwide TV networks and the internet have driven the markets. Product information, its
usage and advantages are now known the world over through these media.
<p>2. Technology helps in reducing human drudgery. Products like washing machines, vacuum
cleaners and microwave ovens are ample proof in this regard.
<p>3. The cost of the product is usually of vital interest to the customer. Low-cost manufacture with
the help of economies of scale, experience curve or better technology all help a fi rm in becoming
more competitive.
<p>4. The quality of the products should meet or exceed the customer&rsquo;s requirements. With global
sales, fi rms achieve economies of scale and with large volumes of production, costs come down
while the quality remains the same. Small manufacturers have to compromise on quality to
reduce the price or organise trade-offs.
<p>5. Improvement in communication and transportation technology has broadened the market-
place as products get known, are demanded and can be transported speedily with modern fast
aircrafts.
<p>6. A fi rm/country&rsquo;s expertise gets it the right leverage in the international market as is the case
for India in the fi eld of software technology.
<p>Coming to the restraining forces in the world market, they are:
<p>1. Historical demand of the product in the local market.
2. Competition from the countries&rsquo; own business enterprises.
3. Management myopia may be another restraining force. Firms may have short-sighted managers
<p>who consider that the profi t from the country&rsquo;s market should be enough impetus and going
global would be a waste of time and money.
<p>4. A fi rm&rsquo;s organisational culture can at times restrict operations overseas. Many large Indian
companies did not want to go overseas as a personal philosophy.
<p>5. International barriers are also restraining forces. Some countries do not encourage outsiders to
come to their country and do business there.
<p>Today the international market has progressed because the driving forces are more dominant
than the restraining forces. In spite of this, there are two different kinds of fi rms:
<p>1. In the fi rst kind of fi rm, the marketing manager decides on the fi rm on having a domestic focus,
vision and orientation while he keeps looking for opportunities.
<p>2. In the second kind of fi rm, the marketing manager ensures that the fi rm serves the international
market and develops international strategies to compete with other international fi rms.
<p>Let us discuss the economic, social and cultural environment of countries where fi rms want to do
business and see how they have an impact on business.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management38
<p>The task of the international marketing manager is to recognise both the similarities and the dif-
ferences that characterise the economic, social and cultural ethos of the countries of the world and
incorporate them in the international marketing planning process.
<p>A fi rm looking at international marketing opportunities must have a focus on its country&rsquo;s
orientation. How is the country better than other countries? The fi rm may have an egocentric view&mdash;it
might focus on areas where it is better than other fi rms in the world. It can also have a polycentric
view of its country&mdash;it might focus on the areas where its country is better than other countries of the
world. The best is, of course, to have a geocentric view, with a dual focus regarding the fi rm&rsquo;s and
the country&rsquo;s superiority.
<p>Expanding the theme further, we see the following paradigm:
<p>1. Ethnocentric focus on the home country: similarities with foreign countries/dissimilarities with
foreign countries to showcase the similarities and differences as a competitive advantage.
<p>2. Polycentric focus: home country is unique, locates the differences with foreign countries
and either modifi es the product as per requirements or use the difference as a competitive
advantage.
<p>3. Region-centric focus:locates similarity in a world region and plans sales accordingly.
4. Geocentric focus: locates similarities and differences in home and host countries.
<p>Let us analyse the strengths of some of the countries:
<p>1. USA: It buys superior products that might have high prices and involve top quality
technology.
<p>2. Latin America: Countries of this region buy only from the people with whom they have strong
relationships and a good rapport. Quality is usually a secondary consideration. Contacts are
built by the behaviour of the fi rm&rsquo;s people, gestures, words and postures.
<p>In some countries, price and benefi ts of the product assume great importance. In fact, a fi rm needs
to know who the customers are in a country, what they want and what is important to them.
<p>The economic environment of a country is a major determinant of market potential and opportunity.
It is possible to identify distinct stages and formulate estimates about the type of demand that will be
found in a country or market at a particular stage of economic development.
<p>Differences arise when you compare the under-developed, the developing and the developed
countries. There are also differences between an agrarian society and a highly developed one. In each
case, the GDP and per capita income differ a great deal as discussed next:
<p>1. High-income countries with per capita income greater than US$ 12,000: There are 27 such
countries with a combined population of 818 million.
<p>2. Upper middle-income countries with per capita income between US$ 2,000 and US$ 12,000:
There are 35 such countries with a combined population of 912 million.
<p>3. Lower middle-income countries with per capita income between US$ 400 and US$ 2,000: There
are 65 such countries with a combined population of 1.775 billion.
<p>4. Lower-income countries with per capita income less than US$ 400. There are 42 such countries
with a combined population of 1.725 billion.
<p>These fi gures are given only as guidelines and should not be taken as sacrosanct. </p>
<br>
</div>

<p>International Marketing 39
<p>In the eighteenth century, most countries of the world had an agrarian economy. It was the
Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century in Europe that gave the world an industrial economy,
with assembly line mass production techniques and material wealth. Rich countries today have high
productivity per worker, in as much that their labour costs are high too. Poor countries have low
labour costs and lower productivity per worker. The following factors need to be addressed in
selecting markets:
<p>1. Population and income
2. Number of households
3. Climatic conditions
4. Price negotiating culture
5. Languages spoken
<p>India with its large population has a good market potential. The US is a bigger market than Brazil.
China has come up as a big market with its vast population. Russia as an emerging market provides
an opportunity to sell high-tech products.
<p>Cold countries have a huge requirement of heating equipments while warm countries need air
conditioners and coolers.
<p>Price has been an important factor in purchase decisions. The methods of negotiating the price differ
across countries. Small to large gifts (read bribes) is the norm in some countries. Inviting a potential
customer to cocktail parties is prevalent in some countries. However, fi rms must know if it is good
manners to invite ladies to such parties or not. In most countries, it is advisable to hire a local guide
who knows the customs of the country and can translate the language with all its nuances so that no
slip-up takes place. Forcing your own will does not necessarily mean success in business.
<p>The task of the international marketing manager is to identify similarities and differences that
characterise individuals and cultures of the countries of the world, so that strategies, products and
marketing plans are effi ciently adapted to global markets.
<p>The expansion plans of fi rms should start by comparing, contrasting and analysing the economic
environment of different countries. Marketeers should recognise that the economic environment is, but
one of the several infl uential factors for analysing the global market. The socio-cultural environment
needs to be considered as well.
<p>PRODUCT
<p>Companies should plan strategies for new product development as well as for differentiating
products for international markets. Product policy should take into account the entire life cycle of
the product. Fashion products and certain high-tech electronic products have a very short life cycle.
In the international market, companies need to identify the target market segment (using market
research). Based on the target segment, the product can be positioned from where the customer can
adopt it and then the company can standardise on the product for the segment till they are ready with
the next level of the differentiated product.
<p>The fi rst method used in the international market is to sell the same product as is sold in the local
market. Managers have to fi nd customers for the product. Mercedes is one example where the product </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management40
<p>sold the world over is the same. However, depending on the country, these cars might have left-hand
drive or right-hand drive.
<p>Most products in Japan have to take in to account the fact that the Japanese are on average shorter
than other people. The following matrix shows how it works:
<p>Table 1.2 Product Acceptance Plan
<p>Promotion Do not change product Adapt product Develop new product
Do not change Same product as local Product adaptation New product invention
promotion market product
Change promotion Modify communication/ Dual adaptation New product invention
advertisements
<p>Super markets have been opened in India with some variations. Going to even less developed
countries like some of the African countries, some more innovation may be required. In some countries,
nudity could be permitted in advertising but in most it will not be allowed. Some countries prefer some
specifi c colours. For example, Muslim countries prefer the colour green and fi rms need to keep this
in mind. Advertising needs to keep in mind the local colour preferences, provide the advertisement
a local touch, use local models and make use of appropriate local festivals to push the products.
<p>It cannot be assumed that a product that has done well in the home market will also do well in
the international market. According to Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, products are meant to satisfy
human needs like those of safety, social acceptance, esteem and self-actualisation and psychological
needs. A car is not just a car. Besides being a means of transportation, it is also a refl ection of a person&rsquo;s
lifestyle.
<p>Local products are meant just for one country. There may be a big demand for them in the home
country. The American telecom giant, AT&amp;T, confi ned its business to the US market till the last
quarter of the twentieth century, as the market was large enough for its products. Sometimes product
specifi cations differ. For example, the voltage requirements for electrical goods may differ across
countries. The following are the reasons for going overseas:
<p>1. Firms can utilise their local expertise in the global context and thus improve on it.
2. Firms can use their experience of one market to further their efforts in other markets.
3. They can make better use of managerial expertise.
<p>Customers all over the world love popular international brands. Brands do the following for
products:
<p>1. Brands build trust among the customers who accept the product as reliable that would give
them the known benefi ts.
<p>2. Brands focus the buyers mind on the desired satisfaction from the product.
3. Brands provide the seller&rsquo;s promise and guarantee associated with the product.
4. Brands start occupying the hearts and minds of their satisfi ed customers. Harley Davidson, the
<p>famous bike company would be an example.
5. Brands form economic assets for the company and provide it goodwill.
6. Brands build buyer&ndash;seller relationships. As customers get the desired levels of satisfaction,
<p>they become the brands personal advertisers. Sellers can use these satisfied buyers for </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 41
<p>getting information on new product demands, product variants and the needed product
differentiations.
<p>7. Brands promote customer relationships with the sellers as together they can create stories of the
brand&rsquo;s success for convincing other customers, either by word-of-mouth publicity or through
advertising.
<p>A brand is not just a product on a shelf but is distinguished from similar products or services.
Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Ivory soap are all world known brands. Thus:
<p> Brand = Product + Packaging + Added values
<p>The added values may be:
<p>1. Quality
2. Image
3. Price
4. Function
<p>International products have the potential of being sold in a number of markets. Industrial products
are less dependent on the environment and can be exported with greater ease than consumer products.
For consumer products, product modifi cations may be needed and these modifi cations need to be cost
effective. For example, large milk bottles were not successful in Japan where in small homes people
have small refrigerators, which could not accommodate the large bottles.
<p>Global products are made with the global market in mind. The Mercedes car is the same everywhere.
Sony&rsquo;s Walkman is another example. The high cost of product development needs to be amortised
by a large volume that the global market can provide.
<p>Global brands stick with a common market positioning. Mercedes is in the top bracket of cars
everywhere. Heineken beer is positioned worldwide as a premium beverage. While global products
are marketed the same way around the world, some of the 4Ps like promotion or placement may need
changes. Advertising campaigns must be translated in the local language and at times, this is diffi cult
as the subtle nuances of any language are not easily translatable. The global product/brand must
be guided by the same strategic plans and principles. Coke and Pepsi are two examples of global
brands. Even then, their tastes differ across regions. For example, sweeter colas are preferred in the
east while this is not so in the west.
<p>The following are the pricing considerations for export markets:
<p>1. Price&ndash;quality parity.
2. Price competitiveness.
3. Penetrating or skimming pricing or any other consideration.
4. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume discounts that need to be offered in any overseas
<p>market.
5. Whether segment price differential is required or not.
6. Price elasticity of demand in the overseas market.
7. Overseas governments&rsquo; pricing regulations if any.
8. Any anti-dumping laws.
9. International transportation costs.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management42
<p>10. International currency fl uctuations.
11. Government tax laws.
<p>International pricing strategy takes costs and competitive pricing into account. In case the demand
of the product is not price elastic, it may be worthwhile to keep high prices. The total of fi xed and vari-
able costs tend to go up with the addition of the product adoption costs. Marketing costs could well be
much higher as compared to domestic marketing costs. It is best to select a price with highest margins
after taking the expenses on channel members and marketing into account.
<p>Introductory pricing is done on cost-plus basis or by taking only variable cost into consideration
with only an element of fi xed cost. However, if the market is in the growth stage of the product life
cycle (PLC), a higher price can be fi xed.
<p>PRICE
<p>Companies have to understand the price and other factors that determine the sales of a product. Ex-
port pricing needs careful study of the international market, the selected segment for the product,
transportation costs and tariffs of the host country.
<p>Firms have to be careful in pricing the product in different countries. Import levies, currency rate
fl uctuations, grey markets and price escalations are areas that need careful consideration by the fi rm.
Some of the methods used for fi xing the price are:
<p>1. Same price across the world: This is not really practical if the fi rm is marketing in both rich and
poor countries.
<p>2. Prevailing market price: A fi rm can adopt the price at which the local vendors are selling the
product.
<p>3. Modifi ed prevailing price: If the export fi rm can charge a higher price due to its better brand
equity, it should sell at a higher price as price gets equated with the product quality. Hence, if a
fi rm charges a low price or the same price as the local vendors although its product is superior,
the customers will put it in the same league as the local product.
<p>4. Cost plus pricing: This method is adopted when the product is far superior and there is no
competition worth the name. As there is no basis of competitive pricing, the fi rm can charge a
higher price on the basis of its cost to make and sell by adding extra amount by way of price
of quality and brand equity.
<p>In case a country is going through an infl ationary phase, price increases can be resorted to at
regular intervals.
<p>DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS
<p>When the product is manufactured in one country and sold in another country, the fi rm selling it has
to consider internationalisation of distribution channels. The fi rm may have its marketing centre for
both local and export sales in its own country. Later, it may start its export marketing offi ce either </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 43
<p>in the country to which the goods are being exported or in some third centrally located country.
The distance and freight need to be taken into account. The marketing set-up would take shape as
discussed in Figure 1.5.
<p>Figure 1.5 International Marketing Channel
<p>For fi nding the best channel within the host country it is best to have a market survey done because
it could be quite different for different products. Exceptions can be made if the fi rm has a world
monopoly of the product. In the 1970s, one fi rm in the area of electronic components had a complete
monopoly and customers came to India to buy the product, at the fi rm&rsquo;s dictated prices, which were
higher than the domestic market prices, and distributed these products in their own countries.
<p>Normally, the fi rst step taken by fi rms is starting exports to designated countries. For this pur-
pose they need to have an export sales department with one export/international marketing manager.
As the business increases, the fi rm starts offi ces in host countries as well. Experts who arrange for
market surveys, appointment of distribution channel members, market information systems, man
these offi ces.
<p>ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION
<p>For international marketing, companies have to decide to have one of the following plans for advertising
and promotion:
<p>1. Global strategy: Here the same advertising and promotion works for the entire world market.
The Pepsi circle of blue and red is recognised all over the world.
<p>2. Multi-domestic strategy: Here the fi rm allows each country&rsquo;s local management to plan their
own advertising and promotion best suited to local conditions. This is the strategy followed
by Lever Brothers.
<p>3. Hybrid strategy: Here the fi rm has a global perspective and yet alters the advertising and
promotion to a limited degree. Most fi rms change the models in their advertisements. For
example, the Japanese would appreciate advertisements with Japanese models.
<p>MARKET GLOBALISATION
<p>The process of market globalisation has speeded up in this century. The most globalised nation is
Ireland. After it, comes Singapore, Switzerland, Holland and Finland. India has been ranked at 61
in the list of globalised countries. The countries have been assessed on their international trade, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management44
<p>FDIs and the income accruing thereof. Besides, the infrastructure facilities form the assessment base
and include telephones, travel and movement of personnel. Technological standards and political
stability are the other factors taken into consideration.
<p>India ranks highest in its interweaving with the international organisations of the UN at the 28th
position. It ranks 30th for remittances and personal transfers. In other areas like economy, personnel,
technology, political factors, trade, travel, internet, host treaties and investment income, it ranks
between 50 and 60. These numbers only prove the point that as a developing nation India has a long
way to go in terms of globalisation. Table 1.3 gives India&rsquo;s ranking in various areas.

<p>There has been production globalisation that takes into account the principles of opting for the
lowest cost manufacturing country keeping the quality standards at par with the home country
standards. Similarly, markets have become globalised with the advent of increased travel by people
around the world. This has led to product knowledge and availability to travellers.
<p>Firms usually start marketing their products in their own country, that is, they fi rst sell their
product in the domestic market. Once established as a known brand and accepted supplier of goods,
they need to diversify their markets and the fi rst step in that direction is exports to another country.
Excess production, which cannot fi nd market in the country of origin, is the starting point of exports.
Later on, fi rms do take up special production of goods for exports. Some others build an export bank
(inventory) to avoid any clash with the demands of the domestic market. Firms have to realise that
the product, which is considered as giving value for money and fulfi lling the customer&rsquo;s needs must
do the same in the overseas market.
<p>Once the fi rm wants to get established in the export market, it has to understand the business
environment of the foreign country. The four Ps of the host country&mdash;product, price, placement and
promotion may not have the same relevance elsewhere.</p>

<p>In prehistoric times, the city-states traded through the barter system. One state had one product
while the other had some other product and they both needed the products that the other had. The
same type of advantage in tradable products between countries works even today, except that
the scene is much more complex with several countries in competition and myriads of products
having global access.
<p>In India, exports are a fi rm&rsquo;s imperatives due to following reasons:
<p>1. The partial convertibility of Rupee, which gives the foreign exchange needed to exporters for
their imports for production.
<p>2. Need to achieve economies of scale of production for lowering costs and making prices
competitive for exports too.
<p>3. With MNCs getting a foothold in India, fi rms need to have greater markets, which India cannot
provide.
<p>4. The intangible benefi ts are the improvement of product quality, improvements in communi-
cation systems.
<p>5. Upgradation of technology.
6. Cost reduction due to large-scale manufacture.
7. Utilisation of human resources like in the IT sector, where India has a large workforce.
8. Internationalisation of Indian brands.
<p>Let us discuss the negative factors of going for exports:
<p>1. Low image of the country as a supplier of quality goods. This is gradually changing.
2. Firm&rsquo;s culture, which does not give the required fi llip to exports.
3. Lack of experience in international business and the fear of the unknown.
4. Cultural differences between nations.
5. Entry barriers in some countries, governmental controls and in some cases, like the US, the
<p>existence of quota systems for exports.
<p>There are some common factors as discussed next:
<p>1. Balance of payment between trading nations.
2. Stability of their currency.
3. Transportation costs.
4. Infrastructure status.
5. Quality control plans in each country and how these manifest in international trade.
6. Trading blocks like the EU, NAFTA and ASEAN.
7. The WTO, which regulates international trade and settles trade disputes between nations.
8. Political instability in some regions.
9. Economic upheavals of the Far East, Japan.
<p>CULTURAL ASPECTS OF GLOBAL BUSINESS
<p>It is widely believed that culture is not inherent but is learnt. Different areas of culture are interrelated;
a particular area&rsquo;s population shares a common culture and it differentiates the area from other areas. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management46
<p>Culture guides people to respond to situations and since it has been learnt, it is diffi cult to change.
Marketeers need to fi nd some common reference point between cultures of different countries,
because it is the culture of a country that defi nes behaviour norms and reactions of its people
<p>Some countries have the government red tape as their work ethos or work culture. Companies need
to understand the ways of circumventing issues that can get delayed due to red tape. In some countries,
the people in power do not work without some sort of payback, like bribes in the form of cash or gifts.
<p>For example, in France there is elaborate coordination between business and industry and the
country&rsquo;s government. The government makes sure that the most effective use is made of the country&rsquo;s
resources&mdash;human, fi nancial, technological and information. The government wants to ensure that
there is no resource deployment in uneconomic areas. The companies revise their plans every fi ve
years to focus on economic growth, price stability and repatriation of foreign payments. They want
to keep the employment situation favourable. France has planned global strategies for specifi c areas
like electronics, microelectronics, consumer and automation industries.
<p>The country tries to have perfect coordination between the government, industry and the uni-
versities. The major drawback in France for outsiders is their lack of quantifi able and rational data.
France fully supports the European community. The planning process is organised along govern-
mental guidelines.
<p>Germany, on the other hand, believes in having its labour force under the management of companies.
The boss-ordering-about syndrome still exists there as the boss has all the authority. To outsiders, the
labour management partnership therefore, may appear more to be a corporate gimmick aimed at
keeping the unions satisfi ed. Germany has a benevolent and yet authoritarian leadership. There are
worker directors in most companies who participate in major staffi ng decisions. The laws require
companies to have workers on their board of directors.
<p>While Japan has forged ahead to become a major economic force, Korea is trying desperately to
catch up with Japanese business. Japan believes in lifetime employment for its workers. The decision-
making process seems a bit complicated to outsiders as they take collective decisions. With the free
fl ow of information, collective decision-making appears to be a sound policy, while the responsi-
bility of the decision outcomes rests with one person only.
<p>The Japanese believe that good education is essential for success. They have a consultative form
of decision-making with upward fl ow of decisions. Authority usually comes with seniority and there
is respect for age. Loyalty to the company a person joins is lifelong; however, this characteristic is
getting eroded in the present times. In the US, business decision orientation is on a short-term basis.
Decisions are taken on an individual basis. Brainstorming sessions help the decision-makers in getting
views contrary to their own, as there are people who play the devil&rsquo;s advocate in each meeting. The
decision-making process is top driven and as it is individualistic, it is quite fast. However, the imple-
mentation of decisions can be slow.
<p>Australia is politically stable, its business runs on social value systems. Australian entrepreneurs
are ready to take risks for developing their businesses.
<p>China believes in having both fi ve-year and one-year plans that are formulated by the top committee
members. The fl ow of critical decisions is from top to bottom. The decision-making process is slow
and so is the implementation process.
<p>Companies use some of the following techniques to gauge whether their company will be successful
in a particular country or not:
<p>1. Discounted cash fl ow
2. Payback period</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 47
<p>3. Net present value
4. Return on sales
5. Return on assets
6. Internal rate of return
7. Return on equity
<p>There are certain basic risks connected to international marketing as discussed next:
<p>1. Risk of unknown competition.
2. Risk of change of currency rates.
3. Political risks of having new governments with different agendas for foreign companies.
<p>The home country objectives of business are dependent on its cultural ethos and transposing
them on to another country would need defi ning the cultural ethos of that country. If the marketeers
try to impose their country&rsquo;s culture on the other country, it may complicate the issue and hence it
is imperative to leave out one&rsquo;s own country&rsquo;s cultural biases while formulating the objectives of
business for other countries. There may be, however, products that have universal appeal and they
would not need any such action.
<p>PRODUCT INNOVATION
<p>While a product may be introduced as an innovative one in one country, it may already be in a stage
of maturity in some other country. Product acceptance in new countries takes the following steps:
<p>1. Product knowledge or awareness, which comes from advertising.
2. Interest in the product makes prospective customers obtain more information about the
<p>product.
3. Judgement about the value of the product is made at this stage.
4. The next step is the trial stage when the customer tries out the product before adopting it.
<p>The rate of adoption of a product depends on the following considerations:
<p>1. Competitive advantage of the product and also the competitive advantage of its country of
origin like low-cost labour, balance of payment situation and currency rates.
<p>2. Acceptance of change. Some countries like the US need to change their products all the time,
while countries like Japan and India prefer to stay with the old products unless something of
great interest comes along.
<p>3. Ease of usage of the product and its compatibility with other products in use.
4. Ease of trial helps in ensuring product usage.
5. Availability of information when needed is vital for the customer trying to make a change.
<p>Major cultural differences can be seen in US and Japan. While the US has an individualistic man-
agement style, the Japanese style of management is based on group decisions. </p>

Foreign exchange is the currency sold or bought in the foreign exchange market. The transaction
<p>takes place as shown in Figure 1.6.
<p>Figure 1.6 Foreign Currency Dealings
<p>The major task of local banks in international business is handling money. The most common form
of money transaction is the letter of credit (LC). These can be of the following types:
<p>1. Revocable LC with recourse
2. Revocable LC without recourse
3. Irrevocable LC with recourse

<p>GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS
<p>Advertising in the international market must take the country&rsquo;s cultural ethos into account. For ex-
ample, in Islamic countries, green is the preferred colour. In China, yellow is the sacred colour and
should be used only for holy products. White is the colour of purity in the west while in south Asia
it is the colour of mourning.
<p>In UK, all advertising is allowed unless not forbidden; in Germany, all advertising is forbidden
unless allowed. In Italy, everything is allowed even if it is forbidden and in Belgium, no one knows
what is not allowed.
<p>Advertising takes three forms in the international market as discussed next:
<p>1. Global
2. Multi-domestic
3. Hybrid
<p>In global advertising, one campaign is planned and used globally whereever the fi rm is selling
the product. The Mercedes car is a typical example as the same car sells without any modifi cation
and the same advertising goes with it. In contrast, in multi-domestic selling, each country plans its
own campaign according to its culture. Lever Brothers give total freedom to the local management
regarding the campaign.
<p>In the hybrid plan, while the global idea remains the same each country can change it to suit its
market. Models can be of local ethnicity and metaphors used are those that are understood by the
local population.
<p>The percentage of GNP spent by countries on advertising are given in Table 1.5.
Russia has become a nation of the rich and the poor. The rich Russians are looking for new products.
<p>They see a lot of TV and are happy even with second-hand goods. The best way to advertise in Russia
is as follows:
<p>1. Provide exact information.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management50
<p>2. Give usage details.
3. Introduce new kinds of products.
4. Concept selling.
5. Introduce lifestyle products.
<p>In China, outdoor advertising is used. For product demonstrations, the Chinese like to see TV
advertisements. Testimonials by experts are favoured too.
<p>While selecting an advertising agency, the following issues need to be considered:
<p>1. Is it an Indian agency with foreign collaboration or a foreign agency with offi ces in India?
2. Some countries adopt a nationalistic approach as is the case in Canada and here it is a good
<p>idea to appoint a local agency. Local agencies provide the subtle nuances of the local culture
and language as also the goodwill of the target market.
<p>MARKETING CHANNELS
<p>In order to decide the most effective channel, the fi rm must consider the market segment it wants to
cater to and the product positioning in the market. Channel selection should refl ect the fi rm&rsquo;s strengths
and competitive advantages. In the beginning, it is correct to use similar channels as already in use
by the competition. Distributors should be selected on the basis of their experience with similar prod-
ucts, commitment to the fi rm&rsquo;s objectives and fi nancial and human resources for the task. Trainability
of their staff in selling the product is useful. If they can provide after-sales service it is an added
advantage. The distributors normally appoint retailers, but initially it is a good idea to approve their
appointment to ensure a long-term profi table association with them. For industrial products, fi rm
should look for technically-oriented distributors. They will then be able to supplement the fi rm&rsquo;s
salespersons&rsquo; efforts in a positive way.
<p>Figure 1.8 shows the relative importance of advertising and personal selling, either by a fi rm&rsquo;s
salesperson or by its distributors.
<p>In most developing countries, the age-old distribution systems are valid as discussed here:
<p>1. Sole distributors
2. Area distributors
3. Dealers

<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING&mdash;WTO
<p>In order to ensure free trade between member nations, the UN members formed a body that is supposed
to monitor, regulate and assist in trade between nations. The fi rst such body was the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). It was basically meant for trade in merchandised goods. Eventually, it
evolved into an improved world body&mdash;the WTO. The WTO covers goods, services like international
telephones, creative works and intellectual property rights. It is a formal structured organisation with
its rules binding on all its members. It is also a body for settling trade disputes between nations. It
has an arbitration mechanism and an appellate body where nations aggrieved from the decisions of
arbitration can appeal against the same.
<p>While the GATT had 128 members, the WTO has nearly 140 members with more wanting to join.
The WTO has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. It performs the following tasks:
<p>1. Administer and police the existing and new free trade zones in the world.
2. Oversee world trade practices.
3. Settle trade disputes.
<p>Figure 1.8 Relative Importance of Advertising and Personal Selling</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management52
<p>It was in 1995 that the WTO came into existence. There were seven years of long fruitless nego-
tiations, known as the Uruguay Round of trade talks when the new apex body, the WTO, was formed.
It came into existence on 1 January 1995. It has the authority to make rules and regulations governing
international trade and to enforce the same among the member nations. There are several problems
that this body has faced:
<p>1. Farmers in the EU received huge subsidies that gave them an extra edge over others in agriculture
products in international trade.
<p>2. The Multi-fi bre Agreement for trade in textiles was another example of managed trade.
3. The removal of these and similar biases are planned by the WTO. It may, however, take some
<p>time before quota in the textile trade is fully removed making it part of free trade.
<p>For the developing nations, however, the WTO has some negative aspects as trade, fi nance and
development go hand in hand and the developing nations need extra support for their growth. In
fact, it can be seen that the developing nations are also large markets for the developed nations and
therefore their development is in the interest of the developed nations too. It is imperative that a
level-playing fi eld is created between the two, the developing and the developed nations, with special
emphasis for the weaker nations.
<p>AREAS THE WTO NEEDS TO LOOK INTO
<p>Managed Trade
<p>While free trade remains the objective, yet most nations have non-tariff bases trade barriers. These
include critical and almost impossible product specifi cations, testing methods and source verifi cation
of components and raw materials. Outsourcing from international manufacturers the essence of
international trade is getting warped.
<p>Free Trade
<p>While trade may be free, does it also give a fair share of trade profi ts to the trading partners? Profi ts,
employment, foreign exchange earnings, technology upgrades, production capacities, infrastructure
development and building of institutions keeps the parity between rich and developing nations a
dream only.
<p>Market Entry
<p>Even within the WTO regime, powerful nations have the facility to safeguard their interests while the
weaker nations have no option but to follow the WTO rules. The best way for these nations is to accept </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 53
<p>the existence of the WTO and then work to get the best possible advantage of its rules. Each market has
some internal forces like the political set-up, level of liberalisation of economy and its infrastructure.
Developed nations have built such diffi cult paths for the entry of products from developing nations,
product specifi cations being one of them.
<p>Hence, countries like India need to take following steps to make themselves ready for the global
market:
<p>1. Have clear goals and strategies.
2. Strong points as strategic options and correct assessment of bargaining power during negotiating
<p>rounds of the WTO meetings.
3. Dynamic coordination between nations with similar ideas/problems.
<p>Work on these has been going on and it needs to be intensifi ed with a sense of urgency. The WTO,
it must be understood is here to stay and it would be prudent to get the best out of it. It is for every
ones benefi t in international trade. Nations should help improve competitiveness of their trade by
helping domestic fi rms in getting better technology, better infrastructure support and management.
There could be assistance to domestic trade to enable it to compete with world players on a level
playing fi eld.
<p>India as a member of the WTO has to accept and honour its rules. India should therefore have an
integrated plan for complying with WTO rules. It could be done in the following way:
<p>1. Help fi rms get better technology, management and organise state of the art infrastructure
support to make them competitive in the country and globally. Technology should meet with
the best in the range available anywhere in the world.
<p>2. Remove internal hurdles for fi rms to prepare them for international competition.
3. Phase introduction of globalisation and liberalisation to give breathing time to fi rms to adjust
<p>to international competition.
4. Help in strengthening the anti-dumping institution and competition by identifying the areas of
<p>dumping and the damage it is causing to the affected countries. Then, the reasons for dumping
including industry capacity and fi nancial muscle should be understood.
<p>5. The WTO accepts the link between law and economics. Legal battles fought in foreign countries
are expensive. Experts and consultants in the area of the WTO should be brought in and they
should be able to coordinate with their international counterparts.
<p>The International Marketing Game 1.1
<p>Starting the Game
<p>Students on their own or with the help of the faculty form teams for playing the game for which
instructions are given at the end of each chapter. The tasks may not directly relate to the preceding
chapter but they are connected with the subject being learnt.
<p>(continued)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management54
<p>The students are expected to create an ideal structure using group dynamics, for which time will
be allowed to conduct research that is practical. They will need to express their understanding of the
international marketing environment and related business issues. Students will need to pick topics
quickly and work in groups of 4&ndash;6 students each. Some time should be spent on library research
and some in primary research. Students will need to organise and manage their time effi ciently.
Part of being a manager is to have self-management and time-management skills. Students will
need to keep a good routine and not waste time.
<p>Students will have the freedom to organise amongst themselves. One person will be assigned
the group leader and will be responsible to see that everyone reports to him/her. The group will
need to meet and divide tasks amongst the team members. They will need to make sure that there
is enough time for writing and editing the report. This usually takes more time than expected. The
project should be relevant to today&rsquo;s international marketing scenario. Some suggestions are:
<p>1. Pick up an FMCG product and a country of the Middle East. Plan a proper marketing research
to evaluate its market demand and to assess the buyer&rsquo;s behaviour in the country.
<p>2. Select a consumer durable and locate a market near India and plan a research methodology
to obtain the demand in that country.
<p>Company Studies
<p>These topics involve fi eld interviews and correspondence combined with documentary sources.
Students have to make full use of the libraries of the institute as well as others like the US Library
or the British Council library.
<p>1. A global marketing audit: Design a marketing audit that a company can use to determine
where it is in the Keegan typology of stages of development of a global corporation and what
it should do with the information. Chapter 21 (&lsquo;International Marketing Audit&rsquo;) deals with
the subject in detail and students should read it before starting the audit.
<p>2. Reports analysing the global marketing strategies of companies.
3. Global product management: Under what circumstances have companies integrated their
<p>domestic and foreign product planning and management? What factors have led to this
integration? What are the explicit and hidden costs and benefi ts?
<p>4. Global marketing transfers: How do companies manage the transfer of marketing experience
internationally?
<p>5. International marketing data analysis: Analysis of published data with implications for
management.
<p>6. Global market performance analysis: Economic and social data combined with a company&rsquo;s
sales, earnings and expenditure data and judgemental measures of competition could be
used to measure and evaluate market performance in different countries.
<p>Topic Reports
<p>1. Marketing in countries like Japan, India, the US, Europe, and China by using secondary
sources and personal interviews. If you make this type of report, make sure that your report
has practical recommendations for marketing managers.
<p>(continued)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing 55
<p>2. Export pricing policies. Examine the export pricing method used by a company or group of
companies and make recommendations for improvements. Explain why you recommended
these changes.
<p>3. Pricing strategy in an MNCs for infl ationary markets.
4. How can Indian programmers solve software problems in the US while the Americans
<p>are sleeping (the question of time lag). A proposal to an American software company (for
example, Microsoft) to engage software professionals in Bangalore to fi nd time-sensitive
solutions at a competitive rate, making use of the difference in time zones and pay scales.
<p>5. Using the internet to scan and search for international business opportunities. This can be a
company study or a report. Ideally, students can do their research on the internet and interview
representatives of companies that have used the internet to expand internationally.
<p>6. Creating equidistance in viewing the customer: Suggest a strategy where international
competitors can be close to the customer whether the customer is located 5 km away or
10,000 km away.
<p>7. An original research project that fulfi ls the requirement of international marketing and
involves both primary and secondary research and is doable in two weeks.
<p>As soon as the project is agreed by the group, a proposal should be written and an approval
must be taken from the faculty who will question the students and make sure that the project can
be carried out.
<p>QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
<p>1. Defi ne the data needed by an FMCG fi rm for taking marketing decisions. Also, discuss how the
fi rm should go about collecting the data and using it?
<p>2. Defi ne the following:
<p>(a) Merchandise export and import
(b) Service export and import
(c) Licensing agreements
(d) Franchising
(e) FDI
(f) Joint ventures
(g) Portfolio investments
(h) MNCs

<p>2 Market Potential of Countries
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
The chapter is aimed at creating a thirst for knowledge and systematic methods of acquiring the same
about the different countries where the company plans to do business. The students of international
marketing need to have in-depth knowledge and expertise in the business environment of the host
countries, present and likely future competition. It will help the students in planning marketing strategies
for those countries.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 57
<p>Before planning international marketing, it is essential to understand opportunities and threats
that await a company in the overseas markets. Companies usually start international operations
by taking a slow and cautious approach, understandably because of lack of market knowledge.
<p>However, this approach could lead the company to lose out on opportunities that are available in the
overseas markets. Later on, when the company is ready to give its full thrust to international market-
ing, the potential business may have died out or gone to competition. Companies need to analyse
their core competencies. Besides, they should learn in detail the sustainable competitive advantage
that the company enjoys in its home country&rsquo;s market. Next, the company has to know the overseas
market it wants to enter and then dovetail the company&rsquo;s strengths with that country&rsquo;s requirements.
In this way, the company can utilise its business acumen to the best possible advantage. Which country
provides the most appropriate justifi cation for entering its market that would add on to the company&rsquo;s
core competencies besides generating the desired revenues? Can the company gain economies of
scale of manufacturing, can it diversify its product range or can it innovate its products for better
acceptance even in the local market? Maruti&rsquo;s unique selling proposition (USP) is its countrywide
service network. Would they like to carry on with the same USP in the international market and would
it benefi t them there? These questions need to be answered before companies take the plunge in the
international market.
<p>A company should fi nd out the country that provides the best ground reality in the following
areas:
<p>1. The economic conditions should be such that the company prospers by doing business there.
2. The cultural diversity should not be so acute as to provide a barrier to business.
3. The government regulations should encourage companies from India.
4. The geographic situation should assist in intercountry trade.
<p>These provide a defi nitive indicator regarding the correctness of a country being selected for
international marketing.
<p>A company wanting to go overseas for marketing needs to adopt the following course of action:
<p>1. Selection of the right country.
2. Selection of international organisational set-up.
3. Placement of organisational control mechanism.
4. For operations involving several countries, a coordination system should be in place in order
<p>to get optimum benefi ts from overseas marketing.
<p>Next, the company must decide its objectives for international marketing, its operational planning
and strategies for achieving the objectives. The company should study the host country&rsquo;s business
environment, both the general factors and the competitive factors. The company has to decide about
the country where it has to export as well as the country from where the product should emanate,
the production base, as the company can outsource manufacturing to a third country if it is found to
be economical to do so.
<p>Companies look for long term sustainable competitive advantage and for this purpose they need to
have a differentiated or innovative product and it should be manufactured in a place or country that
provides for low-cost manufacturing. Business can pick up in several countries if such a production
base is available. At times companies plan overseas sales because they have excess manufacturing
capacity in the home country. Companies set up manufacturing facilities in the hope that the market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management58
<p>will grow. However, in case it does not come up to the expected levels, companies facing problems of
excess production would do well to export the excess production, if possible. When a company sees
a good overseas marketing opportunity with no manufacturing base, it may just leave the market.
Proximity to the production base does give a company an advantage.
<p>International marketing decisions are based on the following variables that need to be studied
carefully by companies:
<p>1. Local demand.
2. International demand country-wise.
3. Location of the manufacturing bases.
4. Competitive manufacturing bases.
5. Distance between the manufacturing base and the markets, both for the company and its
<p>competitors.
6. The existing economies of scale or its possibilities.
<p>If a company misses out on any of these factors it may lose out on business opportunities overseas.
Once the selection has been made, countries should be listed on the basis of the priority the company
wants to give them for starting international marketing. After securing a low-cost manufacturing place,
markets should be selected for international marketing. Political stability, geographic proximity and
cultural synergy are the other parameters that need careful study. However, companies should not
lose out on the time factor as no vacuum of market remains vacant for long. International marketing
needs resource allocation in the countries and therefore the order of entry in different countries must
be decided with speed. The country that provides the greatest market potential should be the fi rst to
be entered. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the country, the per capita income, the balance of
payment between the nation and the company&rsquo;s country are other factors that need consideration.
<p>As per the World Bank, as compared to the American economy, the Indian economy is about 20 per
cent and is ranked at number six, behind the US, Japan, China, Germany, France. By 2020, the Indian
economy is expected to grow to occupy the fourth position, just behind China, the US and Japan.
The present market strength of the US, Japan and Western Europe would give way to India&ndash;China
dominance.
<p>Countries that have geographic proximity, similarities in language, markets and buyer behaviour,
tend to find favour with companies planning international marketing. Countries where the
governments encourage foreign sellers or at least are not averse to their entry in the country are more
acceptable to companies. These countries would allow for the repatriation of profi ts in hard currency
to the home country by the international sellers. Besides, countries that companies want to select for
international marketing should have synergy with international marketeers in terms of product
quantities, technology fi t and cultural acceptance.
<p>Earlier, government-owned fi rms had tremendous leverage in getting business from the gov-
ernment, including a substantial price preference. In other words, a government-owned fi rm would
get an order for supplies from the government even if its prices were substantially higher. This led to
an extensive non-accountability factor as the price could be loaded with factors of ineffi ciency as also
take care of any underhand dealings, which tended to increase the price. It should not be construed
that such ineffi ciencies did not fi gure in privately-owned fi rms. Yet, their numbers were few and the
accountability factor mostly took care of the ineffi cient and corrupt elements in the private sector.
<p>Since now we are truly in the age of market economy in practically the entire world, let us take a
look at what exactly a market economy is.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 59
<p>MARKET ECONOMY OF THE WORLD
<p>Today, in the twenty-fi rst century, most countries are part of the market-driven economy. It is product
quality, price, brand equity and availability of products, which play a major role in market dynamics.
These factors have been given the celebrated name of the 4Ps. Product demand is also dependent
on the market segment&rsquo;s business environment like demographic, social, cultural, political and legal
factors. Competitive factors too play a major role in establishing business shares among the various
players.
<p>Factories churn out products with the help of employees, raw materials and consumables and the
employees are, in a way, buyers of the products. Employees work for wages and use the wages for
making purchases. (The products may be from one factory and buyers from another factory or any
other discipline.)
<p>The market economy brings the customer into focus as he gets competitive products to choose
from, competitive prices and fi rms vie with each other in product positioning and placement and in
communicating with the customers through a multitude of advertising formats. Firms too are free to
opt for certain markets, segments and channels of distribution. Thus, the interplay between buyers and
sellers depends on the supply and demand situation and on the strengths of the fi rms. Their strength
comes from product quality, service to the customer and generation of brand equity.
<p>The market economy can be best understood by comparing it with the closed economies of the
communist world, where the manufacturing process is restricted by the government and so is
the supply. We all have heard of the days of rationing in the Soviet Union. In fact, even in India there
was rationing of essential products till the fi rst half of the last century.
<p>The market economy can come to a country only if the restrictions on production and rules to
regulate supply and purchase (including imports of raw materials) are removed by the government
and the industry is left free to take its own decisions in these matters on the basis of market needs.
A look at the pre-1991 era is suffi cient to understand the stranglehold the Indian government had on
the markets during the period prior to the reforms:
<p>1. For manufacturing any product, fi rms needed a manufacturing license from the government&rsquo;s
ministry of industries.
<p>2. For foreign equity participation and technology transfer very stringent approvals were required
from the ministry of industries and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
<p>3. For the import of raw materials, a lot of approvals were required from the industry ministry
and the RBI.
<p>4. The custom duty on most products was high, it even went up to 300 per cent ad valorem.
5. Interest rates for borrowing was high.
<p>Since 1991, with major changes in the industrial policy, the Government of India has tried to bring
the country&rsquo;s economy under market control. Yet, a few more reforms are needed like the full con-
vertibility of Rupee.
<p>For a free economy, the control of the government on business should be non-existent. The gov-
ernment&rsquo;s task should be to safeguard the interests of all its citizens. They should be free to choose
their vocation, be it buying or selling manufacturing products, buying or selling property and citizens
should be free to pursue it, as they desire, without interference from the government as long as they
do not commit any legal transgressions.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management60
<p>In the communist regime, the entire process of production planning, raw materials procurement
and doling out rationed quantities was centralised with the government. Seeing the growth and devel-
opment of the west, most countries of the erstwhile Soviet group have opted out of central planning
and are now looking at joining the market-driven economy.
<p>MIXED ECONOMIES
<p>In India, the mixed economy was created with joint sector ventures, where the private players and the
government were both partners. While such fi rms tried to get the best of both, that is, easy government
approvals and speedier decision-making process associated with the private sector, in the end, they
lost out on both counts as the government felt that their only responsibility was to control the activity
of the fi rm, and the private partner felt that the government was interfering a lot.
<p>Even in purely private fi rms, there is an element of outside control in the form of directors on their
board from fi nancial institutions and the banks that fi nance them. Besides, there is compulsory statutory
audit by outside auditors. Despite these controls, the last few years have seen a large number of scams
through either the equity market or fake loan companies. It is in this context that the Government of
India is looking for checks and balances and has assigned this task to the Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI).
<p>The world over it can be seen that while in China there is a greater degree of governmental control,
Japan, where market forces determine the market dynamics, has fewer. While some countries like
Hungary and Taiwan are partly under free market with only some governmental interference, coun-
tries like Russia and Mexico are not free to a great extent. Likewise, Cuba cannot be considered com-
pletely free of governmental interference.
<p>Products like power supply and telecommunication have remained in the government set up
in most countries and today in India these products face competition from private fi rms. This has
created an era of competition, much to the benefi t of the consumers and it has resulted in the stream-
lining of government fi rms in order to make them more effi cient. The manufacture and supply of
defence equipment is usually the last of the product groups to come to the private sector, while in
India, paradoxically, the defence services did not think twice while purchasing their products from
foreign private fi rms.
<p>The discussion on how much of governmental interference is good for a country&rsquo;s economic
growth goes on eternally in most countries. Developed countries like Germany, Sweden and France
have low level of government ownership. They are highly taxed in the private sector and the money
thus collected is used for welfare measures. In France, government ownership of the business sector
is very high as compared to the other two. The telecom companies keep shuttling between private
and government ownership in France. The Japanese system is based on government&rsquo;s infl uence on
the private sector fi rms. The Japanese government has been channelling the fl ow of investments
in the direction of its choice by setting targets and giving monetary incentives. The Japanese ministry
of international trade and industry guides fi rms through strategic planning for investment and
production with minimal controls.
<p>The other dimension of economic environment deals with whether the country where the fi rms want
to do business is a developed, developing or underdeveloped country. The UN and its subsidiaries
have several plans for helping poor nations and Indian fi rms must take advantage of the largesse
offered to such nations by helping them to come up in the economic order. It has been proven beyond
doubt that countries that opt for the market economy tend to grow economically faster than those </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 61
<p>that do not. China and India are typical examples of accelerated growth following the decision to
embrace market-based economy.
<p>Politics plays a major role in the life of any country. Countries like the US and Japan believe that
in a democratic, free market set-up, customers are free thinking individuals who know what is best
for them and they decide the fate of fi rms in the marketplace. There are no sops or fi nancial crutches
available to non-performers. It is therefore easy to understand that only genuine fi rms that believe in
their product and are ready to provide customer satisfaction are going to survive.
<p>Countries which have totalitarianism as their political philosophy believe that fi rms should not be
let loose to cheat gullible customers and restraints are provided through governmental controls and
interference in the shape of checkers, inspectors and auditors. Even France during its socialist rule
had taken over several of the country&rsquo;s private fi rms under its hold.
<p>There are, in fact, no truly free economies as even in the US there are economic boundaries like
the import quota system for textile imports from developing nations like India. Even the WTO is
controlled by the Dollar power, which restricts trade from developing countries through uncalled
for restrictions and stringent product specifi cations. The other impediments to free economic trade
are trade pacts and trade zones.
<p>It can be safely concluded that each country has its unique system of private and government owner-
ship and control, depending on their system of governance, their status in the development process
and their political situation. Therefore it becomes imperative for fi rms entering foreign countries to
understand the type of economic conditions that prevail in the overseas markets they plan to enter.
<p>For the benefi t of new entrepreneurs it is necessary to put countries into economic zones. The
competitiveness of countries in the international market depends on the following factors:
<p>1. Production and productivity.
2. Demand and its management.
<p>Production factors are based on the following:
<p>1. Capital resource
2. Human resource
3. Information resource
4. Infrastructure
5. Physical resource
6. Management
<p>Firms have to set up resource systems for these in different countries, which would defi ne the fi rm&rsquo;s
production and its productivity. Demand and its management would include the home country&rsquo;s
demand and its growth and international demand. The best way to ascertain demands is through
market research.
<p>CLASSIFICATION OF COUNTRIES
<p>Countries are classifi ed on the following basis:
<p>1. Gross national product (GNP)
2. Gross domestic product (GDP)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management62
<p>3. Per capita income
4. Quality of life or lifestyle
5. Purchasing power
6. Macroeconomic factors
<p>The GNP is in essence the sum total of a country&rsquo;s economic activities and can be defi ned as
&lsquo;the value of goods and services produced during the year from the country&rsquo; resources&rsquo;. The actual
manufacture could take place in the country or even outside it.
<p>The GNP is the sum of domestic production plus the moneys received by residents from overseas
on account of labour or capital investments by way of dividends reduced by the outfl ow of money
made to non-residents.
<p>The GDP takes into account the entire domestic production irrespective of the fact whether
the production is from domestic resources or foreign. It describes the economic activities within the
borders of the country.
<p>The World Bank has, however, accepted GNP as the true representative of a country&rsquo;s wealth
for working on the Bank&rsquo;s analysis of development plans in the country. Based on 1994 fi gures, the
classifi cation of countries on the basis of per capita income is provided in Table 2.1.
<p>Table 2.1 Classifi cation of Countries on the Basis of Per Capita Income (1994)
<p>Low income US$ 725 or less
Lower-middle income US$ 726&ndash;2,895
Upper-middle income US$ 2,896&ndash;8,956
Middle income US$ 726&ndash;8,956
High income US$ 8,957 or more
<p>The low- and middle-income countries are known as developing countries, while high-income
countries are the developed ones. The classifi cation has since been changed to include countries with
economies in transition (CEIT) like China, Russia and Cuba.
<p>The World Bank has categorised countries on the basis of per capita income and GNP as given
in Table 2.2 (only selected countries have been included in the list. Notice that with the exception of
Australia and New Zealand, the rich countries are located in the northern hemisphere).
<p>While the rich nations comprise only 20 per cent of all the nations, they generate almost 80 per cent
of the world GNP. Countries in low-income category comprise about 30 per cent of all the nations but
bring in only about 5 per cent of the world GNP.
<p>The World Bank believes that while GNP is a good indicator of a country&rsquo;s wealth, it does not tell
about the benefi ts accruing to developmental works. The purchasing power parity tells about the
purchase value of the local currency in the home country, against a one-dollar purchase value in the
US. The purchasing power of the local currency is compared to that of the US dollar.
<p>Lifestyle is measured by taking into account the following:
<p>1. Life expectancy
2. Education levels
3. Healthcare programmes
4. Income and allocable surplus as purchasing power
5. Welfare of women</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 63
<p>As per surveys conducted in 1996, the top fi ve countries, which emerged as winners in these
criteria, were:
<p>1. Canada
2. USA
3. Japan
4. Holland
5. Norway
<p>In the list of 174 countries, India&rsquo;s rank is 135, China&rsquo;s 108 and Russia&rsquo;s 57.
In many countries, while wealth generation is taking place, the rich are becoming richer and the
<p>poor remain as they were. Despite this, most people in the world are satisfi ed with their lot and believe
that they are living in a world that is better than the world in which their parents grew up. However,
they also believe that their children will be living in a world that will be worse than today&rsquo;s world.
India&rsquo;s philosophy of contentment under any circumstances has left many citizens so occupied with
their miserable existence that they know nothing better.
<p>Pakistan, on the other hand, has a lot of petro-dollars coming in via the Gulf, which has given their
middle class a better standard of living than their counterparts in India. However, the war hysteria
in Pakistan does not allow the extra wealth to be of good to the country as they use it for honing the
war machinery.
<p>With the opening up of the country&rsquo;s markets to the world, customers now have a choice of different
brands and the urban markets are replete with durable goods of international standards.
<p>Coming to macroeconomic factors, developing countries like India have their GDP distributed
along the following lines:
<p>1. Agriculture&mdash;30 per cent
2. Industry&mdash;30 per cent
<p>Table 2.2 Country Classifi cation on the Basis of Per Capita Income and GNP
<p>Rich countries per capita
GNP US$ 8,957 or more
<p>Upper middle per capita GNP
between US$ 2,896&ndash;8,956

<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management64
<p>3. Manufacturing&mdash;25 per cent
4. Service&mdash;15 per cent
<p>For a developed country like the UK, the distribution is:
<p>1. Agriculture&mdash;2 per cent
2. Industry&mdash;32 per cent
3. Manufacturing&mdash;22 per cent
4. Service&mdash;66 per cent
<p>Nations from the affl uent group are more service oriented. Most of their requirements are met
with imports as with high-labour costs they can not produce goods economically as compared to
less developed nations. Hence the stress is on the service industry, which caters to the recreationary
needs of the population. This is directly related to the quality of life in these countries.
<p>The communist theory was equal distribution of whatever wealth exists, while the market economy
looks at increasing the wealth and believes in its distribution as per individual efforts in producing
the wealth, which would indirectly make every one richer than what they were.
<p>ECONOMIC GROWTH
<p>The business and economic activities in any country depend on a stable government, low infl ation
rates and high growth rates. India is aiming at 6 to 7 per cent growth each year. Similarly, other
developing nations can plan growth rates and by 2020, 60 per cent of the world GNP could be from
today&rsquo;s developing countries. The rich nations want to invest in high-growth countries like China,
Malaysia and Mexico. Poor nations like India and Pakistan miss the foreign direct investments (FDIs).
India has started getting FDI as a result of the government&rsquo;s new industrial policy. However, more
needs to be done. It is hoped that with a stable government and increase in reforms for inviting
FDIs, there will be a substantial improvement in FDIs. Today, India gets about 10 per cent of the FDI
that China gets.
<p>INFLATION
<p>Infl ation is the measure of a country&rsquo;s cost of living, interest rates and exchange rates and it involves
the political and economic system of the country. It is the consumer price index variation over a period
of time. Infl ation can cause an increase in interest rates to offer real interest on interestable assets, as
also for slowing the economic development rate to fi ght infl ation.
<p>THE POLITICAL AND LEGAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
<p>There are several forms of government prevalent in the world that have impact on the countries
economies. Political will usually defi nes the way countries face their economic situations. It was </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 65
<p>in 1991 when India opened its doors to foreign companies as it joined the market economy of the
world. A country&rsquo;s political system and its political thought provides the boundaries within which
its economy operates. Several countries have opted for the privatisation of their business, trade and
commerce. There are areas of exploitation of the weaker sections of society, minorities, ethnic groups
and women in certain countries. International marketeers must consider the risk that lurks around
countries due to their political situations like large numbers of political parties that always have
daggers drawn towards each other. Besides, corruption in high places, political unrest, terrorism, in-
surgency and religious fundamentalism create tensions that undermine the economic development
of a country. Economies progress gets impeded when there are threats of terror attacks and political
instability. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international bodies provide assistance
in a variety of ways to nations for their economic development. Companies must get to know about
these helps to make full use of them.
<p>Companies have to understand a country&rsquo;s legal system, its laws relating to trade, commerce and
outsourcing. When operating in the international arena, companies need to respect the laws of the
land, including those related to taxation, employment, purchasing and reports to be submitted by
the company to the host government. In most countries, corruption and bribery work. Companies
must clearly defi ne the level up to which the management is willing to abide by the dictates of the
host country without compromising on its principles. Countries do have counterfeit trade using
substandard materials.
<p>Companies will do well to understand the political risks in doing business in the host country.
In the 1960s, China decided to uproot all the oil companies with no notice. Employees were asked to
leave the country within 48 hours.
<p>Companies need to understand the difference between subsidies, tariff, corruption, bribery, grey
markets and black markets. It is also important to know the laws relating to intellectual property
rights, copy rights, patents and trademarks applicable in the host country.
<p>Hawala transactions, that is, the underhand transfer of money through dubious means, bring into
existence a parallel economy in certain countries. There are different modalities for money laundering
in different countries.
<p>Companies need to be aware of the local legal environment and the foreign and international legal
environment. Laws of the host country regarding international companies must be respected if the
company wishes to do business in that country. Foreign laws are applicable to outside companies, ex-
patriates operating in the host country and these too must be respected by the company. International
business laws relate to the dealings between two nation companies and they guard the interest of
both, the seller and the buyer. There are provisions for arbitration in case of international disputes.
For instance, certain countries ban the import of certain products. Counterfeit money, drugs,
pornographic material and espionage equipment are usually not permitted to be imported in most
countries. Bribery or &lsquo;speed money&rsquo;, as it is euphemistically called, constitutes an unwarranted illegal
act and must be eschewed by companies.
<p>The Government of India had for a long time the infamous Foreign Exchange Regulation Act
(FERA). This was used to harass international players. It has since been substituted by the Foreign
Exchange Management Act (FEMA), which helps companies in operating their foreign exchange
account in an optimum manner. It helps genuine importers in making payments against supplies to
foreign suppliers.
<p>Governments of countries run on three basic structures, the legislature, the bureaucracy and the
legal structure. Besides, the political parties play their role in either running the government or sitting
in the opposition as the watchdogs of the country&rsquo;s population. The major difference in governance
comes from the form of governance the country has adopted, that is, whether it is a democracy, a </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management66
<p>dictatorship, a monarchy or a constitutional monarchy. Fascism is again raising its head in some
countries as a philosophy of governance.
<p>Firms planning international marketing have to keep scanning both the domestic and international
environment. In a democratic set-up, politicians who are the elected representatives of the people
play an important role in framing the industrial policy of the country. Suggestions and advice from
businessmen, industrialists, trade bodies and fi nancial institutions help the government to look
for alternative plans. Once fi nalised, these plans are implemented and monitored by the political
powers, the bureaucracy, the legislature and the judiciary. The control mechanism of the govern-
ment gives feedback about the success of the plan and it is then suitably modifi ed if required.
<p>The sociopolitical plans of a country are based on the ideology, the political will, and the aims and
the objectives of its government. Countries with several languages, several religions and a variety of
ethnic groups, have a multifaceted ideology. India is a good example of a nation of diverse beliefs
and yet one having unity in diversity. In India, the political system has been tested several times since
independence, and the struggle is still on with religious fundamentalists of both the major religions
vying for power and political parties trying hard to use their muscle power.
<p>A democratic system ensures the following to its citizens:
<p>1. Freedom of speech, opinion, freedom of the press.
2. Elections of legislatures on the basis of adult franchise.
3. Limited time for elected representatives.
4. Independent judiciary.
5. Non-political bureaucracy and defence forces.
6. Mostly transparent decision-making process.
<p>The success of a democracy lies in fulfi lling these obligations to the citizens of the country in a fair
and free manner. Citizens are guaranteed the following freedoms in a democratic set-up:
<p>1. Freedom of press
2. Equality of all citizens before the law
3. Personal social freedom
4. Freedom from governmental apathy and corruption
<p>India has seen the coalition form of government for the past few years. This may well become the
way of governance in the country. This form of government suffers from being indecisive on most
of the governmental issues and it carries a wrong impression that the country is not yet ready for
foreign investments.
<p>India has adopted the British parliamentary system of government. There is a lower house, the Lok
Sabha (akin to the House of Commons) and an upper house, the Rajya sabha (akin to the House of
Lords). Elections to the Lok Sabha are on the basis of adult franchise, while for the Rajya Sabha they
are based on the votes of the elected representatives of the federal states.
<p>The Manager and the Political System
<p>Business has to cope with governmental interference in its working as also with the instability of
governments, which has become part of many countries&rsquo; fate, more specially India. In a democratic </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Potential of Countries 67
<p>set-up, the government has to ensure that its citizens are free to do what they want, where they want
to do it and how they want to go about doing it. Protection of human rights, people&rsquo;s welfare and
correction of market problems, like entry or exit barriers, communication with the consumers about
their rights are the duties of the government. The political process like bilateral treaties, conventions
and trade zones are the areas that the manager has to deal with. Therefore it is important for
fi rms to understand the governmental laws, rules and regulations that are applicable for doing business
in that country. In each country, a number of governmental agencies are involved with international
trade. In some countries there are facilitating agencies while in others there are policing organ-
isations. For example, in the US, the following agencies look after non-agricultural exports:
<p>1. The state department
2. The department of defence
3. The department of commerce
<p>Firms must plan their strategies for meeting the political challenges the host country throws at
them. For this purpose they must understand the particular issue at hand, that is, they need to know
whether it is an ecological and environmental concern, concern about protection of the local industry
through high import duties or the laws regarding the hiring of the workforce. Firms should assess the
actions of competitors on these issues, the success rate and the politically strong lobby, which is ready
to take up their just cause with the government. Next, fi rms should plan their strategy, while keeping
contingent plans ready, in case the fi rst strategy misfi res due to any reason. Proper care needs to be
taken while implementing the strategy with the planning process criteria kept in mind.
<p>The Legal Environment
<p>Most countries follow a legal system that has either evolved there over time or has been adopted from
some theocratic decree. England is considered to be the oldest democracy and it has an unwritten
constitution, which works on precedents, traditions, customs and their usage. The law there is the com-
mon civil law. In most countries, similar civil laws have become prevalent. These laws are interpreted
and enforced by the countries&rsquo; judiciary. The common civil law has become the codifi ed legal system;
the codes form the basis of doing business in more than 70 countries of the world.
<p>The other legal system is the theocratic system, which is followed by the Islamic countries of the
world. It is based on the Koran, the sayings of Prophet Muhammad, writings of Islamic scholars
and the legal communities of these countries. In the Islamic system, charging interest on loans is an
offence. Business with these countries if it involves leasing or credit with payable interest should be
eschewed as it may be a punishable act under their law.
<p>The law in general is categorised as civil and criminal law. Till recently, bank-cheque bouncing
was only a civil offence in India. Now it has been made a criminal offence. Bouncing cheques could
lead to the imprisonment of the defaulter.
<p>The business laws of the countries fi rms want to operate in must be understood thoroughly as
ignorance of law is no excuse. Of special interest could be the laws relating to patents, environmental
issues, anti-trust laws, employment laws, investment and technology transfer laws, which must be
fully understood.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND THE CULTURAL DIVIDE
<p>An Example of a Company&rsquo;s Value System
ABB is a Swiss fi rm, is a supplier of power plants, electrical equipment in 140 countries of the
world. They have a single value system across their business empire spanning the 140 countries.
They believe that this has given them a competitive advantage over renowned fi rms like
Siemens, Alcatel-Alsthom and General Electric (GE).
<p>ABB has a concept of no geographic divide in the fi rm, it has only home markets and they
draw their strengths from their global entity. They have 500 managers who adapt to the local con-
ditions and yet go by the global strategies of the fi rm. They truly believe in staying local while
thinking global.
<p>From the stone age, people have been living in societies, made of persons of different disciplines
and work areas, but having a common link, which can be defi ned as their culture. Culture is made
up of people&rsquo;s customs, beliefs and ways of doing things. The evolution of religions, concepts of
family based on a husband and wife and their children are some aspects of culture as we see it today.
The members of a society start having similar attitude, beliefs, values and concepts of a good life.
A country&rsquo;s climate, its religions can infl uence its culture.
<p>Societies are formed with members of linked families. Religious affi liations, common profes-
sions, political affi liations too form societal groups, where the members of one group tend to behave
in a similar manner under similar circumstances and given the same type of stimuli.
<p>Overseas fi rms hire people from their host country. The compensation and competence rewards
should conform to the local customs. In many counties, hiring is encouraged from the area in which
the fi rm is based in the country. In India, the local factor is increasingly taking roots in several states.
For instance, the Karnataka government wants that fi rms operating in Karnataka should recruit people
from the state as far as possible. Each country has its own conventions regarding family pensions, equal
pay for male and female workers and retirement benefi ts. In certain countries, there is government
infl uence on the recruitment of staff.
<p>The attitude towards male and female workers is widely different across countries. India, China and
some other eastern countries have a distinct preference for male workers. Islamic countries have, at
times, banned the recruitment of females except for the medical profession and as teachers. In Japan, the
wives of workers are supposed to stay away from the workplace, unlike in the west where the spouses
of workers are invited to annual dinners and are encouraged to feel part of the fi rm&rsquo;s family.
<p>The hiring and retiring age is different in different countries. In some countries, age and experience
is valued, while in some the youth get all the benefi ts. In the US, an achiever gets the reward irrespec-
tive of his age and it is common to see young persons in the age group of 25&ndash;35 being promoted as
chief executive offi cers (CEOs) of companies. In some developing countries, junior-level executives are
kept under tension in the belief that they perform optimally only under pressure. In most countries,
because of the competitive environment, workers have to be result oriented if they hope to advance
in the fi rm.
<p>A major problem in India and several other countries, both developed and developing, is that of loss
of ethical values. The government offi cers, together with the fi rms have created a cover of corruption
in the entire business world, and this is true in varying degrees in most of the countries. In going
overseas, the dilemma of falling in line for getting the work done by paying hush money is great.
However, fi rms must be ready to bear with the consequences of being caught in the dirty game, which
could mean the end of their sojourn in that country and much more, like arrests, or penalties.</p>

<p>Market Potential of Countries 69
<p>The language of the host countries can be of great importance while doing business with them.
English has become the language of business the world over, yet countries like France, Germany and
Japan prefer to have the business contractual documentation done in their own languages. Knowledge
of languages, including the expertise in translating the document in English without loss of its subtle
candour is of utmost importance. English also has several versions&mdash; American English and Australian
English are a bit different from English spoken in the UK and in India.
<p>The language subtleties can cause a lot of problems if they are not understood properly. For example,
in the US, if a product were to be sold at cost, it would mean without giving any discount, while in
India it would mean selling without any profi t.
<p>Firms have to consider the cultural divide that exists between their country and the host country
and decide whether to adopt the host country&rsquo;s culture while doing business or stick to their own
culture. They can adopt the following three policies in this connection:
<p>1. Global
2. Multi-domestic
3. Hybrid
<p>In the global strategy, a fi rm can retain its home country&rsquo;s culture in the different nations they
do business in. English-speaking western countries bring their own culture with them while doing
business. The spread of western culture in India can be attributed, to some extent, to foreign fi rms
operating in India. The popularity of jeans, western attire, preference for western music and discos
can be attributed to this phenomenon. Managers working with global outlook are supposed to con-
form to the work ethics and cultural ambience of their home country. The American anti-trust laws
bind American fi rms across the world.
<p>In a multi-domestic strategy, the fi rm adapts its working style to the culture of the host country.
In India, the Swedish fi rm Bofors tried this by believing that the only way to get their work done
was through the use of speed money and it backfi red. Yet, local managers can perform better if they
are given the freedom of going by the host country&rsquo;s culture and following the dictum of &lsquo;When in
Rome, do as the Romans do.&rsquo;
<p>The ideal situation is to adopt a hybrid culture, which is a mixture of the home country&rsquo;s culture
and that of the host country. The cola fi rms use the cultural ethos of the host country. They use local
festivals to promote their products.
<p>Americans are hard negotiators in business, but once the deal is fi nalised they believe in informal-
ity, including getting to be on fi rst name basis. In some countries of Europe like Germany, this would
not be acceptable at all. Visitors to African countries are often in for a cultural shock as the way the
people dress and interact with foreigners is quite unusual. However, when a manager gets posted
to a particular country, he starts learning the ways of the host country and may after a while start
enjoying the same. It is best to spend some time as a tourist in the country where business is to be
conducted before actually shifting there. For the purpose of understanding, the main countries can
be grouped as far as their cultural ambience is concerned:
<p>1. English-speaking countries: Australia, UK, USA, Ireland, South Africa, New Zealand.
2. Middle East countries: Kuwait, Oman, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, UAE.
3. Far East countries: Singapore, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand.
4. The north European countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland.
5. Countries of middle Europe: Germany, Austria, Switzerland.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management70
<p>6. Southern European countries: France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium (these countries have a
Latin infl uence).
<p>7. East European countries: Russia, Turkey and the CIS countries.
8. South American countries: Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Brazil.
<p>For the sheer vastness and cultural diversities that exist, the following countries have been
singled out:
<p>1. India
2. China
3. Japan (its unique culture defi es clubbing with any group)
<p>The main area of understanding a country&rsquo;s culture could prove to be its value system. What fi rms
can do and can not do in a country must be fully understood and appreciated not just by the managers
operating in the host countries, but more importantly by the decision-makers in the home country.
<p>The economic level of the host country, at times dictates the work culture. In rich nations, man-
agers can afford to take holidays, while in poor countries, workers have to earn on a daily basis to feed
their families. The political system has a bearing on the culture of a country. In a democracy, citizens
have the right to work, but with the infl uence of worker unions, the right to strike work can become
prominent, especially for foreign fi rms. Labour laws, negotiation rules are areas of complexity unless
knowledgeable people are involved in solving the problems when they arise.
<p>Foreign fi rms can plan to go by the host country&rsquo;s cultural ethos. They must do so by calculating
the cost of adopting the culture. If the colour green is a must for all products, it could mean realign-
ing the entire range of products, packaging, advertising and promotion plans.
<p>There are a few major cultural differences amongst countries. In Islamic countries, the green colour
is preferred over other colours. In China, yellow is a colour associated with the gods and it can not be
used for mundane activities. White in most countries is the colour of purity and that is why a bride
wears white. In India, however, white is worn by widows and by others at the time of mourning.

<p>The HSBC Bank has been operating in several countries and can justifi ably be called a multinational
corporation (MNC). It describes its business credo as follows: Never underestimate the importance
of local knowledge and adds:
<p>To truly understand a country and its culture you have to be a part of it.
<p>That is why at HSBC we have local banks in more countries than anyone else does. And local
people staff all our offi ces round the world.
<p>It is their insight that allows us to recognize the fi nancial opportunities invisible to outsiders.
But those opportunities do not just benefi t our local customers.
<p>Innovations and ideas are shared throughout the HSBC network so that everyone who banks
with us can benefi t.
<p>Think of it as local knowledge that spans the globe.
<p>This type of hybrid mixing of cultural ambience has helped several MNCs achieve their global
objectives.
<p>TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT
The level of technology in countries differs and is related to their economic development. Most
technically advanced nations have research and development (R&amp;D) organisations in many fi elds in
place. Most of the developing nations either resort to buying the advance technology products from
the nations possessing them or they buy the technology from them. In India such technology transfers
or purchases from different countries have been in vogue for the last 50 years. The problems that
fi rms buying technology face are:
<p>1. Mostly old or outdated technology is sold to avoid direct competition.
2. The manufacturing equipment sold with the technology is usually sold at jacked up prices.
3. At times even used or reconditioned equipment has been sold.
4. There is pressure on the fi rms buying the technology to purchase completely built units (CBUs)
<p>and semi-knocked down (SKD) units, of the product under technology transfer for a period of
time or for a given number of units.
<p>This has resulted in fi rms going for reverse engineering of the product, where they buy a few
pieces of the product from a number of international fi rms, cannibalise the products to see how they
are inside and how they can be assembled locally. For this reason, it has been accepted by most fi rms
owning technology, that they cannot hold on to the technology on an exclusive basis in the rapidly
changing business environment in the midst of an information blitz.
<p>DEFINITION OF MARKET PROFILE
<p>The concept of market profi le stems from the idea that markets have a form of organisation determined
by time, price and volume. Each day, the market will develop a range for the day and a value area, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management72
<p>which represents an equilibrium point where there are an equal number of buyers and sellers. In this
area, prices never stay stagnant. They are constantly diverging and it is over here that market profi le
records this activity for traders to interpret.
<p>In relation to this, market profi le does not provide buy/sell recommendations but acts more like
a decision-making tool. It organises the data so that one can understand who is in control of the market,
what is perceived as fair value and the direction of the price move. It is possible to extract enough information
from market profi le for one to position one&rsquo;s trades more advantageously.
<p>In relation to this, market potential can be broadly defi ned as the total level of sales achievable
in a market assuming that every potential customer in that market is buying, that they are using
the product on every possible occasion, and that they are using the full amount of product on each
occasion.
<p>Market profi le can also be defi ned as a summary of the characteristics of a market, including in-
formation of typical purchasers and competitors, and often general information on the economy and
retailing patterns of an area.
<p>Because market profi le is a graphical organisation of price and time information, it reveals im-
portant pricing patterns from any market as they develop. By effectively organising price and time
information, it is possible for traders to see which price areas the market is accepting or which ones
it is rejecting and adjust their trading styles accordingly.
<p>The study of market profi le, thus, is quite important as it provides an indepth understanding of
the market and contributes to improved sales.
<p>SUMMARY
<p>Managers in the host country must be able to focus on the governmental attitude towards foreign
companies. They must learn about the tax laws, legal formalities and issues regarding laws governing
employment. Managers should have a good knowledge of the local customs, which affect consumer
behaviour.
<p>Cultures of countries are unique and fi rms appreciating this uniqueness would do well in the
countries they operate in. Technological advances, media avenues, retailing channels should be
dovetailed to suit the country. Managers have to learn that, unlike in their own country, the selling
action is controlled by various factors, including economic levels, infrastructure facilities, trans-
port, communication problems, which would be new to the outsider. Globalisation of business has
brought a large number of MNCs into each country, creating severe competitive situations. Man-
agers would do well to know the 4Ps of their competitors and plan the strategy of their own 4Ps
taking them into account. Product positioning, advertising and promotion, pricing and distribution
channels need an innovative approach to gain a sustainable competitive advantage, which is the key
factor in a fi rm&rsquo;s success.
<p>Technological supremacy can give fi rms a head start, but fi rms cannot keep that advantage for
long as in no time better me too products invade the market. Patents can create problems for fi rms
that copy, but in a host country, the legal tangles can sap profi ts in no time. Managers have to keep
themselves abreast with the latest products to be able to ensure that their own innovative products
keep giving them a head start.</p>

<p>International Marketing Game 2.1
<p>Assuming that following Part One of the International Marketing Game, teams have been formed,
the countries selected and the teams have decided about the product the company wants to export,
the teams need to do this: Scan the general business environment factors&mdash;demographic, social,
cultural, political, legal, macroeconomic, technological and global&mdash;that would have an impact on
the business of the company.
<p>The General Business Environment
<p>The following areas need to be studied, assessed, screened and monitored in the context of the
country for correct planning of marketing strategies:
<p> Demographic Factors: these are brought out in the census of the country, factors like, population
dispersion in towns, villages, income levels for families, sex ratios, religious numbers. Shifts
of population from villages to towns, from small towns to metro towns provide business op-
portunities, which no marketer can afford to miss. For a start low cost housing, clothing&rsquo;s,
transportation eateries are needed.
<p> Social Factors: like increase of working women in towns at all levels of income. It has given
rise to a big boost in demand for time-saving equipments like washing machines, vacuum
cleaners, microwave ovens, precooked foods. As women are coming out of homes, better
dresses, cosmetics, health gyms are required. With double family income, leisure time activ-
ities like holiday outings and travels are looking up.
<p> Cultural Factors: India is a land of rich cultural heritage. Its culture is rich and diverse. Mar-
keteers and advertisers take full advantage of knowing the buying season in different parts
of the country. During Deepavali, Hindus buy new clothes, household articles and exchange
gifts. Muslims do it on Eid, Christians on Christmas. The cultural ethos provides innumerable
<p>(continued)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management74
<p>themes for promoting sales. India is a vast country, with twenty languages spoken, several
religions and varied cultures and sub-cultures. For example, in Punjab, there is the Punjabi
culture and with in there is the Sikh subculture. Karnataka has the kannad culture and then
its district; Coorg has its own subculture.
<p> Political Factors: it was the political will of the then government, which led to LPG (liber-
alisation, privatisation and globalisation) in 1991. The infl ux of foreign capital, setting up
manufacturing bases, joint ventures all sprung up from then onwards. Changes in Cash Reserve
Ratio, taxation rates, duties are the political factors which have a major impact on business.
<p> Legal Factors: Supreme Court&rsquo;s directives have made car manufacturers change the emission
standards to Euro II. Diesel buses are on their way out in Delhi for the same reason. Ignoring
the law of the lands can be detrimental to the interests of the fi rms operating in the country.
<p> Macroeconomics Factors: the interest rates, taxes and duties, balance of payment situation
with the countries the fi rm wants to do business with, foreign currency rate fl uctuations have
major impacts on business and they must be well understood by the fi rm.
<p> Technology Factors: in the past decade, information technology, telecom, biotechnology,
genetic engineering have revolutionised the business scene in the world as also Indian busi-
ness scene.
<p> Global Factors: from the last decade, breaking of the Berlin wall with reunifi cation of Germany,
breaking up of the USSR, and more recent attack on the World Trade Centre in New York,
on the Indian Parliament, liberation of Afghanistan have affected business worldwide and
most countries are trying to recover the lost ground. On the brighter side the development in
the area of medicine, agriculture and farming cloning of the sheep have helped in the giant
strides the world is taking towards a better future for its children.

International Marketing is, to an extent, controlled and supported by a number of world organisations,
which are offshoots of the United Nations Organization (UNO), including the World Trade Organization.
These organisations have different countries where they help, monitor and even arbitrate in cases
of dispute. Hence, the students can get a wide view of these organisations that will help them in
approaching the right organisation in times if needed on behalf of the companies into international
marketing.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management76
<p>After the end of World War II, the nations of the world decided to start a monitoring organisation
to avoid the recurrence of war and they formed the United Nations Organization (UNO). The
UN accepts the fact that globalisation has brought about several advantages to the population
<p>of the world:
<p>1. Faster economic growth.
2. Higher standards of living.
3. New opportunities for international business.
<p>It has also given impetus to international crime, terrorism, drug and arm traffi cking, albeit un-
wittingly. The UN is determined to make globalisation an engine of positive change in the lives of
people living in poverty and misery. It should not be used to take people in the negative direction.
<p>The UN acknowledges the fact that poverty and inequality are the breeding grounds of confl icts.
Wars have claimed more than fi ve million lives in the last decade. Once the UN can come up with
confl ict prevention ideas, peace-building activities would become the harbinger of wealth for even
the poor nations, as the world would generate more wealth. The US- and the UK-led attack on Iraq
has brought the UN to a bit of oblivion, but its developmental agencies must take the initiative now
to further the aims of the UN.
<p>The UNO has since its inception tried to form political, commercial and socio-cultural bridges
between member nations. Its member bodies include United Nations Development Fund (UNDP),
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), International Trade Centre
and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). These bodies provide sup-
port to developing countries like India. It is, therefore, necessary to understand how these operate in
order to be able to take their assistance in business internationally. Besides these organisations, there
are international banking and trade organisations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO)
<p>In order to ensure free trade between member nations, the members of the UN set up the WTO, which
is supposed to monitor, regulate and assist in trade between nations. It started off as the General Agree-
ment on Trade and Tariff (GATT). This was basically for trade in merchandised goods. The WTO
includes goods, services like international telephones and creative works and intellectual property
rights. WTO is a formal structured organisation with its rules binding on its members. It is also meant
to settle disputes between nations. It has a mechanism for arbitration and has an appellate body where
nations aggrieved from the decisions of arbitration can appeal against the same.
<p>While the GATT had 128 members, the WTO has nearly 140 members, with more wanting to join.
The WTO has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. Its three main tasks are to:
<p>1. Administer and police the existing and new free trade zones in the world.
2. Oversee world trade practices.
3. Settle disputes.
<p>It was in 1995 that the WTO came into existence.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 77
<p>Background
<p>There were seven years of long fruitless negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
Then the new apex body, the WTO was formed. It came into existence on 1 January 1995. It is vested
with the authority to make rules and regulations governing international trade and to enforce the
same among the member nations. The WTO has faced some problems:
<p>1. European union farmers receive huge subsidies that give them an extra edge over others in
agricultural products in international trade.
<p>2. The multi-fi bre agreement for trade in textiles is another example of managed trade. The agree-
ment sets quotas for import to certain countries like the US, by other nations and the exporting
nations cannot exceed the quota limit.
<p>3. The removal of these and similar biases are planned by the WTO; it may, however, take some
time before the quota in textile trade is fully removed making it part of free trade.
<p>For the developing nations, however, WTO has some negative aspects as trade, fi nance and devel-
opment go hand in hand and developing nations need extra support for their growth. In fact, it can
be seen that the developing nations are also large markets for the developed nations and therefore
their development is in the interest of the developed nations too. It is imperative that a level-playing
fi eld is created between the two, the developing and the developed nations with special emphasis
on the weaker nations.
<p>The WTO needs to focus on the following areas:
<p>1. Managed trade: While the objective of free trade remains, yet most nations have non-tariff
based trade barriers. These include critical and almost impossible product specifi cations,
testing methods and source verifi cation of components and raw materials. Outsourcing from
international manufacturers, the essence of international trade is getting warped.
<p>2. Free trade: While trade may be free, does it also give a fair share of trade profi ts to the trading
partners? Profi ts, employment, foreign exchange earnings, technology upgrades, production
capacities, infrastructure development and building of institutions keeps the parity between
rich and developing nations a dream only.
<p>3. Market entry: Even within the WTO regime, powerful nations have the facility to safeguard
their interests while the weaker nations have no option but to follow the WTO rules. The best
option for these nations is to accept the existence of the WTO and then work to get the best
possible advantage of its rules. Each market has some internal forces at work like the political
set-up, level of liberalisation of the economy and its infrastructure. Developed nations have made
the entry of products from developing nations very diffi cult by introducing several measures,
product specifi cations being one of them.
<p>Hence, nations like India need to take the following steps to make themselves ready for the global
market:
<p>1. Have clear goals and strategies.
2. Use the country&rsquo;s strong points as strategic options and make correct assessment of bargaining
<p>power during the negotiation rounds of WTO meetings.
3. Ensure dynamic coordination between nations with similar ideas/problems.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management78
<p>Work on these issues has been going on and it needs to be intensifi ed with a sense of urgency.
The WTO, it must be understood is here to stay and it would be prudent to get the best out of it. It
is for everyone&rsquo;s benefi t in international trade. Nations should help improve the competitiveness of
its trade with help in getting access to better technology, better infrastructure support and manage-
ment. There could be assistance to domestic trade to enable it to compete with world players on a
level-playing fi eld.
<p>India as a member of the WTO has to accept and honour its rules. India should therefore have an
integrated plan of complying with WTO rules. It could be done in the following manner:
<p>1. Help fi rms get better technology and management, organise state of the art infrastructure
support to make them competitive in the country and globally. Technology should meet with
the best in the range available anywhere in the world.
<p>2. Remove internal hurdles for fi rms to prepare them for international competition.
3. Phase the introduction of globalisation and liberalisation to give breathing time to fi rms to
<p>adjust to international competition.
4. Help in strengthening antidumping institutions and competition by identifying the areas of
<p>dumping, the damage it is causing to the affected countries. The reasons for dumping including
industry capacity and fi nancial muscle should be understood.
<p>5. The WTO accepts the link between law and economics. Legal battles fought in foreign countries
are expensive. Experts and consultants in the area of the WTO should be roped in. They should
be able to coordinate with their international counterparts.
<p>WORLD BANK
<p>The World Bank is a group of fi ve institutions&mdash;the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the International Development
Association (IDA), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
<p>The aim of these agencies is to reduce poverty around the world by assisting the poor nations in
their economic development.
<p>International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
<p>The Bank provides loans to middle-income countries and credit-worthy poorer countries. The Bank
obtains 90 per cent of its capital through the sale of bonds in the international capital markets. In 1999,
the Bank committed US$ 29 billion for institution building, governance, economic policies and social
protection, which got the bulk of the amount. This was meant mainly for the removal of poverty with
support to the social sector. The total lending of the Bank is to the tune of US$ 300 billion.
<p>The IBRD is one of the fi ve institutions that forms the World Bank group. It came into existence on
27 December 1945. The IBRD is an international organisation whose original mission was to fi nance
the reconstruction of nations devastated by World War II. Now its mission has expanded to fi ght
poverty by means of fi nancing states. Its operation is maintained through payments as regulated by
the member states.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 79
<p>The IBRD provides loans to governments and public enterprises. As most developing countries
have considerably lower credit ratings, the IBRD can lend to countries at interest rates that are
usually quite attractive to them, even after adding a small margin (about 1 per cent) to cover admin-
istrative overheads.
<p>The IBRD was established mainly as a vehicle for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan after
World War II, with an additional mandate to foster economic growth in developing countries in Africa,
Asia and Latin America. Originally the bank focused mainly on large-scale infrastructure projects,
building highways, airports and power plants. As developmental activities started taking place in
Japan and other European member nations, the IBRD shifted its focus entirely on the developing
countries. Since the early 1990s, the IBRD has also provided fi nancing to the post-socialist states of
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
<p>The International Development Association (IDA)
<p>The IDA provides loans at very low rates to the poorest nations of the world. The bulk of IDA&rsquo;s resources
come from contributions from the richer IDA member countries, who are asked to replenish their
contributions every three years. The loan repayments start only after a grace period of 10 years.
<p>The IDA was created on 24 September 1960 and is a specialised agency of the UN. The IDA is a
part of the World Bank. It helps the world&rsquo;s poorest countries reduce poverty by providing them
interest-free loans and some grants for programmes aimed at boosting economic growth and im-
proving living conditions. The IDA funds help these countries deal with the complex challenges they
face in striving to meet the millennium development goals.
<p>The IBRD and IDA are run on the same lines. They share the same staff and headquarters, report
to the same president and evaluate projects with the same rigorous standards.
<p>The IDA lends to those countries that had an income of less than US$ 1,025 per person in 2005 and
lack the fi nancial ability to borrow from the IBRD. Some &lsquo;blend borrower&rsquo; countries like India and
Indonesia are eligible for IDA loans because of their low per person incomes although they are also
eligible for IBRD loans because they are fi nancially credit-worthy. Eighty-one countries are cur-
rently eligible to borrow from the IDA. Together these countries are home to 2.5 billion people, half of
the total population of the developing world. Most of these people, an estimated 1.5 billion, survive
on incomes of US$ 2 or less a day (see Table 3.1).

<p>2. Investment in people, in education and health, especially in the struggle against HIV/AIDS,
malaria and TB.
<p>3. Expansion of borrower capacity to provide basic services and ensure accountability for public
resources.
<p>4. Recovery from civil strife, armed confl ict and natural disaster.
5. Promotion of trade and regional integration.
<p>The IDA carries out analytical studies to build a knowledge base that allows for the intelligent
design of policies to reduce poverty. The IDA also advises governments on ways to broaden the base
of its economic growth and to protect the poor from economic shocks.
<p>The IDA also coordinates donor assistance to provide relief for poor countries that cannot manage
their debt-service burden. The increasing integration of world markets and societies has allowed
China, India and many other developing countries to achieve faster growth through expanded foreign
direct investments (FDIs) and access to export markets. The IDA is re-invigorating its work in trade
to assist the poorest and most marginalised countries to limit adverse disruptions from globalisation
and to enhance net benefi ts from it. The IDA&rsquo;s work in this area emphasises measures to improve the
investment climate, enhance regional integration, particularly in Africa, strengthen competitiveness,
remove barriers to the markets of industrial countries and forge partnerships that enable the acquisition
of appropriate skills and infrastructure.
<p>International Finance Corporation (IFC)
<p>The IFC is the largest multilateral source of loan and equity fi nancing for private sector projects in
the developing world. It helps governments in creating conditions for the fl ow of both domestic and
foreign private savings and investments. It supports the role of market investors. It acts as a catalyst
in the developing world to prove that investments can be made profi tably.
<p>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
<p>This agency helps foreign investments in developing countries by covering non-commercial risks
like political risks, through insurance (guarantee). MIGA is a multilateral risk mitigating agency,
promoting FDI into developing countries by:
<p>1. Insuring investors against political or non-commercial risks.
2. Mediating disputes between investors and governments.
3. Advising governments on attracting investment.
4. Sharing information through online investment information services.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE: MIGA OFFSETS LENDERS&rsquo; RISK CONCERNS IN VIETNAM POWER
PROJECT
<p>Along the bustling tree-lined streets of Ho Chi Minh City, merchants wearing traditional Vietnamese
ao dais invite customers into brightly lit shops, and restaurant owners beckon passers-by into their air
conditioned establishments. In homes on the outskirts of the city, refrigerators keep food cold and
electric fans keep the populace cool.
<p>As a member of the World Bank group, MIGA&rsquo;s mission is to promote FDI into developing coun-
tries to help support economic growth, reduce poverty and improve people&rsquo;s lives.
<p>The development needs today are stark. Nearly 28 per cent of the world&rsquo;s population of 1.7 billion
people lives on less than a dollar a day. Billions of people live without access to safe drinking water
or sanitary living conditions. In some countries, children cannot attend school because there is no
electricity to light the classrooms or no roads to get to school. The list goes on. Developing country
governments cannot shoulder the burden, fi nancially or technically, of addressing these needs by
themselves. FDIs help these countries meet these requirements.
<p>Foreign direct investors can play a critical role in reducing poverty by building roads, providing
clean water, electricity and, above all, providing jobs. By taking on these tasks, the private sector can
help economies grow. This helps governments use funds on addressing acute social needs. Foreign
investors can take advantage of the opportunities to make profi table investments.
<p>MIGA AND FDI
<p>Concerns about investment environments and perceptions of political risk often inhibit foreign direct
investment, with the majority of fl ows going to just a handful of countries and leaving the world&rsquo;s
poorest economies largely ignored. MIGA addresses these concerns by providing three key ser-
vices: political risk insurance for foreign investments in developing countries, technical assistance
to improve investment climates and promote investment opportunities in developing countries, and
dispute mediation services, to remove possible obstacles to future investment.
<p>MIGA&rsquo;s operational strategy plays to our foremost strength in the marketplace&mdash;attracting investors
and private insurers into diffi cult operating environments. The agency&rsquo;s strategy focuses on specifi c
areas where we can make the greatest difference:
<p> Infrastructure development is an important priority for MIGA, given the estimated need for
US$ 230 billion a year solely for new investment to deal with the rapidly growing urban centres
and underserved rural populations in developing countries.
<p> Frontier markets&mdash;high-risk and/or low-income countries and markets&mdash;represent both a
challenge and an opportunity for the agency. These markets typically have the most need
and stand to benefi t the most from foreign investment, but are not well served by the private
market.
<p> Investment into confl ict-affected countries is another operational priority for the agency. While
these countries tend to attract considerable donor goodwill once confl ict ends, aid fl ows
eventually start to decline, making private investment critical for reconstruction and growth.
With many investors wary of potential risks, political risk insurance becomes essential to
moving investments forward.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management82
<p> South&ndash;South investments (investments between developing countries) are contributing a greater
proportion of FDI fl ows. But the private insurance market in these countries is not always
suffi ciently developed and national export credit agencies often lack the ability and capacity
to offer political risk insurance.
<p>MIGA offers comparative advantages in all of these areas&mdash;from our unique package of products
and ability to restore the business community&rsquo;s confi dence, to our ongoing collaboration with the
public and private insurance market to increase the amount of insurance available to investors.
<p>MIGA gives private investors the confi dence and comfort they need to make sustainable invest-
ments in developing countries. As part of the World Bank Group, and having as our shareholders
both host countries and investor countries, MIGA brings security and credibility to an investment that
is unmatched. Our presence in a potential investment can literally transform a no-go into a go. We act
as a potent deterrent against government actions that may adversely affect investments. And even if
disputes do arise, our leverage with host governments frequently enables us to resolve differences to
the mutual satisfaction of all parties.
<p>MIGA is a leader when it comes to assessing and managing political risks, developing new
products and services, and fi nding innovative ways to meet client needs. But we don&rsquo;t stop there.
We also provide expert advice to help countries attract and retain quality foreign investment, and a
host of online services to make sure investors know about business opportunities in our developing
member countries.
<p>MIGA can be the difference between a make or break, by providing that all-critical lynchpin that
enables a complex transaction to go ahead. MIGA offers innovative coverage of the non-traditional
sub-sovereign risks that often accompany water and other infrastructure projects. We can also cover
interest rate hedging instruments, as we did for a power project in Vietnam, as well as provide capital
markets guarantees, which we recently did for residential mortgage-backed securities in Latvia.
<p>PRI market&mdash;MIGA complements the activities of other investment insurers and works with
partners through its coinsurance and reinsurance programmes. By doing so, we are able to expand
the capacity of the political risk insurance industry to insure investments, as well as to encourage
private sector insurers into transactions they would not have otherwise undertaken.
<p>Since its inception in 1988, MIGA has issued nearly 800 guarantees worth more than US$ 14.7 billion
for projects in 91 developing countries. MIGA is committed to promoting socially, economically, and
environmentally sustainable projects that are above all, developmentally responsible. They have
widespread benefi ts, for example, generating jobs and taxes, and transferring skills and know-how.
Local communities often receive signifi cant secondary benefi ts through improved infrastructure.
Projects encourage similar local investments and spur the growth of local businesses. We ensure
that projects are aligned with World Bank Group country assistance strategies, and integrate the best
environmental, social, and governance practices into our work.
<p>MIGA specialises in facilitating investments in high-risk, low-income countries such as in Africa
and confl ict-affected areas, which account for 42 per cent of our portfolio. By partnering with the
World Bank and others, MIGA is able to leverage fi nance for guarantee trust funds in these diffi cult
or frontier markets. The agency also focuses on supporting complex infrastructure projects and
promoting investments between developing countries.
<p>MIGA&rsquo;s technical assistance services also play an integral role in catalysing FDI by helping devel-
oping countries defi ne and implement strategies to promote investment. MIGA develops and deploys
tools and technologies to support the spread of information on investment opportunities. Thousands
of users take advantage of our suite of online investment information services, which complement
country-based capacity-building work.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 83
<p>The agency uses its legal services to further smooth possible impediments to investment. Through
its dispute mediation programme, MIGA helps governments and investors resolve their differences,
and ultimately improve the country&rsquo;s investment climate.
<p>MIGA OPERATIONS IN CHINA
<p>MIGA has been very active in supporting FDI into China. The current MIGA portfolio in China con-
sists of fi ve contracts for a maximum liability of US$ 91 million (this does not include the Shenzhen
water project, which was approved by the MIGA Board in FY 2005 with a maximum liability of
US$ 45 million). There has been a recent resurgence in interest for MIGA coverage, particularly for
projects that involve sub-sovereign risk like water. MIGA&rsquo;s strategy is to prioritise guarantees in sec-
tors that are government priorities like infrastructure and water. Further, MIGA is eager to support
new investments through both its guarantees and technical assistance programmes in line with China&rsquo;s
western and northeast regional development strategy.
<p>In support of China&rsquo;s &lsquo;go global&rsquo; strategy, MIGA cosponsored a workshop in June 2005 with the
Ministry of Finance, China Ex&ndash;Im Bank and the IFC, in collaboration with NDRC, Sinosure, China&rsquo;s
state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, Ministry of Commerce, and
Chubb Insurance. The workshop brought together some 200 participants, of which two-thirds were
from Chinese companies and the remainder from relevant central and provincial governments and
international organisations.
<p>MIGA has plans to follow up the workshop in several ways. First, MIGA is collaborating with the
Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) in investigations and analyses on outward investment
from China. The study has three main parts:
<p>1. Interviews and case studies on selected overseas investors.
2. A survey of 150 Chinese companies investing overseas or with an interest in investing overseas.
3. Preparation of a report summarising fi ndings and presentation at a FY 2006 IFC seminar on
<p>South&ndash;South investment that will be convened in India. This work is in keeping with MIGA&rsquo;s
established work programme in China as well as with MIGA&rsquo;s corporate strategy with regard
to the promotion of South&ndash;South investment.
<p>In addition, MIGA has recently signed a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the
China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The purpose of the new MOU is to expand
the cooperation between MIGA and Sinosure, particularly in the area of supporting Chinese out-
ward investment by providing coinsurance and reinsurance for projects. Both parties have recognised
the following key aspects for cooperation:
<p>1. Development of better communications and information exchange between MIGA and Sinosure.
2. Organising training programmes in underwriting and reinsurance.
3. Development of joint efforts to reach out to Chinese companies wishing to invest abroad.
4. Staff exchanges focused on specifi c underwriting efforts.
5. Forming a technical team to review the issues of documentation harmonisation and the like.
<p>MIGA has conducted a number of programmes to support the country&rsquo;s investment promotion and
capacity-building activities. MIGA is collaborating with the IFC&rsquo;s China Project Development Facility </p>

<p>(CPDF) in undertaking a competitive benchmarking exercise of Sichuan Province at the request of the
Sichuan Investment Promotion Bureau (SIPB). The survey covers fi rms in 10 municipalities engaged
in food processing, electronics, machinery/machine building, chemicals, pharmaceuticals/traditional
Chinese medicine and will contribute to the development of an integrated provincial investment
promotion strategy. MIGA is also undertaking a series of investment promotion workshops with
the CPDF. Two workshops were held in 2004 and a third will be held in November 2005 to pre-
sent the benchmarking fi ndings and discuss how to make use of them in strategic planning efforts at
the provincial and municipal levels.
<p>MIGA has begun to work with the World Bank&rsquo;s Beijing offi ce to provide integrated support to the
north-east provinces. Specifi cally, the Heilongjiang Investment Promotion Agency (HIPA), Harbin
Economic Cooperation Promotion Bureau (HECPB) and the Harbin Development Zone (HDZ)
requested that MIGA undertake a needs assessment of their agencies to identify their respective
capacity-building requirements and as a step toward developing an integrated provincial investment.
In late May 2005, a MIGA team visited Harbin to undertake the assessment. The needs assessment
drew upon discussions with management and staff of these agencies, meetings with municipal and
provincial offi cials and interviews with foreign investors. MIGA is also considering benchmarking
key industries in Heilongjiang Province against other provinces.
<p>INFORMATION SERVICES
<p>MIGA signed a cooperation agreement in March 2004 with the SIPB&rsquo;s Information Resource Centre,
which is providing investment information content to MIGA for distribution to potential in-
vestors via the FDI Xchange. Other online services partners in China include the Dongguan Foreign
Investment Promotion Centre (DGFIPC), China Foreign Direct Investment (China FDI) and the Hong
Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). MIGA&rsquo;s online investment promotion services
(www.fdixchange.com and www.ipanet.net) feature 380 documents on investment opportunities and
the related business, legal and regulatory environment in China. Some 336 China-based individuals
and organisations are members of IPAnet.
<p>International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
<p>This agency provides for dispute settlements through conciliation or arbitration between private
foreign investors and the government of the host country. On a number of occasions in the past, the
World Bank as an institution and the president of the Bank in his personal capacity have assisted in
mediation or conciliation of investment disputes between governments and private foreign investors.
The creation of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in 1966 was in
part intended to relieve the president of the Bank and the staff of the burden of becoming involved
in such disputes. But the Bank&rsquo;s overriding consideration in creating the ICSID was the belief that an
institution specially designed to facilitate the settlement of investment disputes between governments
and foreign investors could help to promote increased fl ows of international investment.
<p>The ICSID was established under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (hereafter referred to as the Convention) which came into force
on 14 October 1966. The ICSID has an administrative council and a secretariat. The administrative </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 85
<p>council is chaired by the World Bank&rsquo;s president and consists of one representative of each state
which has ratifi ed the Convention. Annual meetings of the council are held in conjunction with the
joint Bank/Fund annual meetings.
<p>The ICSID is an autonomous international organisation. However, it has close links with the World
Bank. All of ICSID&rsquo;s members are also members of the Bank. Unless a government makes a contrary
designation, its Governor for the Bank sits ex offi cio on ICSID&rsquo;s administrative council. The expenses
of the ICSID secretariat are fi nanced out of the Bank&rsquo;s budget, although the costs of individual
proceedings are borne by the parties involved.
<p>Pursuant to the Convention, the ICSID provides facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of dis-
putes between member countries and investors who qualify as nationals of other member countries.
Recourse to the ICSID&rsquo;s conciliation and arbitration process is entirely voluntary. However, once the
parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither can unilaterally withdraw
its consent. Moreover, all ICSID contracting states, whether or not parties to the dispute, are required
by the Convention to recognise and enforce the ICSID arbitral awards.
<p>Besides providing facilities for conciliation and arbitration under the ICSID Convention, it has
since 1978 had a set of additional facility rules authorising the ICSID secretariat to administer
certain types of proceedings between states and foreign nationals which fall outside the scope of the
Convention. These include conciliation and arbitration proceedings where either the state party or
the home state of the foreign national is not a member of ICSID. Additional facility conciliation and
arbitration are also available for cases where the dispute is not an investment dispute provided it relates
to a transaction which has features that distinguishes it from an ordinary commercial transaction.
The additional facility rules further allow the ICSID to administer a type of proceedings not pro-
vided for in the Convention, namely, fact-fi nding proceedings to which any state and foreign national
may have recourse if they wish to institute an inquiry to examine and report on facts.
<p>A third activity of the ICSID in the fi eld of settlement of disputes has consisted in the secretary-
general of the ICSID accepting to act as the appointing authority of arbitrators for ad hoc (that is,
non-institutional) arbitration proceedings. This is most commonly done in the context of arrangements
for arbitration under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL), which are specially designed for ad hoc proceedings.
<p>Provisions on ICSID arbitration are commonly found in investment contracts between govern-
ments of member countries and investors from other member countries. Advance consents by
governments to submit investment disputes to ICSID arbitration can also be found in about 20 invest-
ment laws and in over 900 bilateral investment treaties. Arbitration under the auspices of the ICSID
is similarly one of the main mechanisms for the settlement of investment disputes under four
recent multilateral trade and investment treaties (the North American Free Trade Agreement, the
Energy Charter Treaty, the Cartagena Free Trade Agreement and the Colonia Investment Protocol
of Mercosur).
<p>Under the ICSID Convention, ICSID proceedings need not be held at its headquarters in Washington,
DC. The parties to an ICSID proceeding are free to agree to conduct their proceeding at any other
place. The ICSID Convention contains provisions that facilitate advance stipulations for such other
venues when the place chosen is the seat of an institution with which the Centre has an arrange-
ment for this purpose. The ICSID has to date entered into such arrangements with the Permanent Court
of Arbitration at The Hague, the regional arbitration centres of the Asian-African Legal Consultative
Committee at Cairo and Kuala Lumpur, the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration
at Melbourne, the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre at Sydney, the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre, the GCC Commercial Arbitration Centre at Bahrain and the German Institution </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management86
<p>of Arbitration (DIS). These arrangements have proved their usefulness in many ICSID cases and have
helped to promote cooperation between ICSID and these institutions in several other respects.
<p>The number of cases submitted to the Centre has increased signifi cantly in recent years. These
include cases brought under the ICSID Convention and cases brought under the ICSID&rsquo;s additional
facility rules. In addition to its dispute settlement activities, the ICSID carries out advisory and
research activities relevant to its objectives and has a number of publications. The Centre collaborates
with other World Bank Group units in meeting requests by governments for advice on investment
and arbitration law. The publications of the Centre include multi-volume collections of investment
laws of the world and of investment treaties, which are periodically updated by the ICSID staff. Since
April 1986, the Centre has published a semi-annual law journal entitled ICSID Review-Foreign Investment
Law Journal. The journal was recently rated as one of the top 20 international and comparative law
journals in the US.
<p>Since 1983, the Centre has also cosponsored, with the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and the International Court of Arbitration, colloquia on
topics of current interest in the area of international arbitration. Other conference activities involving
the Centre are described in the ICSID Annual Report.
<p>ICSID has an Administrative Council, chaired by the World Bank&rsquo;s President, and a Secretariat.
It provides facilities for the conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes between member
countries and individual investors.
<p>During the past decade, with the proliferation of bilateral investment treaties (BITs), most of which
refer present and future investment disputes to the ICSID, the caseload of the ICSID has substantially
increased. As of 30 June 2005, the ICSID had registered 184 cases more than 30 of which were pending
against Argentina. Argentina&rsquo;s economic crisis and subsequent Argentine government measures led
several foreign investors to fi le cases against Argentina.
<p>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF)
<p>The IMF is an international organisation of 184 member countries. It was created under the patronage
of the UNO. It is a body that regulates smooth compensation for balance of payment defi cits. Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs) are assets allotted by the IMF on the basis of a country&rsquo;s gross domestic
product (GDP) and share of world trade.
<p>The IMF was established to promote international monetary cooperation, exchange stability and
orderly exchange arrangements; to foster economic growth and high levels of employment; and to
provide temporary fi nancial assistance to countries to help ease balance of payments adjustment.
<p>The IMF is meant to do the following:
<p>1. Assist in international monitory transactions and cooperation.
2. Promote exchange rate stability and proper exchange arrangements.
3. Help in establishment of multilateral payment systems and elimination of foreign exchange
<p>restrictions.
4. Provide bridge loans for meeting temporary adjustments of balance of payments.
5. Offer concessional aid to low-income member countries.
6. The IMF works to promote global growth and economic stability and thereby prevent economic
<p>crisis by encouraging countries to adopt sound economic policies.</p>
<br>

<p>International Organisations 87
<p>7. Technical assistance and training are offered&mdash;mostly free of charge&mdash;to help member countries
strengthen their capacity to design and implement effective policies. Technical assistance is
offered in several areas including fi scal policy, monetary and exchange rate policies, banking
and fi nancial system supervision and regulation, and statistics.
<p>8. In the event that member countries do experience diffi culties fi nancing their balance of payments,
the IMF is also a fund that can be tapped to help in recovery.

<p>UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE
AND DEVELOPMENT (UNCTAD)
<p>Established in 1964, UNCTAD promotes the development-friendly integration of developing countries
into the world economy. It has progressively evolved into an authoritative knowledge-based institution
whose work aims to help shape current policy debates and thinking on development, with a particular
focus on ensuring that domestic policies and international action are mutually supportive in bringing
about sustainable development.
<p>The organisation works to fulfi l the following three key functions:
<p>1. It functions as a forum for intergovernmental deliberations, supported by discussions with
experts and exchanges of experience aimed at consensus building.
<p>2. It undertakes research, policy analysis and data collection for the debates of government
representatives and experts.
<p>3. It provides technical assistance tailored to the specifi c requirements of developing countries, with
special attention to the needs of the least developed countries and of economies in transition.
When appropriate, UNCTAD cooperates with other organisations and donor countries in the
delivery of technical assistance.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management88
<p>Besides this, UNCTAD also undertakes the following tasks:
<p>1. It scans the global economy and its impact on the development process.
2. It analyses the macroeconomic policies of governments regarding cooperation between
<p>nations.
3. It understands the development challenges and successful experiences and dovetails them to
<p>developing countries and countries going into market economy.
4. Assist developing countries in their debt repayments.
5. Prepares a database and provides trade and development-related information.
6. Helps poor nations to integrate with the global economy.
<p>UNCTAD interacts and cooperates with a variety of other organisations within and outside the
UN system. These include the following:
<p>1. The WTO
The WTO and UNCTAD have joined forces to ensure a better functioning of the multilateral
<p>trading system. In April 2003, the organisations signed an MOU providing for cooperation
and consultations on their technical assistance activities and for the conduct of joint studies on
selected issues. These agencies interact frequently and the intergovernmental processes in both
organisations are often attended by the same government representatives.
<p>2. The International Trade Centre (ITC)
The ITC is jointly sponsored by UNCTAD and WTO for operational, enterprise-oriented aspects
<p>of trade development, with an emphasis on trade promotion. In contrast to UNCTAD, whose
technical assistance is primarily tailored to governments, ITC&rsquo;s technical assistance focuses on
assisting businesses in developing countries. Both UNCTAD and WTO are represented in the
joint advisory group supervising ITC&rsquo;s work and UNCTAD has a number of joint technical
assistance activities with ITC.
<p>3. The UN Regional Commissions and UNDP
UNCTAD cooperates with these international entities on a project-by-project basis, be it in
<p>relation to research projects, joint workshops and seminars, or technical assistance. Since
UNCTAD has no representatives in the fi eld, the UNDP country offi ces are also used to support
UNCTAD activities in various countries.
<p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE CENTRE
<p>Since 1964, the ITC has helped the business sectors of developing and transition economies to develop
exports. The goal of ITC is to help developing countries to achieve sustainable human development
through exports, with an emphasis on competitiveness. They are known as a practical agency that
has embraced reform, encourages partnerships and fosters innovation.
<p> It shares the social development goals of the UN, the WTO, the Bretton Woods institutions (the
World Bank and the IMF) and, more generally, of the international development community. It con-
tributes to the UN&rsquo;s millennium development goals, specifi cally to the goals relating to fostering
global partnership for development, reducing poverty, promoting gender equality and ensuring
environmental sustainability.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 89
<p>It is the technical cooperation agency of UNCTAD/WTO for operational and enterprise oriented
aspects of international trade development. It works with developing nations and nations with
economies in transition to set up trade promotion plans to expand exports and improve their import
operations.
<p>ITC&rsquo;s Goals
<p>1. Facilitate the integration of developing and transition economy fi rms into the multilateral
trading system.
<p>2. Support national efforts to design and implement trade development strategies.
3. Strengthen key trade support services, both public and private.
4. Improve export performance in sectors of critical importance and opportunity.
5. Foster international competitiveness within the business community as a whole and among
<p>small and medium-sized fi rms in particular.
<p>Some of ITC&rsquo;s technical programmes include:
<p>1. Strategic and operational market research.
2. Business advisory services.
3. Trade information management.
4. Export training capacity development.
5. Sector-specifi c product and market development.
6. Trade in services.
7. International purchasing and supply chain management.
<p>UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
ORGANIZATION (UNIDO)
<p>United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) is the UN&rsquo;s specialised industrial
agency, mandated to promote industrial development and international industrial cooperation.
<p> This agency addresses poverty reduction by focusing on enabling the poor to earn a living, rather
than providing help to deal with the symptoms of poverty. As such UNIDO focuses on private sector
development and agro-industrial development, including rural energy for productive use, by sup-
porting the development of clusters, rural development and women entrepreneurs, improving business
environment and institutional support and strengthening business information services.
<p>Further, UNIDO offers programmes to support market access and access to fi nance while provid-
ing assistance to allow for small and medium enterprises to face global competition.
<p>Second, UNIDO helps enterprises to build up technical infrastructure required to participate in
international trade and strengthens key export sectors that require support services in upgrading the
productive and export capacities. The programme draws on UNIDO&rsquo;s technical expertise and on its
strong linkages with external partners as well as on inter-organisational cooperation with bodies such
as the EU, WTO, UNCTAD, ITC and ISO.</p>
<br>

<p>Hence, UNIDO helps to improve the living conditions of people and promotes global prosperity
by offering tailor-made solutions for industrial development. It associates with governments and
private industry to develop industrial capacities.
<p>MARKET GLOBALISATION
<p>Firms usually start marketing their products in their own country, that is, in the domestic market. Once
established as a known brand and an accepted supplier of goods, they need to diversify their markets
and the fi rst step in that direction is exports to another country. Excess production, which cannot
fi nd market in the country of origin, is the starting point of exports. Later on, fi rms do take up special
production of goods for exports. Some others build an export bank (inventory) to avoid any clash
with the demands of the domestic market. Firms have to realise that the product, which is regarded
to be giving value for money and fulfi lling the customer&rsquo;s need at home, must do the same in the
overseas market.
<p>Once a fi rm has decided to get established in the export market, it has to understand the busi-
ness environment of the foreign country. The 4Ps&mdash;product, price, placement and promotion&mdash;may
not have the same relevance outside the home country.
<p> City-states initially traded through the barter system. City-states traded products that they had
with the product that they needed with other city-states. The same kind of trade takes place even
today although the scene is much more complex now with several countries and myriads of products
having global access.
<p>In India, exports are a fi rm&rsquo;s imperatives due to following reasons:
<p>1. The partial convertibility of the rupee, which gives the foreign exchange needed to exporters
for their imports for production.
<p>2. Need to achieve economies of scale of production for lowering costs and making prices
competitive for exports too.
<p>3. With multinational corporations (MNCs) getting a foothold in India, fi rms need to have greater
markets, which India cannot provide.
<p>4. The intangible benefi ts are the improvement of product quality, improvements in communication
systems.
<p>5. Upgradation of technology.
6. Cost reduction due to large scale of manufacture.
7. Utilisation of human resources like in the IT sector, where India has a large workforce.
8. Internationalisation of Indian brands.
<p>Let us discuss the negative factors of going for exports:
<p>1. Low image of the country as a supplier of quality goods. This is gradually changing.
2. Firm&rsquo;s culture, which does not give the required fi llip to exports.
3. Lack of experience in international business and the fear of the unknown.
4. Cultural differences between nations.
5. Entry barriers in some countries, governmental controls and in some cases, like the US, the
<p>existence of quota systems for exports.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>International Organisations 91
<p>There are some common factors as discussed next:
<p>1. Balance of payment between trading nations.

<p>Cultural Aspects of Global Business
<p>Every country has its own cultural and social ethos that governs, more than the country&rsquo;s government,
the way the populace of the country would behave in a given circumstance. These factors determine
the norms of behaviour besides settings standards of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts for a community. In large countries
like India, there is a great cultural divide across the country. However, even amidst the diversity,
the basic unity can be seen. In smaller countries, the cultural, moral and social scenario remains the
same but for minor changes. International marketers need to understand these nuances of the cultural
spread in the context of the host country. Companies need to know the factors that determine product
usage, the management process and communication system. However, it must be understood that
decent behaviour, politeness and good communication adds to the marketing effect everywhere.
Most foreign companies use local managers in order to fully assimilate the cultural ambience of the
host country and to fully use it to their benefi t. See how Pepsi and Coke use the Indian festivals to
boost their sales through seasonal promotions.
<p>Culture is a set of values and beliefs that have been handed down through generations and there-
fore can be considered to be an acquired entity rather than an inborn commitment. Companies should
try to understand the value system but not try to change it. International players do have an impact
on the cultural milieu of the countries as they bring in their own culture that is practised by their
expatriate managers. Culture gives pride to the population, gives rise to prejudices and these create
needs of products. Culture determines people&rsquo;s attitude towards work, leisure time activities, suc-
cess and achievement, need for change and time management. A good market would locate business
opportunities through the cultural spectrum. For example, if people have more leisure time, then
sports goods, leisure time activity equipment, holiday packages will sell well.
<p>It is widely believed that culture is not inherent but is learnt. Different areas of culture are inter-
related and shared culture distinguishes people in one area from another. Culture guides people to
respond to situations and since it has been learnt, it is diffi cult to change. Marketeers need to fi nd
some common reference point between cultures of different countries, because it is the culture of a
country that defi nes the behaviour norms and reactions to outside stimuli of its people.
<p>The home country objectives of business are dependent on its cultural ethos and transposing them
on to another country would need defi ning the cultural ethos of that country. If the marketers try to
impose their country&rsquo;s culture on another country, it may complicate the issue and hence the cultural
biases of one&rsquo;s own country must be taken out while formulating objectives of business for other </p>

<p>countries. There may be, however, products that have universal appeal and they would not need
any such action.
<p>Product Innovation
<p>While a product may be introduced as an innovative one in one country, it may already be in a stage
of maturity in some other country. Product acceptance in new countries takes the following steps:
<p>1. Product knowledge or awareness, which comes from advertising.
2. Interest in the product makes prospective customers obtain more information about the
<p>product.
3. Judgement about the value of the product is made at this stage.
4. The next step is the trial stage when the customer tries out the product before adopting it.
<p>The rate of adoption of a product depends on the following considerations:
<p>1. Competitive advantage of the product and also the competitive advantage of its country of
origin like low-cost labour, balance of payment situation and currency rates.
<p>2. Acceptance of change. Some countries like the US need to change their products all the time,
while countries like Japan and India prefer to stay with tried and trusted products unless
something of great interest comes along.
<p>3. Ease of usage of the product and its compatibility with other products in use.
4. Ease of trial helps in ensuring product usage.
5. Availability of information when needed is vital for customer trying to make a change.
<p>Major difference in culture can be seen in the culture of the USA and Japan. While the USA has
individualistic management style, Japan&rsquo;s management is based on group decisions.
<p>International marketers must take the cultural factors into account to succeed in their business.
<p>International Market Research
<p>Companies are, at the beginning, unaware of the behaviour of the international markets. While they
have a gut feeling about the domestic market and know its trends to a large extent, to most fi rms,
the international market initially seems like a black box. Companies must reduce the risk of market
uncertainties by organising proper market research in countries they want to do business in. Questions
like whether proper distribution networks can be established in the host country or what type of
pricing the customers in the host country would accept baffl e international marketeers and research
helps in reducing these uncertainties. However, there are always constraints of time and money for
organising these researches. Hence, an &lsquo;on the spot&rsquo; enquiry is of great help if conducted by trained
researchers.
<p>The secondary data available for different countries are not compatible and its comparison can
pose problems. Consumer expenditure in Germany is taken from turnover receipts and in the US, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 93
<p>household surveys and production sources also add to the information base. International market
research has to take multiple countries into account and consider each country&rsquo;s unique market
situation. In low-profi t markets, major research could prove expensive. In many underdeveloped
countries, data availability is scarce and not reliable.
<p>Companies fi nd that comparing data is fraught with problems because of the different ways the
data has been collected, the time it was collected and the problems that arise out of the distortions
in currency conversion rates over a period of time. There could be a major difference in the purpose
for which the data was collected and the expected accuracy levels. The data must be analysed for its
timeliness, accuracy, completeness and the methodology used for collecting the same.
<p>For international market research, the following questions need to be asked:
<p>1. Ask yourself, what information do I need?
2. Where can I get it&mdash;fi les, library or database?
3. Why do I need the information?
4. When do I need it?
5. What is the money value of the information to me?
6. What would be the cost of ignorance?
<p>Some countries have specialised research agencies like ORG Marg in India that collects specifi ed
data and information that they sell to buyers interested in the data. This data could be about specifi c
markets, regions, products or about several of these items. Studies that provide information about
imports and exports from countries are usually available from the governments of those countries.
Trade organisations like the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), The
Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) and the Confederation
of Indian Industries (CII) in India and such others worldwide publish a lot of data relevant to
their country&rsquo;s commerce and trade, both internal and international. Government agencies like the
Directorate of Advertising &amp; Visual Publicity (DAVP) in India bring out yearly almanacs and other
literature with data and facts about the country&rsquo;s commerce. Export promotion boards are other sources
of information needed by international marketeers. International organisations like the WTO, IMF
and the World Bank have large research units in each country that gather trade-related information.
Several countries have active governmental support for international marketers and their government
arranges for the required data to be made available to international marketers.
<p>The latest and the most important of data bases are now available at the click of the mouse through
the internet. Information on the internet is usually available on a real-time basis as it is updated online.
Google and other websites offer a huge amount of information online.
<p>Multinational corporations also arrange market research in the different countries where they
intend to explore the market. The travelling executives of these companies are supposed to be the eyes
and ears of the company. They watch the markets, collect information that is then analysed, classifi ed and
stored in the databank for use. Field research conducted in the international market needs a thorough
knowledge of the country, its culture, economic standards for the research to be of real value. For
example, competition in shoes in some countries could come from the local town cobblers rather than
from any known brand. In Kolkata, for example, there are a number of excellent Chinese cobblers
who operate from small shops. They compete with the big brands and they are successful due to their
special talent in craftsmanship and in designing shoes for the wearer&rsquo;s comfort.
<p>The databases of the MNCs cover a wide variety of subjects, different markets, products and know-
ledge of competition that becomes useful once the company decides to enter a particular country&rsquo;s
market for its products.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management94
<p>Once the company has acquired the relevant market information it has to understand the oppor-
tunities and risks involved in doing business in that country. A low-risk country with high opportunities
should be the target in the fi rst instance. As the company gathers experience in the fi eld of international
marketing, it can plan entry into medium-risk countries that offer the next best opportunities.
<p> Companies need to start with secondary research by using libraries, online databases, trade associ-
ations and government publications. They need to gather information from foreign embassies about
their countries of interest. They need to cross-check every piece of information from several sources.
<p>Survey research is conducted by using a questionnaire and putting questions to potential customers.
The questionnaires should be simple, easy to be answered and recorded. The questions should be
clear and to the point.
<p>A company planning to get into the international market needs to analyse the countries it wants
to select after research and then place these countries in a matrix as shown in Table 3.2.
<p>Table 3.2 Rating Countries for Business Potential

<p>Note: The countries should be rated on a scale of 1&ndash;5.
<p>The matrix would bring out the best option(s) the company has for entering international markets.
Next, the company can build a matrix describing the country&rsquo;s attractiveness as a market and its
<p>competitive strengths as shown in Table 3.3.

<p>International Organisations 95
<p>Companies have to plan their initial operations in countries appearing in the top left corner of the
matrix. Once a company has established itself in one country, it has to select from the following two
options to increase its business:
<p>1. Consolidate its market in the host country with intensive marketing plans.
2. Diversify in other countries that have similar markets and business environments.
<p>When a company plans international marketing and it has no experience, it would not be able to
fi nd the most appropriate strategies for gaining market share there. It would perhaps react to the op-
portunities available and in this way may gain competitive advantage. However, with experience the
company would proactively plan on countries which would give it the best results. In the beginning
the companies appoint local channels to market their products. As the sales grow they increase their
investments in marketing with heavy inputs in advertising, promotion and sales training.
<p>It must be understood that rarely do companies have enough resources to take steps regarding
all the opportunities that come their way. The major considerations they have are regarding the size of
the market, its growth potential and competitive strengths. The geographic location of the markets and
their distance from the manufacturing base are important considerations in the selection of countries.
Companies need to scan the markets carefully so that they do not miss out on good prospective areas.
Scanning can help in ranking and prioritising the countries on the basis of their relative importance
for the company.
<p>Companies must accept and try to exploit their specifi c core competencies and competitive strengths
that are relevant to their geographic expansion. However, the more important areas to be looked into
are the following:
<p>1. Relative market potential in different countries under purview.
2. Availability and cost of human resources, information and fi nancial resources in the countries.
3. Relative risk factors attached with the countries.
4. The accuracy of the data available on the countries and how recent the information is. Companies
<p>must understand the different terminologies used in different countries, their data collection
methods and base years of the data.
<p>5. The data is usually available from international consultancy fi rms, government publications
and their cost and usefulness vary for each country.
<p>6. Companies can use the diversifi cation method of spreading into several countries with a low-
level of commitment or they can go to only one country and do intensive marketing there.
The decision to concentrate or diversify would depend on the growth rate, sales stability in the
countries, competitive strengths, product needs and the acceptance levels of the products in
the markets.
<p>7. In most countries, companies need to develop local talents, marketing plans and policies,
distribution and communication strategies.
<p>Market research should give the following information:
<p>1. Demand analysis is dependent on a country&rsquo;s gross national product and per capita income.
The demands of low-income countries are more on core products like food and clothing. In
high-income countries, the demand is for heavy industries.
<p>2. Income elasticity of demand can be found out both for consumer and industrial products. Basic
necessities do not have much of income elasticity, while the demand for luxuries changes with
change in income.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management96
<p>The entry barriers to countries are listed next and these determine whether or not a market is
conducive for entry:
<p>1. Government regulations regarding foreign fi rms.
2. Low infrastructure like telephones, power, roads, railways and ports.
3. Poor availability of raw materials.
4. High cost of money, high borrowing rates.
5. High rate of import duties.
<p>Products for the International Market
It cannot be assumed that a product that has done well in the home market will also do well in the
international market. According to Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs, products are meant to satisfy human
needs like those of safety, social acceptance, esteem and self-actualisation and psychological needs.
A car is not just a car. Besides being a means of transportation, it is also a refl ection of a person&rsquo;s
lifestyle.
<p>Local products are meant just for one country. There may be a big demand for them in the home
country. The American telecom giant, AT&amp;T, confi ned its business to the US market till the last
quarter of the twentieth century, as the market was large enough for its products. Sometimes product
specifi cations differ. For example, the voltage requirements for electrical goods may differ across
countries.
<p>The following are the reasons for going overseas:
<p>1. Firms can utilise their local expertise in the global context and thus improve on it.
2. Firms can use their experience of one market to further their efforts in other markets.
3. They can make better use of managerial expertise.
<p>International Products
International products have the potential of being sold in a number of markets. Industrial products are
less dependent on the environment and can be exported with greater ease than consumer products.
For consumer products, product modifi cations may be needed and these modifi cations need to be cost
effective. For example, large milk bottles were not successful in Japan where in small homes people
have small refrigerators, which could not accommodate the large bottles.
<p>Global products are made with the global market in mind. The Mercedes car is the same everywhere.
Sony&rsquo;s Walkman is another example. The high cost of product development needs to be amortised
over as large a volume as the global market can provide.
<p>Global Products
<p>While global products are marketed the same way around the world, some of the Ps like promotion or
placement may need to be changed. Advertising campaigns must be translated in the local language </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Organisations 97
<p>and at times, this is diffi cult as the subtle nuances of any language are not easily translatable. The
global product/brand must be guided by the same strategic plans and principles. Coke and Pepsi
are two examples of global brands. Even then, their tastes differ across regions. For example, sweeter
colas are preferred in the east while this is not so in the west. Thus, the products are differentiated
accordingly.
<p>The following are the pricing considerations for export markets:
<p> 1. Price-quality parity.
2. Price competitiveness.
3. Penetrating or skimming pricing or any other consideration.
4. Trade discounts, cash discounts and volume discounts that need to be offered in any overseas
<p>market.
5. Whether segment price differential is required or not.
6. Price elasticity of demand in the overseas market.
7. Overseas governments&rsquo; pricing regulations if any.
8. Any anti-dumping laws.
9. International transportation costs.
10. International currency fl uctuations.
11. Government tax laws.
<p>International pricing strategy takes costs and competitive pricing into account. In case the de-
mand of the product is not price elastic, it may be worthwhile to keep high prices. The total of fi xed
and variable costs tend to go up with the addition of the product adoption costs. Marketing costs
could well be much higher as compared to domestic marketing costs. It is best to select a price with
highest margins after taking the expenses on channel members and marketing into account.
<p>Introductory pricing is done on cost-plus basis or by taking only variable cost into consideration
with only an element of fi xed cost. However, if the market is in the growth stage of PLC, a higher
price can be fi xed. The IMF was created under the auspices of the UNO. It is a body that regulates
smooth to compensate for balance of payment defi cits. SDRs are assets allotted by the IMF on the
basis of country&rsquo;s GDP and share of world trade.
<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING MANAGERS
<p>Marketing managers have to perform very similar functions in home and host countries, except that
in the host country, the business environment differs to a large extent and the managers must be
vigilant in coping with the changing business scenario in an alien land.
<p>Managers have to learn about the host country&rsquo;s consumers&rsquo; tastes, buying patterns, income diver-
sity and demand patterns, which could be fast changing due to technology changes and changes in
income levels. Therefore, historical data could be misleading.
<p>Managers have to ensure that a product fi ts with the consumers, which could entail product or
package modifi cations. (Japanese homes have small refrigerators in which the standard 200 ml Coke
bottle does not fi t.) Managers have to relate to the stage of product life cycle and direct the fi rm&rsquo;s
resources for the right products. This is important as a product could be in a maturity stage in one
country and be in a growth stage in another.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management98
<p>Advertising, publicity, promotion plans all must be country specifi c, unless a product like the
Mercedes car is being sold, which is a world accepted product and can sell on global advertising
plans.
<p>International Marketing Game 3.1
<p>The teams should scan the competitive business environment for the chosen product in the selected
country using Porter&rsquo;s Five Force Model. Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five Force Model is very useful in
understanding the competitive environment. In the good old days, competition meant only the
players in the fi eld. The Five Force Model makes a comprehensive statement on what constitutes
competition (see Figure 3.2).
<p>Figure 3.2 Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five Force Model
<p>Threat of new entrants
<p>Bargaining power of suppliers Rivalry among existing players Bargaining power of buyers
<p>Threat of substitute products
<p>New Entrants
New Entrants pose a disguised threat as their entry time and manner is not known till the very
last moment. Each business area has some entry barriers and exit barriers. If the entry barrier is
high and the exit barrier low then it is the best place to be in because new fi rms will not enter and
low-performing fi rms will quit instead of trying to undersell and make everyone lose profi ts. The
following are entry barriers:
<p>1. Government regulations like licenses
2. High project costs
3. Diffi culty in obtaining technology
4. Market in maturity or decline stage
5. Paucity of raw materials
6. Non-availability of channel members
<p>More players in the fi eld mean excess production capacity and lower profi t margins for the
players.

<p>They need to be watched carefully as with innovation and new technology, they can pose a major
threat. Home interior walls can be covered with lime wash (chuna), emulsion paints, wallpaper or
wood panels. Each has its own pricing formula, plus and minus points.
<p>Suppliers
<p>Suppliers to the fi rm play a key role in product costs. If the buyers are few and suppliers several,
then buyers will enjoy the power to bargain. In case there are only a handful of suppliers and
several buyers, suppliers hold the advantage.
<p>Buyers
<p>Buyers of the fi rm are always the most important part in the game of marketing. With large number
of buyers and few suppliers, the buyers can be at the supplier&rsquo;s mercy. The teams need to analyse
competition in their chosen market. They need to assess whether they are strong, large in number
and aggressive, or the fi rm can lead the pack of competitors. How to locate the competitors is a
vital question for fi rms. Pepsi knows that Coke is its biggest competitor and yet they cannot neglect
minor competitors. In the area of television (TV) manufacturers in India, Sony, Samsung and Philips,
are known competitors and yet there are several small assemblers in each major centre and they
account for nearly 25 per cent of the total sale of TVs. The same thing is true for many industries
including the computer industry. For this purpose, fi rms should arrange regular feedback from
its marketing or fi eld sales force, so that the real picture of competition, its business terms and
prices can be known. Otherwise, the fi rm is fi ghting a battle with ghosts.

<p>4 International Trading
<p>&lsquo;The vacuum in the market is created by outside forces. It is the wise marketer who takes advantage
of the vacuum before the others join in and spoil the show&rsquo;.
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
One of the most important aspects of international marketing is international trading and successful
companies organise their international operations around their international trade. This chapter covers
the topic comprehensively and students will get a complete picture of international trade especially
from the exporter&rsquo;s perspective.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 101
<p>There are several trade theories prevalent in the international markets. These have evolved
since the eighteenth century. The international market demand for products and product life
cycle differ from country to country because of their economic standards, their psychographic
<p>attitudes and, in some cases, their climatic conditions.
Companies need to have a strong brand image of their product before it starts selling in the host
<p>country. Image building should start as discussed next:
<p> 1. Image of the country as a supplier of good useful products.
2. Image of the company trying international marketing as a supplier of good &lsquo;value for money
<p>products&rsquo;.
3. Brand image of the product.
4. Companies need to work on these issues in close coordination with the government, other
<p>companies and trading organisations.
5. Companies need to learn how trade theories affect international marketing.
6. Countries should get over the belief prevalent from the sixteenth to eighteenth century that
<p>only a country&rsquo;s government can become an exporter and not individual companies.
7. Companies have to realise that today it is the economies of scale and experience curve with
<p>newer technologies bringing in the cost leadership, besides product differentiation that gives
them a competitive advantage. Companies need to have their hand on the market pulse to be
able to supply the product immediately even when the need is only dormant.
<p> 8. The theory of comparative advantage, rather than absolute advantage, works for companies
if they can accurately determine the levels of such advantage.
<p> 9. Companies have to realise the importance and effect of tariff and non-tariff barriers in different
countries and should take advantage of these barriers.
<p>10. Companies have to understand the &lsquo;balance of payment&rsquo; and &lsquo;balance of trade&rsquo; between
countries for getting the best out of these situations.
<p>11. Several countries, including India, give different incentives for international marketers
maintaining a certain level of current account, capital account and reserves.
<p>12. Companies must understand commodity, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
13. The employment factor in the host country, revenue and transfer of dividends in foreign
<p>currency along with fluctuations in consumption usually govern the host country&rsquo;s
government&rsquo;s policies on international trade.
<p>14. Companies need to learn about import quota restrictions especially in the garment trade.
<p>RECENT TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS IN WORLD TRADE
<p>The world economy expanded by 3.3 per cent in 2005, less rapidly than in 2004, but still slightly
faster than the decade&rsquo;s average. Economic growth remained strong in most regions although less
buoyant than in the preceding year. Only Europe&rsquo;s economy continued to record low gross domestic
product (GDP) growth&mdash;less than half the rate observed in North America. In contrast to Europe, Japan
experienced a strengthening of economic activity. In light of slower economic growth worldwide in
2005 and of oil market developments, merchandise trade growth&mdash;like GDP growth&mdash;decelerated
in real terms, but still exceeded the average for the last decade.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management102
<p>For Indian business, international business has become an imperative because of the sudden infl ux
of international competition with the entry of several multinational corporations (MNCs). This has
further strengthened due to convertibility of Rupee on trade account. International trade between two
countries is dependent on the balance of payment situation between countries. The balance occurs
due to the following reasons:
<p>1. On current account because of merchandise exports, service trade, gifts on a personal level and
government aid transactions between two countries.
<p>2. On capital account due to direct investments in equity of fi rms in another country at more than
20 per cent of the total equity, portfolio investment in fi rms&rsquo; equity with less than 20 per cent
shares and other long- and short-term capital fl ow.
<p>The trade deceleration was most pronounced in the developed, oil-importing regions in this decade.
Most of the developing regions and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) recorded real
import growth rates above the global average and in excess of their export growth. Oil price increases
are a signifi cant part of the explanation for this performance in many of the concerned countries.
A sharp increase in crude oil prices pushed up energy costs worldwide but did not trigger a marked
rise in consumer prices. Several factors contributed to this outcome:
<p>1. First, many developed countries today have a lower oil intensity of output than three decades
ago as the service sector accounts for a larger part of the GDP.
<p>2. Second, the slack in production capacity combined with moderate wage increases in many
developed regions lowered the possibility of passing on higher energy costs to consumers.
<p>3. Core consumer price infl ation, that is, all items excluding energy and food decreased in the
Euro Area and the United States and stagnated in Japan in 2005.
<p>Despite an acceleration in global economic activity and trade, the annual average change in world
output and trade were lower than in the preceding year although they were higher that the decade&rsquo;s
average. The world economic output of goods and services is estimated to have expanded by 3.3 per cent
and real merchandise exports rose by 6 per cent in 2005 (see Table 4.1). The year-to-year deceleration
of global economic output and trade was rather close to the predictions made in early 2005.

<p>A regional breakdown of the world economy reveals that the sluggishness of the European economy
constituted a major drag on world trade and output growth as Europe continued to report the weakest
trade and output expansion of all regions. The four largest economies in Europe (Germany, France,
United Kingdom and Italy) all recorded GDP growth below 2 per cent, while the new members of the
European Union (EU) continued to grow faster than the old members, with a combined GDP growth </p>

<p>up by 4 per cent in 2005. North America&rsquo;s GDP growth of 3.4 per cent continued to slightly exceed
global economic growth. Within the region, US economy recorded the strongest growth.
<p>On the other hand, economic growth in the developing regions remained robust in 2005, though
somewhat less dynamic than in the preceding year. In South and Central America (including the
Caribbean), Africa and the Middle East, GDP growth averaged between 4 and 5 per cent. Developing
Asia did not escape the global trend to more moderate growth in 2005. However, with regional GDP
growth up by 6.5 per cent, Asia again recorded the highest growth of all developing regions. China
and India, the two countries with the largest populations in the world, again reported outstandingly
high GDP growth in 2005&mdash;at 9.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent respectively. The strongest economic growth
of all regions in 2005 was reported by the CIS countries.
<p>Developments in the world energy markets not only impacted regional economic growth, but also
shaped global trade fl ows. The most visible sign of change in the global energy markets is the substantial
rise in fuel prices and, in particular, the price of crude oil since 2003. These price developments are
caused by major shifts in global oil demand. Robust economic growth in the US and vigorous energy-
intensive growth in major emerging economies (especially China) were key factors. Strong oil demand
in the US economy led to a sharp rise in its oil imports as domestic crude oil production continued to
shrink. The strength of oil demand in many emerging markets was underpinned by the high energy
intensity of this growth. Recently, oil demand has been artifi cially sustained in some of these markets as
end user prices were not fully adjusted to refl ect the rise of energy prices in international markets.
<p>High global oil demand growth quickly absorbed the existing excess oil extraction capacity,
located mainly in the Middle East. The low short-term price elasticity of oil supplies is due to the fact
that additions of new capacity require an increase in drilling activities and investments in oilfi eld
developments which need a lead time of several years before production capacity goes up.
<p>Figure 4.1 shows that the price of fuel and other mining products in each of the three economies
rose by more than one-third, while the import prices of agricultural and manufactured goods nearly
stagnated or increased moderately in 2005. The negative impact of the oil price hike on world economic
growth has so far been less far-reaching than observed in the past.

<p>RECENT TRADE DEVELOPMENTS&mdash;REGION-WISE
DEVELOPMENTS
<p>All regions participated in the deceleration of world merchandise trade, as each major region
expanded its real merchandise imports in 2005 less rapidly than in 2004. The expansion of imports
of the oil-importing developed countries&mdash;Japan, the EU and the US in 2005 was less than half the
rate recorded in 2004. While US imports rose less than world trade they still expanded twice as fast
as those of the EU. Linked to its sluggish economic performance, Europe&rsquo;s trade growth was sharply
reduced in 2005 (see Table 4.2).

North America&rsquo;s real merchandise exports and imports expanded by about 6 per cent, the same
<p>rate as world trade in 2005. Oil-exporting Canada and Mexico increased their real imports faster
than their exports, while the opposite development could be observed for the US. South and Central
America&rsquo;s merchandise exports and imports continued to be among the most dynamic trade fl ows in
2005. Strong global demand and high prices for its major export commodities, combined with robust
economic growth in the region, stimulated the region&rsquo;s exports and imports, which expanded at double-
digit rates. The major net-oil exporting regions&mdash;the Middle East, Africa and the CIS&mdash;all recorded a
very strong expansion of their real merchandise imports by far exceeding world trade growth.
<p>Asia&rsquo;s merchandise exports and imports expanded by 9.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively.
Asia&rsquo;s trade developments are prominently shaped by China&rsquo;s performance. In 2005, China&rsquo;s exports
expanded by one-quarter in real terms and thereby more than two times faster than Asia&rsquo;s total exports
or its own import growth.
<p>International trade theory confi rms the competitiveness of manufacture in a given location. It
identifi es the place where the manufacturing would be most effi cient and it also explains if the local
governments would allow free fl ow of trade between countries.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 105
<p>International trade was in operation long before any trade theories were evolved. These theories are
helpful today to MNCs in planning their operations. On the basis of trade theories, fi rms can expect
that the greater the dissimilarity between nations, the greater is the trade potential between them.
However, most trade occurs among nations having similar status. It is, however, believed that free
trade results in the most effi cient utilisation of the resources of the world. While trade theories talk
about cross country benefi ts and cost, trading decisions are taken at the fi rm level only.
<p>Governments usually want to infl uence trade for economic, social or political objectives. A variety
of measures are tried by them to balance confl icting objectives and appease various interest groups.
In India, for instance, the government has been walking a tightrope as it wants to invite foreign direct
investments (FDIs) where foreign companies can have majority share holdings even up to 100 per cent
while the labour unions are against the proliferation of foreigners in the Indian business world.
<p>Political concerns rather than economic factors are the main reason for governmental interference
in international trade. Political problems have led to serious confl icts within and among nations.
This manifests itself in several ways including the fear of loss of jobs for local residents. However,
companies do not fi nd any barriers holding back their international forays. In fact, most governments
assiduously make efforts to assist such companies in their overseas ventures.
<p>To augment their efforts of going international, countries can use the United Nations (UN) bodies
like the World Trade Organization (WTO) and regional economic groups to reduce trade barriers on a
multilateral basis and they can agree on a simplifi ed mechanism for the conduct of international trade.
Trade liberalisation on a global basis is diffi cult due to fundamental differences between nations.
<p>As stated earlier, one of the most important reasons for governmental interference in international
trade is to secure and expand employment opportunities for its population. With this theory, there
can be the possibility of retaliation and the fact that both import and exports create job, it is diffi cult
to determine the effect on employment of a government policy protecting an industry.
<p>Trading worldwide is possible in those countries that subscribe to free trade, at least to some
extent. Most countries, however, have been giving lip service to free trade. The reasons for this non-
subscribing to free trade are:
<p>1. To give a boost to local business and protect it from international competition.
2. When a country can not provide the necessary infrastructure required by international
<p>traders.
3. When a country&rsquo;s political agenda does not match with free trade.
4. When the economic level of a country is low and the consumers are not able to afford anything
<p>beyond food and other items of dire necessity.
<p>It is for these reasons that a number of trading models have emerged and fi rms select one or more
of these models while going overseas:
<p>1. A single low-cost product to be sold universally or a number of products with different values
to suit each country.
<p>2. Special research and development efforts to keep adding innovative features to products or
waiting for the competition to bring about a new innovative product and then with the help of
reverse engineering bringing out a better alternative product (a &lsquo;me too&rsquo; product, but better).
<p>3. Companies have the choice of keeping to home country production for gaining economies of
scale because of additional export trade or to outsource production to countries where there is
a production cost advantage, due to either lower labour costs or availability of raw materials
at lower costs.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management106
<p>4. Integrating the host country&rsquo;s business methods, ethics or maintaining the home country&rsquo;s
standards. For example, if it is the norm in the host country to sell products on bargain counters,
the fi rm has to decide to stick to their own distribution channels or vend through the bargain
counters.
<p>5. Companies have the choice of dovetailing their product to meet local needs or letting the product
stay as it is. Doughnuts are eaten for breakfast in the West, while in Japan they are eaten as
snacks. The company Donut, therefore, started a chain of doughnut restaurants near railway
stations and shopping malls in Japan.
<p>6. Outsourcing manufacturing operations to low-cost labour countries can be counterproductive
for two reasons, one, the worker productivity may be much lower, increasing the overall labour
cost and two, the product quality may suffer because of the country&rsquo;s lower benchmarks.
<p>Trade theory confi rms the position of countries best suited for manufacturing and those ideal for
marketing products. The theory of comparative advantage of nations explains the supply and demand
management proportions and any shift in the same can cause a paradigm shift in trade and its spread.
Comparative advantage accrues to countries because of the following reasons:
<p>1. Availability of advance technology.
2. Availability of low-cost and yet skilled labour.
3. Availability of raw materials.
4. Proximity of markets.
5. Availability of low-cost fi nance.
6. Having a good infrastructure base.
<p>Governments of nations play a major role in trade, at times to impede its progress mainly to protect
national interests. Even large economies and countries with fi nancial muscle try to stop the free fl ow
of trade between nations. The US has protectionist laws that safeguard its country&rsquo;s interest such as
anti-dumping laws, fi bre agreements that provide for a quota system for the entry of textiles from
different countries into the US. The fi bre agreement apparently is on its way out due to pressures
from the WTO.
<p>Countries seek a favourable balance of payment situation in order to gain infl ux of gold as per the
mercantilist theory. The neo-mercantilist plan is meant to address some social or political issues.
<p>In the seventeenth century, Adam Smith introduced the theory of absolute advantage. According
to Smith, these advantages could accrue to nations because of their natural climate, availability of
raw materials, technology with patents. India, for instance, enjoys an advantage because of the avail-
ability of raw materials, trained manpower and variegated climate conditions from where the
manufacturer can choose the best required for the company. Proximity to international markets adds
another advantage as it saves on transportation costs and time. In other words, countries that do not
have absolute advantage can still get into international markets with comparative advantage coming
from these factors and from special skills needed for the manufacture of certain products.
<p>The export and import trade of countries is governed by the trade policy its government formulates
to regulate trade. These trade policies are meant to assist the trade by fi rms in the following manner:
<p>1. In deciding with which countries they should have export&ndash;import ties.
2. What product(s) they should be importing and exporting to which country.
3. Whether these products should be fully manufactured in the home country or partly there and
<p>the rest in the host country.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 107
<p>4. Should the manufacturing process be outsourced to a third country or not.
5. If the manufacturing process is not to be carried out in the home country, what quality control
<p>measures are required to be taken to ensure that quality standards are maintained.
<p>International trade faces barriers placed by governments of different countries, unless there is no
governmental interference (in international trade). Trade pacts between nations, both bilateral and
multilateral have become the norm today, which govern international trade to a large extent.
<p>If, however, there were no such barriers, trade would follow the natural route of comparative
advantage between nations; a country having core competency in one area over another country
would be able to export its products to that country.
<p>Trade between nations has been there from the last several centuries&mdash;from 1500 ad, when the
nations were getting formed out of the city-states and tribes as gold had become the standard of
product-trade exchange. The nations with gold reserve were considered rich and the balance of
trade was equated by giving away of gold by the low-exporting/high-importing nations to the high-
exporting/low-importing nations as gold had become the standard of product-trade exchange.
<p>Today, the balance of trade means that if a country is exporting more than it is importing, the
balance is in its favour, otherwise it is not. In reality, the surplus nation is providing credit to the defi cit
nation and if this credit cannot buy goods required by the surplus nation from the defi cit nation, it
can be harming the surplus nation.
<p>Nations no longer work on the theory of absolute advantage of nations. The theory says that a
country that can produce a good at a lower cost than all others, can sell to the other nations.
<p>The lower cost of manufacture comes from the following factors:
<p>1. Economies of scale of manufacture where the fi xed cost of manufacture remains constant while
the total production increases. For example, if a fi rm is making 1,000 cars per day and its daily
fi xed cost is Rs 100,000, then the fi xed cost per unit comes to Rs 100. When the fi rm increases
its production to 1,200 cars per day, its fi xed cost per unit comes down to Rs 83.33 (this is based
on the premise that no new supervisor has been hired or the fi xed cost has not gone up in any
other manner).
<p>2. The fi rm uses robotics or other labour-saving devices in its manufacturing process, which cut
down on production time and cost with new technology.
<p>3. Experience curve helps in reducing per unit variable cost. This reduction comes from the
workers who gain experience working on the same equipment over the years and this reduces
the rejection rate as well as the manufacturing time.
<p>Firms and countries can achieve comparative advantage over each other. One country could be
more effi cient in automobile technology while the other could be an expert in computers. In such a
case, instead of developing the skills not available with them, they could exchange products.
<p>Some countries enjoy a natural advantage over others because of the following reasons:
<p>1. Availability of natural resources like water.
2. Raw materials.
3. Climatic conditions conducive to the manufacture of some products.
4. Trained and skilled manpower.
<p>Summarising, the trade theory explains what can be produced competitively in a given location,
where a fi rm may go to produce a given product effi ciently and whether government policies may </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management108
<p>interfere with the free fl ow of trade between countries. The following are the eight theories of inter-
national trade:
<p>1. Mercantilism
2. Absolute advantage
3. Natural advantage
4. Acquired advantage
5. Country size
6. Comparative advantage
7. Factor proportions
8. Product life cycle
<p>Adam Smith&rsquo;s theory of a country&rsquo;s absolute advantage holds good even today except that in real
terms it is the theory of comparative advantage that is operative today. Companies look for places
most suitable for manufacturing and distribution to their selected markets. Countries have relative
advantage in labour, land costs, capital costs and availability and these factors are responsible in
products suited to these areas being made in these countries. In the introductory stages of a product
life cycle, products are made in the country where they have been developed. In the next stages of the
product life cycle, the manufacturing moves out to other nations. Trade develops between industrial-
ised nations as they form similar market segments with similar usage patterns of the products.
Developing nations try to export their goods, which could result in the home country starving of
the products. Trade decisions are made at the company level but they are always infl uenced by the
government&rsquo;s policies on trade and commerce. However, companies plan international trade be-
cause they want to use the excess production capacity, low cost of manufacture or they want to spread
the manufacturing costs on large volume sales based both on local and international sales.
<p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
<p>Government of countries have a responsibility towards the stakeholders involved in trade and
commerce. Therefore, no country allows the free fl ow of imports and exports even though these provide
resources to the country. Countries believe that trade and commerce within the country provide em-
ployment to the local population. However, as both imports and exports generate employment
opportunities restrictions for international players coming to do business in the country could become
counterproductive to the interests of the country. With several countries opting for the market economy,
the trade policies of these countries have changed. However, they are yet to redistribute the income
coming from the trade.
<p>Some countries believe that protection to local small industry is required, otherwise these will be
wiped out. India too, had a protectionist policy towards local industry to a large extent. However, in
such countries, the consumers are the main sufferers as they have to accept the product with whatever
quality standards it is sold as the choices are limited to them. The reason for the protectionist policy
adopted by governments is that local businesses have to compete with companies from the developed
world. Moreover, governments attempt to solve the problems faced by them on account of &lsquo;balance
of payment&rsquo;, currency fl uctuations and adjustments in international prices. Trade controls help to
regulate prices in international markets and in monopoly situations and help local players secure
greater profi ts.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 109
<p>International trade is to an extent regulated by local governments because of political motivation
rather than economic considerations. Governments like to keep the supply of essential goods and de-
fence equipment within the country as international traders could stifl e their supplies during exigent
situations because of the infl uence of power block countries. Tariffs, subsidies, custom duties and
specifi c non-tariff barriers are used by countries for this purpose. At times, countries force buyers to
buy only locally made products through legislative regulations. Countries can place barriers by asking
for near impossible product specifi cations or quality acceptance levels. Some European buyers want
to know the actual acreage of the crop to be imported from India. Countries can force exporters to
buy in exchange, products from them that are not required by the exporting country. Governments
try to identify ways of ensuring that international traders coming to their country do minimum
harm, if at all to the local business.
<p>STRATEGIES FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY IN INDIA
<p>As has been well established so far, no country can remain an island; it cannot survive in an isolated
market. The dream of Mahatma Gandhi of a world without boundaries is becoming a reality. Let us
go back to the beginning of trade in the world. Even in ancient times, condiments from India and the
east, silk from China, horses from the Arab nations were bought and sold far and wide. In prehistoric
times, there were no countries, no boundaries, people lived the life of nomads in clans and roamed
about in search of food and water. The fi rst civilisations settled close to rivers, which gave them access
to water. These people hunted for wild game in the nearby jungles. Their needs were few and yet the
fi rst commerce must have started when one clan had meat and the other tatters for making dresses.
Refusal to exchange goods led to fi ghts. This resulted in the death of the menfolk and a change in the
ratio of men and women giving rise to polygamy in the Middle East. It was the beginning of an era of
women traders, who were hard bargainers but not fi ghters like their menfolk. Women bartered their
wares to get what they wanted from other women in their own clan and later on from the nomadic
clans that they came in contact with.
<p>When more than two persons got involved in a deal, the situation got a little complex. If A had one
item that C wanted, while C had something that B could sell to A to satisfy his demand, they needed
a system of exchange other than the barter system. The fi rst monetary system evolved to meet this
demand. Prehistoric coins found in excavations confi rm the usage of coins during that period.
<p>The Industrial Revolution started in the UK and Europe in the seventeenth century. Steam engines,
internal combustion engines, telephones and electricity were developed and put in the market.
This led to greater speed in travel, communication and revolutionised the manufacturing process.
Unfortunately, India missed the bus because it was under British rule. The British were keen on sub-
jugating Indians by ensuring that their education levels were such that they could produce a race of
clerks only.
<p>The twentieth century brought independence to India and several other countries and while India
could walk tall in the comity of nations it stayed a backward underdeveloped nation.
<p>It also brought about rapid changes in the way people live, work and do business. The twentieth
century was witness to the World Wars, the Holocaust and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
On the fl ip side, the twentieth century also saw the invention of motorcars, with Henry Ford&rsquo;s
assembly-line operations, which revolutionised the entire manufacturing industry. Another revolution,
though bigger in dimension was Albert Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity, which led to splitting of the </p>

<p>atom and the the invention of the atom bomb. Today, however, the atomic energy is being harnessed
for peaceful purposes as well.
<p>Coming full circle, the world is again becoming boundary-less as evident from the reduction in
trade barriers, third-country manufacturing, free trade zones and UN agencies trying to organise a free
market world where movement of goods for trade would be freely allowed across the world. Travel
is so much faster with supersonic planes; communication is quick and effi cient in most parts of the
world. Comfort-giving, time-saving gadgets have made life easy and interesting. On the fl ip side of
the coin, terrorism, sometimes state sponsored, is making life quite miserable for a lot of people.
<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING TODAY
<p>The world of commerce has undergone a sea change in the following manner:
<p>1. Fast changing technologies.
2. Shortening of product life cycles.
3. New channels of distribution.
4. New avenues for advertising and promotion.
<p>In the Indian business, people buy and sell, make and sell, or make to give to others for sale. Exports
have become a priority since 1991, when the Government of India decided to open its markets to world
players without any reservations. Imports were liberalised and partial convertibility of Rupee helped
businesses import goods, especially for export-based manufacture. Indian business could cash in on
its advantages like its low-cost labour force, high-tech workforce, expertise in export of computer
software, availability of raw materials, a huge domestic market for testing the products and a large
English-speaking population.
<p>Internationally, before 1991, the developed nations and their MNCs were doling out old tech-
nologies at high prices to Indian businessmen in the belief that they did not know about further
advances in technology, which they wanted to keep for their own countries. After all, the poor
Indians would not know the difference, and old itself is new and good for them. Even the capital
(manufacturing equipment) equipments sold to India were often used ones.
<p>Export imperatives for India come from the following reasons:
<p>1. More effi cient production.
2. Better quality norms.
3. Lower operating costs.
4. Availability of raw materials in the international market at competitive prices.
<p>Indian business investments in other countries should be based on the estimated inward cash
fl ow through profi ts/dividends accrued from the business. Countries have different economic status,
demand patterns and thorough market surveys are the key to success in international markets.
<p>Indian fi rms can organise fi nances for export trade from the following sources:
<p>1. Banks.
2. Trade bills by discounting them for short-term fi nance.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 111
<p>3. Global depository receipts, American depository receipts.
4. Foreign banks.
5. Multi-currency bonds.
6. Foreign equity through NASDAQ, Dow Jones.
<p>INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRANSACTIONS
International trade is conducted with the help of the following documents:
<p>1. Trade draft, bill of exchange, sight draft and time draft.
2. Letter of credit.
3. Bill of lading/airway bill.
<p>The bill of lading and its counterpart for dispatches by air, the airway bill, represent the following
transaction between the seller and the buyer:
<p>1. It is a receipt of goods by the carriers from the exporter.
2. It is a contract between exporter and the transporters for transfer of goods to a destination for
<p>a third party, the buyer.
3. It is a document for title of goods for importer, which he gets after completing certain formalities
<p>like obtaining it (the bill of lading along with other documents) from a bank after making the
desired payment through a letter of credit.
<p>4. The bill of lading is a legal document accepted by international law.
<p>International transactions take place as discussed next:
<p>1. An enquiry for the product required by the importer is generated by him and sent to the
exporter.
<p>2. The exporter responds by sending his quotation to the importer and on his acceptance of the
same, the quotation letter becomes a sales contract.
<p>3. Usually, under the terms of contract, the importer opens a letter of credit (LC) for the value of
the order in the exporter&rsquo;s bank through his own bank.
<p>4. On receipt of the LC, the exporter hands over the goods to the transport carrier like a ship or
aircraft against a bill of lading or an airway bill.
<p>5. The exporter then hands over the following documents to his bank for presenting to the
importer&rsquo;s bank:
<p> Invoice
Packing list
Bill of lading
Country of origin certifi cate (required by some countries only)
India&rsquo;s export certifi cate
<p>Besides, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs the following documents:
<p>1. The GR 1 form, now replaced by the custom house computer-generated exchange control copy
on the basis of the invoice (earlier it was sent to the RBI but not anymore).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management112
<p>2. The SDF form in which the exporter gives his declaration under the Foreign Exchange Regulation
Act, 1973, regarding the details of his bank through which the exporter is arranging the
transaction. This enables the RBI to keep a track of the foreign exchange payment due on
the invoice and to see that the foreign exchange is received in India on time.
<p>3. On receipt of payment the entire set of documents are sent to the RBI and only then is the case
considered closed.
<p>The system and the forms stated here are subject to change and students are encouraged to fi nd
out about the latest systems and forms.
<p>The LC is a document generated by the importer&rsquo;s bank on instructions from the importer in
favour of the exporter and is negotiated through the exporter&rsquo;s bank. It is the most widely used fi scal
document in export trade and it can be made in several ways, as discussed next:
<p>1. The importer&rsquo;s bank opens the LC on receiving instructions from the importers.
2. In essence, the importer gets time to pay, that is, he gets credit.
3. The bank agrees to honour a draft drawn on the importer by the exporter&rsquo;s bank, provided the
<p>bill of lading and other documents are received as proof that the exporter has actually exported
the goods and that they can be obtained by the importer on production of the documents.
<p>4. The LC is issued on the basis of the creditworthiness of the importer.
5. For the exporter, the LC removes the risk involved in exporting to a new country or a new
<p>buyer.
<p>The following types of LCs may be issued:
<p>1. Confi rmed LC, accepted by the exporter&rsquo;s bank.
2. Letter of credit without recourse, where the importer has no power to change or withdraw it
<p>once it is issued.
3. Letter of credit with recourse, where the importer can alter it even after it has been issued.
4. Revocable LC does not guarantee payment to the exporter and hence is not used.
5. In the case of the irrevocable LC, every person has to agree to change otherwise no change is
<p>possible and payment has to be made by the importer&rsquo;s bank to the exporter through his bank.
6. Letter of credit allowing part shipments.
7. Revolving LC, which get reinstated once they have been used and money paid through them.
<p>Besides this, Time Drafts can be used where the exporter offers credit to the importer for a fi xed
period of time as stipulated in the time draft as opposed to sight drafts where the payment has to be
made on sight (instantly).
<p>Barter System or No Cash Business
<p>When no money transaction takes place and only goods are supplied in return for goods received
from another country, then it is termed a no cash business or a barter system. Before the break up of
the USSR, India and the USSR had a business agreement whereby India got paid for exporting to the
USSR in Indian rupees. In other words, when India exported to the USSR, they had to import goods
of an equal money value from the USSR.</p>

<p>International Trading 113
<p>In the seventeenth century, Adam Smith propounded the theory of absolute advantage of nations.
Countries gained an absolute advantage when they could produce a product better and cheaper
than other countries. Smith stated that unless a country had an absolute advantage, it could not sell
its products in another country. The ability to produce goods is different in different countries due
to economies of scale, patents, raw material availability and quota systems that do not allow for the
import of products from a certain country beyond a certain point. Thus, countries have relative or
comparative advantage.
<p>CUSTOMS AND TARIFFS
<p>Custom duties and tariffs are the barriers that governments create against foreign fi rms entering their
markets as also to help the local businesses. Tariffs are of different types as discussed next:
<p>1. Single-column tariff for a product for all countries.
2. Two-column tariff, which gives one tariff rate for most countries but a different tariff rate for
<p>those countries with which an agreement exists for reduced tariff rates.
3. Preferential tariff is tariff at a reduced rate like the tariff for trade between Commonwealth
<p>countries or free trade zones.
4. Low tariff rates for underdeveloped countries assist them in entering the markets of developed
<p>countries.
<p>TYPE OF DUTIES
<p>Customs duty is charged on the following criteria:
<p>1. Ad valorem duty: This is charged as a percentage of the price. It is based on the Cost Insurance
and Freight (CIF) landed price of the product.
<p>2. Specifi c duties: These are based on the weight of the goods, their volume or number of units
exported.
<p>3. Alternate duty: In this case, both ad valorem and specifi c duties are charged.
4. Anti-dumping duty: This duty is charged on countries that dump their products at unreasonably
<p>low rates, which could harm the local industry.
5. Countervailing duty: This is charged as additional duty to offset the export incentives given to
<p>exporting fi rms by their governments.
6. Variable import duty: This is charged by Sweden and some other European countries for agro-
<p>products if the prices are lower than local prices.
7. Temporary export surcharge: This is levied mostly in the US and the UK to offset its balance
<p>of payment defi cits with other countries.
<p>With markets open for global trade, Indian fi rms fi nd that going overseas is an imperative, which
they can ill afford to ignore. Although political turmoils continue across the world, the world is </p>

<p>The certifi cate of origin is obtained from the relevant export promotion council, a list of the
existing councils is given next with addresses and other details. However, for textile exports
to countries having the quota system requires the certifi cate of origin to come in the following
manner:
<p>Procedure to be followed for submitting &lsquo;country of origin&rsquo; certifi cates while clearing
consignments in the USA on or after 1.1.2005
<p>Queries have been received by the Council regarding the procedure to be followed for submitting
&lsquo;Country of Origin&rsquo; Certifi cate while clearing consignments in the USA on or after 1.1.2005, that is,
after the removal of quotas.
<p>The matter has been clarifi ed with the Embassy of India, Washington and through them with the
US Custom Services, who have indicated as follows:
<p>1. There are two types of &lsquo;Textile declaration&rsquo; document. Single Country declaration and Multiple
Country declaration. This document can be prepared and signed by the importer, exporter or
the producer.
<p>2. Single Country declaration would be required if the raw materials and all production of the
item was done in India and may be signed as stated in (1).
<p>3. Multiple Country declaration would be required if the raw materials or processing occurred
in a country other than India and may also be signed as stated in (1).
<p>4. No Government intervention is required with a textile declaration. The document is exclusively
prepared by the parties stated as in (1).
<p>5. Normally the importers ask the exporter or producer to complete the textile declaration because
they are more familiar with the manufacturing process and it makes them less liable if the
information contained in this declaration is incorrect.
<p>The format of the Single Country declaration is at Annexure-I and Multiple Country declaration
is at Annexure-II.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Trading 119
<p>These declarations as clarifi ed above may be prepared and submitted by the manufacturer,
producer, exporter or importer of the textiles or textile products. Separate declaration may be fi led
for each invoice, which is presented at the time of entry into the USA. Entry will be denied unless it
is accompanied by a properly executed declaration as per the procedure mentioned above.
<p>All concerned may please note.

<p>5 International Competitive
Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Business with different countries depends on the in-depth knowledge a company has of the business
and the competitive environment prevailing in the host countries. This chapter provides students with
an understanding of the various factors that make up the business environment. Understanding these
factors helps companies gain a foothold in the market. With the right strategies they can not only survive
but also take the leadership position once they have gained a competitive advantage.
<p>This chapter also discusses the international buyer&rsquo;s profi le. At different times each member of
the world society is a buyer. And as buyers, people want to be known as sane, intelligent buyers. A
buyer&rsquo;s skills come from an innate selfi shness that when we are spending money we should get our
money&rsquo;s worth. The term value for money is born out of this desire. To prove the rule, there are ex-
ceptions like people buying beyond their means when they have to impress somebody, like friends or
fi anc&eacute;es. It is said that no one buys a product. They buy the benefi ts that they derive from the product.
If the benefi ts outweigh the cost the buyers have paid then they have received value for money.
Students will acquire an understanding of a customer&rsquo;s buying motivation in the international arena
through this chapter.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
<p>Multinational corporations (MNCs) operate in several countries, which have different political
systems, social milieus and levels of development. They earn profi ts in several currencies.
Some can be repatriated in the home currency while in some cases the MNCs have to
<p>spend at least part of their profi ts in the host country. International fi rms operate in one or two host
countries from the home base; they may have a sales offi ce or an agent in the host countries. Firms
with a global perspective operating in several countries with investments in marketing, production
and even research and development can be considered as true MNCs. They view the globe as their
market place and target countries one after the other on the basis of priority, which is decided on the
basis of the following factors:
<p> 1. Geographic proximity.
2. Political alignments.
3. Economic zones and economic forces.
4. Product demand (without any changes in the product specifi cations).
5. Technological advantage.
6. Price advantage due to economies of scale.
7. Firms have at least 20 per cent of their assets overseas.
8. Overseas sales and business account for about 30&ndash;40 per cent of the fi rm&rsquo;s turnover.
9. Overseas factories could be just assembly plants or full-scale manufacturing units.
10. Overseas operations may be managed by host-country personnel or even third-country
<p>managers. Initially the top management stays with the home-country personnel.
11. International business starts as an offshoot of business in the home country and then it moves
<p>across as an integrated part of the fi rm&rsquo;s operations.
12. Products like retail banking are dovetailed to meet the specifi c needs of the host country, while
<p>cars and electronic products stay the same globally.
<p>Countries like the US have been advocating free enterprise and no-barrier business across the
globe. Consolidating this thought and still focusing on national interests, several trade zones have
emerged in the world. MNCs are ready to take advantage of these zones and yet go beyond them to
individual countries where they fi nd a comparable advantage.
<p>In the seventeenth century, Adam Smith propounded the theory of absolute advantage of nations
in business. According to Smith, a country had an absolute advantage compared to other countries
when it could produce a certain product better than and at a lower cost as compared to other coun-
tries. He advised that countries should manufacture only those products where they have an absolute
advantage. Today, even if a country does not have an absolute advantage, it can specialise in some
products to gain competitive advantage in the international market. This can be gained through
availability of raw materials, low-cost labour, a good production base for achieving economies of
scale, technology and/or patents in their favour. More than anything else it is the will to go global,
the mindset, which spurs fi rms into becoming MNCs, that is required to gain an absolute advantage.
Given next are the factors that add to the competitive advantage of fi rms:
<p>1. Labour cost, infrastructure, availability of raw materials.
2. Product demand in the home country. If the demand is large and the customers are discerning
<p>with regard to product quality, the fi rm could have the advantage of low-cost production having </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 131
<p>achieved the economies of scale. It would also have a good, consistently high-quality product
and such a fi rm can create customer satisfaction in other countries as well.
<p>3. The home country&rsquo;s trained manpower, technology base and patents help fi rms in the overseas
markets.
<p>4. Effective and effi cient policies and strategies, which are conducive to a fi rm&rsquo;s international
ventures.
<p>Firms take the route to global business via the basic competitive advantage of technology, raw
material availability and trained manpower. Next, fi rms with innovative products, which have found
a good market in the home country, consider that they can be successful overseas as well. Firms,
which have made considerable investments, plan overseas business to fully utilise the investment
so that they can amortise the investment over large volume business, which may not be possible in the
home country. Finally, once a fi rm becomes cash rich through international trade it plans venturing
overseas through large-scale investments in manufacturing and marketing in the host countries.
<p>Firms need to consider the following issues as they plan overseas business:
<p> 1. The host country&rsquo;s economic development, per capita income, gross domestic product (GDP)
futures and fi scal policies.
<p> 2. The host country&rsquo;s unemployment rates.
3. Currency values.
4. Wage levels.
5. Nature of competition.
6. Infl uence of regional pacts and free trade zones.
7. The host country&rsquo;s form of government and its stability.
8. Taxation levels.
9. Political ideology.
10. Money supply and interest rates.
11. Laws regarding foreign investments.
12. Trade regulations.
13. The host country&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s attitude towards foreign fi rms.
14. Level of protection to local fi rms.
15. Technology import rules.
16. Power availability and costs.
17. Infrastructure like telecommunications, roads and transport systems.
18. Social systems, values, languages, demographics and lifestyle.
19. Attitude towards foreigners.
<p>Before considering business options in other countries, this information must be gathered from a
known, reliable source.
<p>A competitive advantage scan is done along the following lines:
<p>1. High brand equity worldwide, at least in the region the fi rm wants to start its business.
2. Economy of scale in manufacturing.
3. Technological advantage through break-throughs and international patents.
4. Effi cient market research capability in the host country to understand the business opportunities
<p>available there.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management132
<p>5. A product, like the Mercedes car, which sells by itself, just by virtue of its name.
6. Strong international management, especially the top man, who can make a big difference just
<p>by his personal knowledge of the host country, its market, buying habits of the customers and
the nuances of the local language.
<p>Once a fi rm knows it has a competitive advantage in another country and its market is growing,
it should invest in that country and grow. In case the market is growing and the fi rm does not have
a competitive advantage, it should look for a niche market, fi nd a joint venture partner or divest.
In a country where the market is not growing and the fi rm does not have any advantage, it should
organise licensed production or divest after harvesting. In the event of having middling advantage
in a mildly attractive market, the fi rm should plan selective market segments.
<p>Selecting a Joint Venture Partner
<p>When fi rms go overseas, they are new to the host country, its fi nancial status, its social and cultural
milieu, its political outlook and they fi nd it useful to have a local partner who knows the country well
and who can steer the fi rm through the initial problems. Many fi rms have found that local partners
have not been able to provide the kind of assistance they were looking for and the partnership did
not fl ourish. Firms should not be in a hurry to fi nd partners. They should join hands only with like-
minded fi rms, who share the same aspirations, have similar goals and who would have an equal
stake in a joint venture.
<p>A truly multinational fi rm has the following attributes:
<p>1. Personnel selection is on a worldwide basis. It has managers of the home country working with
managers from a third country in the host country.
<p>2. The research and development (R&amp;D) department has wings in many countries with real-
time coordination; they may be working on several parts of one project or several separate
projects.
<p>3. Sourcing of fi nance is not limited to the home country and host country alone, but shares are
fl oated in several countries.
<p>4. The manufacturing base is spread across several countries.
5. Products are designed for global acceptance.
6. The fi rm&rsquo;s structure is a matrix or a mixed structure combining functions and a Strategic Business
<p>Unit (SBU), with the matrix taking product range, functions and geographic considerations into
account.
<p>Multinational Corporation Management
<p>The management style in host countries vary quite a bit ranging from totally authoritarian to a high
level of delegation of authority. Firms in countries like Malaysia and France are content to be ruled
by managers. Some countries like Greece and Japan want clear personnel policies about recruitment,
promotions and stability. Firms in countries like the US and Canada want individual authority,
delegation and accountability.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 133
<p>Most MNCs employ qualifi ed and trained persons of the host country to man the second level of
the management ladder, keeping the top positions for its own people. However, after the initial start
up period, the expatriates tend to become a heavy burden on the fi rm as besides getting overseas
salaries and home travel allowance, they are paid in the home country for maintaining their families.
In case the families move with them, then the expenses mount even further. Besides, the fi rm may
also have to pay the local income tax on behalf of the expatriates.
<p>In order to avoid these problems, fi rms like Unilever and IBM employ 95 per cent of their staff
from the host country. These fi rms have accumulated huge amounts of experience as MNCs. The
governments of several countries insist that MNCs must provide employment to the local people.
These MNCs start training and orientation programmes to bring the locals into the mainstream of
the home fi rm. The locals, being more attuned to the socio-culture ambience of the country, are able to
help the fi rm in planning customer communications better. Local managers can become a hindrance
when it comes to global thinking as they are concerned only about their country. A sound combination
of local and home-country managers is found to be most useful. The trust-building exercise with the
locals takes time, which can become a negative factor if the fi rm wants to start rolling at full speed
quickly. Daewoo Motors in India had some Indians in senior positions but they were never part of
the key decisions taken by the Koreans. The end results are there for all to see.
<p>Firms can consider adopting a global approach by fi lling key positions with the most suited per-
sons from around the world. European fi rms have adopted this principle; a Swiss fi rm had an Austrian
director in Singapore. While this could prove to be expensive, if a fi rm fi nds the right person, who
knows the market, the advantages could offset the extra expense. Firms looking for a person for their
international operations look for someone who is sensitive to new cultural nuances, adaptable enough
to accept changes and the resultant challenges, skilled to operate with a set of international team mem-
bers, besides being strategically alive to the changing business environment the world over.
<p>Management of a host fi rm/subsidiary away from the home country has become relatively easy
with faster telecommunications, computer networking and emails, as also the faster movement of
people and goods. The daily analysis of sales, payments received and made, and changes in the business
environments can be made without any time lag. Financial standings can be known by comparing
the actual expenses with the budgeted fi gure, the return on investment (ROI) with historical fi gures.
However, the host country profi t margins for the company get affected by the infl ation rate as well
as changes in taxation rates.
<p>Developing countries like India can fi nd the entry of MNCs a double-edged weapon; on one hand,
MNCs bring in technology, fi nance and management expertise; on the other, they also pose a threat
to the local industry. Repatriation of profi ts in foreign currency affects the host country&rsquo;s economy to
a large degree (it is only a relative term as the MNCs bring in fi nance in foreign exchange only).
<p>An MNC has business spread in several countries and investments, production facilities, market-
ing and procurement functions in many parts of the world. When multinational corporations enter
a new country, they initially try to adapt to the host country&rsquo;s way of product demand, for example,
Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL). Only when they are well established, do they bring in their
universally accepted products. The management needs to have international management skills as
also the mindset for operating globally. Firms look for international competitive advantage beyond
human resource, as these are now quite mobile around the globe. Firms that copy the product, the
&lsquo;me too&rsquo; people, who with a little expertise can bring a better product than the original, can dilute a
fi rm&rsquo;s technological advantage. Competitive advantage can be gained by proper strategic planning and
execution and by providing uniquely excellent service, which cannot be copied by the competition.
Regular monitoring of the general business and competitive environment, the host country&rsquo;s wage </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management134
<p>plans, tax laws, its rules about profi t repatriation, study of free trade zones, can all provide competitive
advantage to a fi rm. Differentiated products, economies of scale of manufacture, technological edge
and a top-quality business team add to the competitive advantage of fi rms.
<p>INTERNATIONAL BUYER&rsquo;S PROFILE
<p>At different times, each member of the world society is a buyer. And as a buyer people want to be
known as sane, intelligent buyers. A buyer&rsquo;s skills come from an innate selfi shness that when we are
spending money we should get our money&rsquo;s worth. The term value for money is born out of this
desire. To prove the rule, there are exceptions like people buying beyond their means when they
want to impress somebody, like friends or fi anc&eacute;es. It is said that no one buys a product; they buy the
benefi ts, which they derive from the product. If the benefi ts outweigh the cost the buyers have paid
then they have received value for money. Let us defi ne customer value as follows:
<p>1. Total customer value: The sum total of all the benefi ts the customer is likely to derive from the
product.
<p>2. Total customer cost: The sum of money the customer is to spend while selecting, buying, using
and disposing off the product.
<p>3. A product&rsquo;s perceived value: The difference between total customer value and total customer
cost represents the customer&rsquo;s idea of the usefulness of the product.
<p>Product purchase decisions are taken on the basis of the following:
<p>1. Product brand image/brand equity.
2. Buyer&rsquo;s usage value.
3. Value of the service provided through the product.
4. Intrinsic value of the product.
<p>These add up to total customer value of the product.
The other side of the decision to buy comes from the following:
<p>1. Product price.
2. Product search expense.
3. Decision time delay costs.
4. Cost while using the product.
<p>These factors add up to total customer costs for the purchase of the product.
In case the buyer and the user are two different persons, there is likelihood of delays or wrong
<p>purchases. Personal choice of the buyer may be based on his own personal experience with the product
or he may have some relationship with the seller. In such events, the sellers do well to establish
relationship with the buyers and the users as well.
<p>To reiterate, people do not buy products. They buy the benefi ts that the product offers them.
Therefore the after-purchase value of the product assumes great importance as only those products
with high after-purchase value will be purchased repeatedly, which brings us to the point of customer
satisfaction arising from the use of the product, which is measured as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 135
<p>1. Actual benefi t derived as compared to the benefi t perception the customer had before the
product was purchased.
<p>2. Benefi ts derived from the product as compared to those obtained from a competitive product.
3. Benefi ts get enlarged if the product costs are in consonance with the perceived benefi ts and in
<p>such cases the customers derive a sense of pride besides satisfaction, which in today&rsquo;s marketing
terminology is called customer delight.
<p>4. Customer delight also comes from being known as an intelligent buyer in one&rsquo;s peer group.
<p>Product innovation and product differentiation leads the buyers into the delight zone. As the com-
petition is doing exactly the same thing, that is, trying to win over the customers in the same segment,
the fi rm that remains proactive to the perceived and even intangible needs of the customers, is the
winner. In order to achieve this, fi rms must be in the market research mode all the time, trying to
fathom the customer, his mindset, likes and dislikes and his perception of product benefi ts. Product
differentiation should, however, be made at those extra costs which can be borne by the market. There
is no point in, as an extreme example, using gold wire in television sets instead of copper wire, because
except for increasing the cost it will not improve the quality or even the aesthetics of the product.
<p>Sustainable Competitive Advantage
<p>In order to achieve sustainable competitive advantage, a fi rm has to constantly upgrade its product
value to the customer and product delivery systems. International buyer&rsquo;s loyalty can never be taken
for granted and therefore to ensure it the company takes the following actions:
<p>1. Differentiating the product, price and distribution system and advertising promotion.
2. Communicating the differentiation to the customer&mdash;&lsquo;we know we are good, you should know
<p>it too&rsquo;.
<p>In the washing powder segment, the players are in a pitched battle with one another with each
one making tall claims of providing the whitest wash. They make use of television demonstrations
and make innovative use of the media to help achieve trial-use by the buyer. However, it is the real
value of the product, which aims for re-buys by the purchasers.
<p>In order to increase its market share, a fi rm has to take its competitor&rsquo;s customers. It is of use to know
the value the competitor&rsquo;s customers place on competitive products. Market surveys are conducted
by fi rms to know exactly the perception of their customers about the value of the product they have
purchased as well as that of competitor products purchased by them. The results of the surveys assist
in product differentiation, communication and service providing plans. These help the fi rms to keep
upgrading the customer value of the products.
<p>Satisfaction Survey
<p>International marketing fi rms need to know the satisfaction or dissatisfaction factors of the products
with their existing and past customers. The following methods are used for this purpose:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management136
<p>1. Personal interviews: Personal interviews are conducted with those customers who were using
the product earlier and have now stopped using the same, either because they have switched to
the competition or have stopped using the product altogether. These interviews give an insight
about the reasons and failure on the part of the fi rm in providing satisfaction. These apparent
post-mortems help rebuild the marketing strategies by improving service standards, terms of
business like payment terms and delivery systems.
<p>2. Surprise customers: Firms can send some random customers, who give correct feedback about
the service provided and customer care provided by the selling team. Such ghost customers are
part of many hotel chains which are interested to know the behaviour patterns of the service
team when the top management is not there to watch the team in action.
<p>3. Complaint management: Firms that do not pay attention to the suggestions and complaints
made by customers are likely to lose those customers. The top-most authority in the fi rm should
attend to complaints, or at least must be aware of the complaints. Suggestion boxes, complaint
or assessment forms to assess the service being provided are available in most hotels and re-
staurants and they form a vital link between the customers and their satisfaction.
<p>4. Customer complaint and suggestion surveys: One telecom fi rm in India in the private sector
interacts with its customers on a continuous basis in order to understand their varied and in-
creasing demands, their dissatisfaction levels and the fi rm has been able to fi nd instant remedial
measures for the same.
<p>5. Pricing strategies can help in making the customers loyal. A value for money product stays
with the customer and helps in making purchase decisions. Price changes, like lowering the
price can be helpful in penetrating the market. The inherent danger is the customer&rsquo;s mindset
as often a lower price product is considered as having lower value.
<p>Michael Porter&rsquo;s Value Chain
<p>Michael Porter evolved the concept of the value chain, which evaluates the customer value being built
in the product through the management process. The value chain looks at the different functional
areas of business from the customer&rsquo;s viewpoint and underscores the fact that if the customer is
forgotten in any action or activity of the fi rm, some value to the customer may get lost. Figure 5.1
shows the value chain.
<p>In Figure 5.1, infrastructure, human resources and information are support functions and the rest
are primary functions. As can be seen from the matrix given in Figure 5.1, success of the fi rm depends
<p>Figure 5.1 Value Chain

</div>

<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 137
<p>on the way the activities of each functional area are conducted and coordinated with each other.
As an example, if purchasing does not care to order the raw materials in time there will be delay in
production and delivery to the customer. If the human resource management gets the wrong kind
of person for operations, the quality of products may suffer, which might ultimately affect sales and
profi tability. If the outbound delivery uses an ineffective transport system there may be delays or
even damage to the goods, hampering customer satisfaction. Each activity should be carried out and
cared for as it adds value to the customer. If it is not performed well it will take away some value
from the customer resulting in loss of the customer to the fi rm, and competitors are ever ready to
grab dissatisfi ed customers all the time.
<p>Service to a customer is of paramount importance and this is one area, which most fi rms in India
tend to neglect. To a customer, the fi rm&rsquo;s service is the only visible face of the fi rm. Therefore the ser-
vice must represent the fi rm correctly by involving the customer to the extent possible in the service
delivery process showing the fi ner points like selection of transporters.
<p>Michael Porter&rsquo;s value chain, as stated earlier, has a major drawback inasmuch that it does not
render itself to cross-functional analysis in a fi rm. Cross-functional work processes and teams lend
themselves for better understanding on the total customer approach as discussed next:
<p>1. Defi ning new product: Firms keep bringing new products in the market. New products that
are brought out based on an understanding of the market through marketing research have
a better chance of success. The activities involved in defi ning new products include, besides
marketing research, technology through research and development, or purchase of technology
(in some cases through reverse engineering, if it is not illegal).
<p>2. Production process: This includes purchasing, inventory management of raw material,
components, semi-fi nished goods and fi nished goods with the just in time (JIT) technique for
keeping current assets to a minimum and quality management with total quality manage-
ment (TQM).
<p>3. Marketing and servicing the customers: This includes continuous market research, manage-
ment of the distribution channels, advertising and sales promotion. The process starts with
getting the purchase order to supplying the goods, billing them and fi nally getting paid for the
supply. Next, the same order-to-payment cycle restarts.
<p>4. Service: The importance of service to the customer can never be overemphasised as only the
service provides a fi rm with a sustainable competitive advantage as it cannot be easily copied.
<p>Firms strive for profi table sales and growth. These come from customers who become loyal to the
fi rm due to the satisfaction or delight they get from the product usage. Loyal customers normally
buy more, accept new products from the fi rm, become spokespersons for the fi rm and take up an ad-
visory role in a fi rm&rsquo;s operations, like new promotional plans, new advertising campaigns and some
customers can be the part of an advisory panel or focus group with the fi rm.
<p>Understanding customer satisfaction for profi ling the customer is therefore an absolute must in
these days of severe international competition. For fi rms to survive, it is vital to provide for the speedy
redress of complaints, removal of the cause of complaints and maintaining statistics about complaints.
Customers who are loyal to the fi rm must be retained as, over a period of time, the fi rm&rsquo;s selling cost
on such customers reduce as lots of activities become routine; newsletters and direct mail promotional
offers can be sent without having to bother about fi nding where the new customers are. They help
the fi rm with word-of-mouth publicity and help it get more customers. A lost customer can become
a major liability if he chooses to vilify the fi rm. Firms need to interview these lost customers and even </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management138
<p>if they become non-buyers of the fi rm&rsquo;s products, the fi rm should make sure that they should remain
friendly or at least neutral with respect to the fi rm.
<p>Selling in the Twentieth Century
<p>The process of selling of the early twentieth century has given way to relationship marketing of today
as can be seen in Figure 5.2.
<p>Figure 5.2 Selling in the Twentieth Century
<p>In the beginning of the twentieth century, there was hardly any competition and sellers had to just
place their product in the market and it was sold. Then came the 1950s and products, which needed
service, were provided with after-sales service through service engineers employed by the fi rm. They
also demonstrated the working of the product, if it was required, informed the buyer of ways to
optimise the use of the product and methods of possible savings through the use of the product like
lower down time. In the third phase, in the second half of the twentieth century, customers started
becoming quality conscious and fi rms started quality control programmes in their manufacturing
operations. From just testing the quality of the fi nal product, fi rms started checking the quality of the
raw materials and components and the quality of sub-assemblies inside the factories. In the next phase,
the customer became the focus of marketers and the products had to meet the expectation levels of the
customer. The seller made phone calls after the sale was made to ask about the quality assessment and
ease in usage of the product. However, as most products had little or no competition, manufacturers
were, in fact, giving only lip service to improving product quality. A classic example is the Ambassador
car. A new model of Ambassador was introduced with only a minor change&mdash;ashtrays on the back
door. After a few years, gradually the ashtrays were removed. They were again reintroduced in the
newer model. This game was obviously known to the customers but as they had little option, they
had to buy the car. Only, some bought the Fiat, the only other option.
<p>Relationship marketing is the new mantra of marketing today. It works well only when the seller
is able to overwhelm the customer with so much importance that he just cannot think of going for a
competitive product. Newsletters, new product information, samples for trial, invitations to cultural
activities and other such tools go a long way in building relationships.
<p>Relationship Marketing
<p>Relationship marketing helps in establishing and maintaining long-term satisfying relations with both
internal and external customers as well as suppliers (see Figure 5.3).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 139
<p>The relationship between the seller and the customer does not end once the sale has been made.
The seller continues to provide engineering support and maintenance support to the buyer to keep
reassuring about the benefi ts he is going to derive from the use of the product. This is especially true
in the case of industrial products like power plants and air-conditioning units.
<p>A proactive approach with the customer always helps to develop a better understanding and
increases the product image in relationship marketing. In this relation, Daewoo Electronics has made
a successful attempt by making it a practice to regularly pay visits to the customers and train them on
product usage. This has reduced the problem of customer complaints as most of the complaints come
from a lack of awareness on how to use a product especially in the case of consumer durables and
industrial goods. Pre-launch trial of drugs is yet another example of being proactive in infl uencing
customers.
<p>Summarising this, relationship marketing seems to possess the following characteristics:
<p>R &mdash; Reliability
E &mdash; Empathy towards stakeholders
L &mdash; Learning consumer behaviour
A &mdash; Assurance to customers
T &mdash; Technological advancement
I &mdash; Interaction with stakeholders
O &mdash; Objectives of marketing
N &mdash; Networking
S &mdash; Service
H &mdash; Higher growth
I &mdash; Innovation
P &mdash; Passion
<p>A seller&rsquo;s profi tability comes from the profi tability of his customers. An oil company (ESSO) adver-
tised &lsquo;Use our lubricating oils and increase your machinery life by 20 per cent. Additionally, servicing
downtime gets reduced by 10 per cent. The total saving for a machinery of million rupees would be
<p>Figure 5.3 External and Internal Customers</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management140
<p>ten thousand rupees per annum.&rsquo; (The best way is to actually calculate and give the savings in fi gures
along with the calculations, which will make the offer look authentic to the buyers.)
<p>Consumer behaviour can be defi ned as actions of consumers and their motives for those actions
of making purchases. The study of consumer behaviour is the study of how consumers spend time,
money and effort on consumption-related items. It includes what they buy, why they buy, when they
buy, where they buy, how often they buy and how often they use it?
<p>We are all consumers and we behave in different ways in the market place, sometimes logically
and at other times irrationally. The study of consumer behaviour helps to predict, with a high degree
of accuracy, how a particular person will behave under certain circumstances.
<p>The main marketing mix factors&mdash;the famous 4Ps, namely, product, price, placement and
promotion&mdash;can provide stimulus to the buyers. We have seen in our lives how a particular product
can just by being in the market make us buy it. Listed next are the infl uencing factors (these will be
discussed in detail later).
<p>SOCIAL FACTORS
<p>1. Reference groups: They are the community leaders, religious gurus, professors, counsellors
and others.
<p>2. Family: This includes parents, children, grandparents, siblings, uncles and aunts.
3. Roles and structures: The role of the head of the household, the breadwinner in the family,
<p>which could be a new one, just husband and wife, or with small children, teenage children, or
grown up children who have left the household need to be defi ned in the buying process.
<p>4. Age and stage in life cycle: With better medical facilities, the average age of Indians has greatly
increased. There is a large group of senior citizens. With a lower rate of child mortality, the
population of teens and preteens has increased signifi cantly giving rise to a multitude of needs
and products to satisfy the same.
<p>5. Occupation and economic circumstances: The standards of living of people differ according
to their income and their occupation. A white-collared worker would like to project an image
of a well-dressed person as against a small businessman, who would not be bothered with
appearances.
<p>6. Lifestyle and psychographics: These factors are used to understand the mindsets of people and
for measuring and categorising lifestyles.
<p>7. Good resource people: Those with fi nancial backing.
(a) Actualisers: Those who have achieved their desires, who have become somebody.
(b) Fulfi lled: Those who are satisfi ed.
(c) Achievers: These are people who have targeted their dreams and fulfi lled them.
(d) Experiencers: These are those people who have gone through struggles and come out
<p>successful.
8. Low resource people: Those with low fi nances.
<p>(a) Believers: They are optimists who feel their time will come soon.
(b) Strivers: They are hopeful about their future.
(c) Makers: These are busy people who are into the nitty-gritty of making a success of their
<p>lives.
(d) Strugglers: They are people who are not so optimistic about their future.</p>

<p>PERSONALITY AND SELF CONCEPT
<p>People have physiological needs like the need for food, clothing, shelter and psychological needs like
the need for love, esteem and self-actualisation. Maslow propounded the theory that people&rsquo;s needs
follow a hierarchy in terms of importance of needs and their place in a person&rsquo;s life (see Figure 5.4).
<p>Figure 5.4 Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs
<p>NEED SATISFACTION
<p>Perception: Select, organise and interpret information to obtain a meaningful understanding for
selecting and deciding in favour of a product.
Attitudes and beliefs: Attitudes are a person&rsquo;s evaluation of emotional feelings and tendencies for
action towards some object or an idea.
<p>Buying Roles
<p>Buying roles can be described as follows:
<p>1. Initiator: The person who puts forward the idea of obtaining a certain product.
2. Infl uencer: This is the person who gives his opinion about the suitability of the product.
3. Decider: This is a person who has the authority to decide whether a product should be purchased
<p>or not.
4. Buyer: This is the person who places the order for the product.
5. User: This is the person who puts the product to use.
<p>Thus, we can develop the complete buyer behaviour as given next:
<p>1. Believe in the product.
2. Develop attitudes.
3. Make thoughtful choice.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management142
<p>Habitual Buying Behaviour
<p>Habitual buying behaviour can be understood through Figure 5.5:
<p>Figure 5.5 Habitual Buying Behaviour
<p>Major difference in brands High involvement Low involvement
<p>Complex buying behaviour Variety-seeking buying behaviour
<p>Less difference in brands Dissonance reducing buying
behaviour
<p>Habitual buying behaviour
<p>When, for example the difference in brands is large, like in cars, and the involvement in buying is also
more, the buying process becomes complex. Conversely, if the brand difference is low, like in shampoos,
and purchase involvement is low, most purchases are done on the basis of habit only.
<p>The different stages of the buying decision process are:
<p>1. Problem recognition, which is defi ned by obvious or inherent needs of the consumer.
2. Information search.
3. Evaluation of alternatives.
4. Purchase decision.
5. Post-purchase behaviour.
<p>Sources of information could be:
<p>1. Personal: Family, friends, neighbours.
2. Commercial: Advertisements, salespersons, dealers, packages, displays.
3. Public sources: Mass media, consumer rating organisations.
4. Experiment: Handling the product, experiments, using samples of products like shampoo
<p>sachets.
<p>The evaluation of alternatives can be demonstrated by the following example:
<p>Problem: Purchasing a computer.
<p>Decision-making criteria are as follows:
<p>1. Price
2. Manufacture/model
3. Support
4. Repair record
5. Warranties
6. Reliability</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 143
<p>Weight given to the criteria by the consumer:
<p>1. Price&mdash;70
2. Manufacture/model&mdash;60
3. Support&mdash;40
4. Repair record&mdash;75
5. Warranties&mdash;50
6. Reliability&mdash;70
7. Alternatives: Wipro, LG, HCL, Compaq, IBM, local assembly
<p>Now for each of these six computer manufacturers put weight on the criteria as has been done
for the fi rst:
<p>1. Wipro: Price&mdash;30, manufacture/model&mdash;50, support&mdash;40, repair record&mdash;60, warranty&mdash;40,
reliability&mdash;60.
<p>As can be seen, weight given to price is inversely proportional to price. In other words, the
higher the price, the lower the weight given to it.
Select the one where the numbers add up to the highest. Then implement the decision and
make the purchase.
<p>Post-purchase behaviour comes from satisfaction, use and disposal after use.
Buying behaviour is determined by ethics in marketing, which are required to sell products and
<p>give value for money to the customers. In other words, non-ethical behaviour can lead to de-motivation
of buyers since once the seller is caught cheating by the buyer, the latter would stop buying from the
former. Non-standard products, defective goods, prices that give the wrong impression to buyers
(hidden charges like transport, taxes and duties that are not mentioned in the beginning), and short
packing are some areas of unethical practice. Such deals can give only short-term benefi ts and in the
long run even if the law does not catch up, the customers eschew purchasing such goods and dealing
with such marketers. In the bargain, even good products marketed by that fi rm are viewed as suspect.
A few examples will clarify the issue:
<p>1. Food items mixed with unhygienic products like non-food grade preservatives.
2. Fake branded products.
3. Products like video and audio tapes which are pirated.
4. Quoting different prices to customers for standard products, unless quantity discounts are
<p>being offered.
5. Advertising a hotel as a fi ve-star one when it does not have even three-star facilities.
6. Advertising contraband goods like liquor and drugs.
7. Cheating in annual sales where the prices are jacked up from original so that the &lsquo;discounted&rsquo;
<p>price is the same as the original price.
<p>Incorrect or misleading advertising should be fi rmly avoided. It can cause untold harm including
legal action, which has become one of the deterrents of such advertisements today.</p>

<p>International Marketing Management144
<p>Market Segmentation
<p>Markets are such heterogeneous places that unless we get to understand each part of it we remain
ignorant of the market. At one end of the spectrum we have people buying Mercedes cars while there
are also people in the market for low-cost bicycles as means of transport. Marketers of Mercedes com-
municate with the rich, elitist class to sell their product. People who are likely to purchase a Mercedes
reside in certain sections of the town, visit particular clubs, read particular business magazines like
Business India, Business Today and India Today. The person who wishes to purchase a low-cost bicycle
is likely to go to cinema halls for low-cost entertainment. Cycle sellers can advertise their products in
the form of fi lm clips at movie halls to communicate to their target segment, while the manufacturers
of the Mercedes can advertise their product in publications that the elite subscribe to. Both segments
would get the right message without too much clutter and in a language understood by them. Therefore,
market segmentation helps both&mdash;the buyers and the sellers.
<p>Market segmentation is done on the following lines:
<p>1. Geographic factors
2. Demographic factors
3. Psychological factors
4. Socio-cultural factors
5. Use-related factors
6. Benefi t segment
7. A combination of some of the factors mentioned here
<p>In India, Tanishq watches have the following segments:
<p>As its price range is Rs 20,000&ndash;Rs 125,000, it is the high income, elite and fashionable people
who form its market segment. Market communication, advertisement can thus be written in the
language easily understood by the segment and placed in the media seen and read by them.
<p>GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
<p>Each region of India has its own peculiarities in terms of customer needs and therefore consumer be-
haviour too is different for each area. In each region there are large metro areas, large cities, smaller towns
and villages. Urban, semi-urban and rural divide provides another basis for market segmentation.
<p>DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTATION
<p>Demographic segmentation is done in terms of age, sex, marital status, income, education and
occupation.
<p>Age segment is important as with the growing population of senior citizens and a large teenage
group, product needs for these segments are increasing. Healthcare products, vacation time products
are needed for elder citizens. Teens need coffee bars, discos and video game parlours.
<p>Income separates people in terms of their buying patterns and product groups. Marketers can
decide to cater to one income group or the other, make products needed by them, and then advertise
in the media most seen and read by them. Low-cost readymade garments for the low-income segment </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 145
<p>are best advertised on radio and in the local language press. Likewise Rolex watches for the rich
segment can be advertised in business magazines and TV channels such as Star Plus.
<p>There are several products that are sex specifi c. For example, shaving creams are meant for men
while lipsticks are meant for women. The reasons for the use of cosmetics vary by age and marketers
can make use of this fact by offering different products for different age groups. It is believed that young
girls need cosmetics to make themselves attractive to the opposite sex. Similarly, it is perceived that
married women use cosmetics to keep their husbands happy and senior ladies use them to feel young.
<p>EDUCATIONAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGMENTATION
<p>Customers who are well-read would buy books of their interest. A professor of management would
buy books on management. Similarly, a person&rsquo;s occupation can bring to focus his needs and desires
for products. A model, for instance, would go for lifestyle products as well as products for keeping
his/her body in the best of shapes.
<p>PSYCHOLOGICAL/PSYCHOGRAPHICS SEGMENTATION
<p>People&rsquo;s needs like shelter, food, safety, affection and self-actualisation make for different segments.
These are the hierarchies of needs according to Maslow.
<p>Psychological/psychographic segmentation divides customers around their mindsets. People need
ego boosting and certain products like fashion garments, designer watches and accessories make them
feel good when they can have their heads in the cloud nine. People can be motivated to buy a car just
because they have been selected to test drive it. Today&rsquo;s business executive is extremely busy and
his/her involvement in buying daily need products is low. The target customer therefore is the buyer
and not the user, who may be the servant or some retired member of the family. The involvement
increases with the value of purchase or some personal preference. Please-buy-only-Godrej-Shaving-
cream-for-me is a way in which the involvement manifests itself.
<p>SOCIO-CULTURAL SEGMENTATION
<p>Family
<p>Starting out in life, young people are unmarried. They need household goods like cleaning equipment,
washing machines, cooking equipment, TV set.
<p>Married couples initially need to go on honeymoon and later-on according to their status and in-
come buy a car, house and soon baby food and diapers. Once the children grow up, music system,
books, games and sports equipment are needed. As the children move out of home, the aging parents,
now alone again, require healthcare products and medicines.
<p>Society
<p>Social groups originate from parity in income, occupation and education. Lots of purchases, especially
of consumer durables, are made because one&rsquo;s neighbours have purchased them. &lsquo;Keeping up with </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management146
<p>the Joneses&rsquo; is the phrase used to describe this tendency of copying, common in one social segment.
Advertising based on targeting one social group becomes easy as the group members speak the same
language, understand the same subtleties, the same comic situations and have the same attitudes
and beliefs.
<p>Cultural and Sub-cultural Segmentation
<p>Our country boasts of unity in diversity. Cultural differences are quite pronounced as we travel from
north to south, east to west. In the north, for instance, when guests come to visit, offering them anything
in 3&rsquo;s is considered inauspicious, while in the south it is the done thing. Traditional women keep their
heads covered in the north on auspicious occasions while this is not the case in the south.
<p>Sub-cultural segments can be seen as well. The Punjabi and Rajasthani cultures, while both belong-
ing to the north Indian culture, are quite different from one another. Punjabi culture with its exuberant
dances, music, extrovert lifestyle, is very different from the Rajasthani culture which is more con-
servative and traditional, although they also have their own dances and music. Each area in India has
a fund of cultural heritage, which drives the segment members to behave in a certain manner. Durga
Puja sees Bengali&rsquo;s buying dresses, decoration material and the like.
<p>With global marketing becoming important in India, one has to be aware of the cultural diversity
across the world. Simple things like colour are important cultural factors that need to be kept in mind.
For example, cycles exported to Iran might be returned if they are not in green&mdash;Iran&rsquo;s favourite colour.
This subject will be discussed in detail in Chapter 15 (&lsquo;Advertising and Promotion in International
Markets&rsquo;).
<p>SEGMENTATION ON THE BASIS OF USAGE
<p>Imagine a person who buys a cellphone and uses it only to see the number calling him and then goes
to the nearest fi xed phone to call back. Another person uses cellphone the whole day, making long-
distance calls to his foreign clients and collaborators. Or, a person who stays in a fi ve-star hotel only
for one day in a year, eats outside the hotel and pays a room rent of about Rs 6,000, as against a person
who stays at a fi ve-star hotel at least for a week every month, throws parties and uses the hotel facilities
and his yearly bill exceeds Rs 1,000,000. While it is understood that the customer is king, we can
now see that while some customers are emperors, others are kings, some are princes and yet others
are just buyers. That is why to lure big buyers, fi rms have special treats for them like frequent fl yer
programmes offered by many airlines and room upgrades for frequent customers in hotels. It must,
however, be kept in mind that today&rsquo;s prince can become tomorrows emperor and hence fi rms can
ill-afford to neglect to provide the best possible service to him.
<p>SITUATION USAGE SEGMENTATION
<p>Situational usage is prevalent for greeting cards, fl owers, gift items that are given on occasions like
Christmas, Deepavali and Eid. Card makers and gift suppliers focus their advertising efforts towards
the customers.</p>
<br>

<p>BENEFIT SEGMENTATION
<p>People are looking for benefi ts all the time, like the calorie-conscious person who wants tasty food
with low calories. Insurance agents sell insurance promising life-long benefi ts. In fact, marketing is
based on making customers aware of the benefi ts the fi rm&rsquo;s products provide like value for money
and/or some unique features.
<p>Advertising: A Means of Communication
<p>Demographic and psychographic analyses guide fi rms in their advertising communications by making
them understand the following:
<p>1. Who are our target markets?
2. What should we tell them?
3. Where this communication should be made?
<p>Media too arranges such research and information so that fi rms know which media to use for which
segment. In India, the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) gives the circulation fi gures of different
publications and an idea of their readership. For TV, research organisations arrange for television rating
points (TRPs), which give an area-wise idea of viewership of TV channels and their programmes.
<p>Segmentation and Its Usage in Advertising
<p>In order to ensure effective communication, the target segment should be clearly defi ned. It should
not be too small or too large. It should be growing and should have access to advertising media.
Locating and identifying segments is easy for geographic or demographic segments. For identify-
ing psychological/psychographic and user segments, market surveys with properly designed
questionnaires and good reliable teams who are aware of the objective and well conversant with the
methodology analysis and report writing are needed.
<p>For products like expensive watches, while the segment in a town like Delhi would comprise a few
thousand, for Mercedes it may be a few hundred only. The segment interested in a trout safari may
be still smaller. The target segment should be stable and increasing. People trying out new brands all
the time are unstable buyers and cannot be counted for the segment. Marketers have to communi-
cate to the segment and availability of suitable and economical media becomes a necessity.
<p>Motivation is the inner urge that propels people to act. Seeing and smelling food gets people
motivated to eat even when they are not hungry (see Figure 5.6).
<p>When a person needs a product and he is unable to fulfi l his need, he suffers till he decides to buy
the product and satisfy his need.
<p>People have two types of needs&mdash;physiological, that is, requirements of their bodies, and
psychological needs of the mind. Food, water, clothing and shelter are the primary physiological </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management148
<p>needs, while the needs of power, self-esteem, affection and love are the secondary and psychological
ones. House may be the primary need but a bungalow where you can entertain guests becomes
psychological secondary need.
<p>Changing Nature of Goals and Needs
When a particular goal or need cannot be fulfi lled, a substitute goal emerges. Similarly, after fulfi lment
a new goal or need arises. In any case, needs can never be fully satisfi ed. When a person becomes the
vice president of a fi rm, he changes his goal to becoming the president. Product updates and newer
technologies help fi rms to use this urge as a springboard for launching innovative products.
<p>Once the basic needs are fulfi lled, people want to achieve higher goals. After getting a good house to
live in, people want to become community leaders. As the saying goes, &lsquo;Nothing succeeds like success&rsquo;.
Success gives extra fi llip to people for going to higher-level goals. Failure, on the other hand, makes
people redefi ne their goals, by either lowering their standards or taking a different road altogether.
<p>Goal substitution occurs on non-attainment of goals. If you cannot buy a Honda City car, you buy
a Maruti 800. Some people go into a dreamworld devoid of reality. Non-achievement causes people
to go into depression, which can result in behavioural changes like sulking and going into a shell,
anger, rationalisation of failure that is bad as it makes a person complacent and frustrated.
<p>Behaviour is oriented towards achieving personal goals. People have general types of goals and
then they have product-oriented goals. We will travel to the hills once I purchase my Ford Ikon car becomes
a product- and action-oriented goal. We can see that everyone has rational and emotional motivations,
with purely objective or subjective criteria.
<p>Motivational Research
Motivational research is conducted as psychoanalysis of consumer&rsquo;s minds to understand, sometimes
not so apparent reasons for their motives. The subconscious mind works for reasons of its own. Some
product personality types have been profi led as a result of motivational research as follows:
<p>1. Baking: It conveys motherhood, femininity, love and caring; subconsciously the baking process
is a substitute for the childbirth process.
<p>Figure 5.6 Buyer&rsquo;s Motivation</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 149
<p>2. Ice cream: It is subconsciously associated with love and affection.
3. Home maintenance kit: It defi nes man and machismo.
4. Beer: It represents active, alive people.
<p> Personality is the sum total of individual traits of character, bearing and behaviour.
<p>It allows us to fi ne-tune the differences among various people. With effort, people can change their
personality; from introverts they can become extroverts, from careless types they can become the caring
types. Sigmund Freud developed the psychoanalytical theory of personality. According to Freud,
human personality consists of three overlapping areas&mdash;id, superego and ego (see Figure 5.7).
<p>Figure 5.7 Id, Ego and Superego
<p> Id is the primitive animal-like instinct, which drives a person&rsquo;s hunger, thirst and sex urges.
A lot of advertising uses this animal force to its advantage and that is why in advertisements
the female form is used to attract males and vice-versa.
Superego is the mind&rsquo;s control on id, the animal instincts, so that people can live within
social norms.
Ego is the balancing force between id and superego, helping people to keep to the right
path between id&rsquo;s drive and societal norms.
<p>FREUDIAN THEORY AND BRAND/PRODUCT PERSONALITY
<p>Some products are best represented by a celebrity. Shah Rukh Khan, for instance, can be envisaged
as Mr Santro, the brand of car he has advertised successfully. He is also recognised as Shah Rukh
Mayur Khan due to the strong association between the actor and Mayur Suitings. Customers tend
to associate brands with the brand personality. Hence, marketers need to use a personality who can
be fully identifi ed with the product. Hritik Roshan promotes Coke and yet, as there have been many
personalities who have promoted Coke, it is diffi cult to identify Hritik Roshan with Coke.
<p>POST-FREUDIAN PERSONALITY THEORIES
<p>Unlike Freud, other social scientists felt that motives cannot be confi ned to basic and sexual instincts.
Social interaction and lifestyle too motivate people to act. According to the post-Freudian theorists,
there are four types of personalities as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management150
<p>1. Thinking and sensing types, who are rational, logical, objective and fast decision-makers.
2. Feeling and sensing types, who believe in their own selves, are subjective and they consult
<p>others while making decisions.
3. Thinking and intuiting types, who take a broad view, look for a wider range of options and
<p>take decisions for the long term.
4. Feeling and intuitive types, who take a broad view. They are people-oriented who take subjective
<p>decisions for the long term.
<p>People can be classifi ed in three personality types:
<p>1. Compliant types who seek company, want love and appreciation.
2. Aggressive types who go against others and try to excel to gain admiration.
3. Detached types who remain away from others, want independence from interference and are
<p>keen to be solo winners.
<p>Let us discuss consumer materialism and compulsive buying. Materialistic people enjoy buying
valuable goods and showing them off, which makes them egocentric and self-centred. They believe
that their possessions will project their lifestyle and yet no possession gives them real satisfaction
because the more you have the more you want and there is no end to wanting.
<p>Compulsive buying makes people buy things, which either they do not need or cannot afford. Sale
offers and mail orders catch those people who are on a buying spree.
<p>Consumers get an image of the product on their mental screen. Marketers have to position their
products in the right market segment to ensure that a positive mental image is formed and that it
stays. Repetition of advertisements is meant to fi x the product on the mind&rsquo;s screen.
<p>Pepsi has been positioned as a drink for the youth and, as youth remains the biggest segment
of consumers, Coke targets the youth too. Maruti 800 is positioned as the common man&rsquo;s car while
Honda City has the slot of an upper class car. Raymond Suiting is in the top position for the elite
while Mayur Suiting is for the middle class.
<p>The perceived price can be high, low or fair. Then there is differential pricing like low-priced air
tickets for senior citizens. There are sale prices when heavy discounts are offered, like offers that
promise a savings of up to 50 per cent, or promise the customer that they can buy more at a lower
price. Such offers can be deceptive, as the correct picture is not given to the consumers. While people
feel happy at making purchases and acquiring products, if the price is the same as imagined by the
buyer, then it does not give any pleasure. However, if the perceived price turns out to be more than
the actual price then the transaction becomes interesting to the buyer. For example, buying a 200 litre
refrigerator would normally cost a buyer Rs 14,000. If it costs him just that in the market, then there
is no joy for the customer. However, if the purchase price is Rs 13,500, it gives mental satisfaction
and pleasure to the buyer.
<p>Most often, especially for consumer goods, the price and quality of a product get associated with
each other and reduction in price can create doubts about the reduction in quality of the product.
Similarly, product, country, quality and price are perceived by the customers as a package, as can be
seen from the following:
<p>1. Made in the USA implies best quality and high price.
2. Made in Germany implies solid in technology, medium price.
3. Made in Japan implies that the product is elegant, not sturdy and its price is quite high.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 151
<p>4. Made in Korea implies that the product is almost as good as a similar product made in Japan
but at a lower price.
<p>5. Made in India implies low labour cost, low price and inconsistent quality.
<p>This perception is not correct any more but Brand India needs to be strengthened to overcome
this perception.
<p>PRICE AND QUALITY RELATIONSHIP
<p>One has to take into account that every product has some service attached to it.
<p>Figure 5.8 Price and Quality Relationship
<p>There are different types of consumers with unique personalities. There are consumers ready
to experiment and they buy products in the introductory stage of the product life cycle. Computer
notepads, palm-top computers fi nd a good market among this type of personality, who are always
ready to innovate and experiment.
<p>Dogmatic types have rigid behaviour patterns. When this type buys a new product it is contrary to
their belief. Therefore they have to be on the defensive and are uncomfortable with such purchases.
They can be persuaded by authoritative, dramatic and dynamic advertisements, which help them over-
come their basic negative attitude. Open-minded consumers take to new products easily. The social
types are self-centred people who look for answers within themselves while extroverts are ready and
at times eager to fi nd out what their peers and seniors have to say (who says what becomes important
and a signifi cant purchase-decision tool).
<p>Stimulation levels are important guides for the study of consumer behaviour. Some consumers
lead a sedate life and a minimum level of curiosity arousal is enough for them to become interested
in the product. Some are hardcore consumers who need to be shaken out of their slumber and for
them a heavy dosage of stimulation is needed. They can practically psyche themselves into the
purchase mood.
<p>Attitudes are predisposition levels people have towards a product or an idea. These positive or
negative attitudes are based on earlier experience, odd remark heard from a known or even unknown
person, from persons like salesmen connected to the product, the environment or mood in which the
message about the product was given to the consumer.
<p>Attitudes are normally consistent for a particular product. If a thing is not liked then it is not to be
purchased. Housewives may not even think of purchasing a twin-drum washing machine if they are
aware of the benefi ts of a single-drum machine. At times attitudes change for reasons like the need
to economise or non-availability of the favourite brand in the shop visited and imminence of need.
Decisions like &lsquo;Let us buy Godrej soap as Lux is not in stock&rsquo; for FMCG purchases are taken easily as </p>

<p>International Marketing Management152
<p>the cost of replacement or repurchase is not heavy, unlike a consumer durable product like a car or
TV, which cannot be purchased everyday.
<p>The communication process is planned taking into account the target market segment and the
mindset of the people of that segment. One communication model is given in Figure 5.9.
<p>Figure 5.9 Communication Process
<p>In communications, the credibility of the source, or who is saying it, matters a lot. A fi rm&rsquo;s brand
equity can authenticate what is being put in the advertisements. Most fi rms use endorsers to talk
about their products, which make the target segment believe in the product. Wrong endorsers can
cause harm to the product or can have no impact rendering the advertisement useless. A top heroine
endorsing washing powder may not have any impact as people know that she does not wash her
clothes herself. When she endorses a beauty cream, however, people believe her.
<p>The sender or source&rsquo;s credibility is important as it defi nes how or how much the receiver is going
to believe it. Negative impressions, like one must take the information with a pinch of salt, come with
unreliable senders of information. Use of endorsers becomes necessary in such cases. The source or
sender has his own need for sending the message. How right is that need? For example, many fi rms
resort to having yearly sales of their products. People want to know if it is a genuine sale and if yes,
why the fi rm is selling good products at heavily discounted prices? Is it that they have odd-sized
unsold products or a heavy inventory as their export order got cancelled or is it that the discounted
prices are in fact the same as the original? Such types of sales lose their impact in no time and give a
bad reputation to the seller.
<p>Personal involvement is the key factor that determines the interest the customer is going to have
in understanding and correctly interpreting the message. Sachin Tendulkar would in all likelihood
want to understand the exact specifi cations of a cricket bat, while a non-cricket playing TV com-
mentator may just take no notice of the bat.
<p>Moods of people at the time they are receiving the message govern how well they will receive and
accept the message. Watching a sad movie on TV would make people less willing to accept positive
aspects of a product. It calls for proper selection of media; sitcoms, news bulletins and movie-based
programmes are generally viewed on TV with a happy frame of mind.
<p>In order to monitor customer response to a message and its media, pre-testing is done where the
advertisement is shown to a select group of the market segment to gauge their reaction and get their
feedback. In case of a poor response, corrections in message and media can be made.
<p>After the advertisement has been released, post-testing is done to fi nd out how effectively the
advertisement has met its objectives.</p>
<br>

<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 153
<p>PERSUASION STRATEGY
<p>For the message to have the proper impact, selection of the market segment to be catered to, creativity
of the advertisement and objectives associated with the communication are key elements of strategy.
Some examples are discussed next:
<p>1. Housewife, family income Rs 20,000 per month, urbanite, graduate, would be reading Femina,
Cosmopolitan, Star Dust, watching afternoon soap operas like, Saans, Santa Barbara, Dynasty.
<p>2. College student, family income Rs 40,000 per month, would be reading sports, motorcycle and
car magazines, listening to FM radio.
<p>3. Achiever, family income Rs 80,000 per month, would be reading business magazines like Business
India, Business Today, national and international fi nancial newspapers and watching news on
Star TV.
<p>4. Senior citizen, family income Rs 20,000 per month, would be reading health- and investment-
related magazines, watching travel-related TV programmes for enjoying vicarious adventure
and thrills.
<p>5. Computer addicts would be surfi ng the internet and the best media for communicating to them
about software updates would be the web.
<p>6. There is always crossover in segments. For instance, for a person with a monthly income of
Rs 10,000, a woollen suit worth Rs 5,000 may be out of reach. However, he may buy it at least
for his wedding.
<p>Persuasion comes in the form of the personal infl uence of somebody who counts. In our daily lives
we communicate with other people in social, political or business situations. A good communicator
listens more than s/he speaks. When in doubt, we seek advice, or sometimes we get advice that is
totally unsolicited. In both cases, it is stored in the brain from where it can be retrieved at the time of
making a decision on a purchase. We normally go to people whom we consider as more knowledgeable
than us. These people are the opinion leaders. While buying a set of golf clubs it is best to ask a golf
champion rather than a layman for advice. For cameras and fi lms, a professional photographer, not
a camera salesperson, would be the best adviser.
<p>Opinion leaders in the international markets must be people or leaders who are well known in the
host countries, are experts in their fi elds and can be trusted to give a correct opinion on issues related
to their area of specialisation. Marketers, on the other hand, would invariably provide information
only about the positive aspects of their products.
<p>Several times customers seek only information and sometimes they ask for advice. From the
following you can distinguish which is an opinion and which, an advice:
<p>1. Which is the best gent&rsquo;s shoe for formal wear?&rsquo;
&lsquo;In my view, Bata is still the best.&rsquo;
<p>2. How often do you use the vacuum cleaner?
&lsquo;I use it once a week to clean the carpet, the curtains, the fl oors and the ceiling. You could
do the same.&rsquo;
<p>3. Where should I take my Maruti for servicing in Delhi?
&lsquo;There is no better place than Competent Motors, my dear.&rsquo;
<p>4. Where can I get a gift for my girlfriend/boyfriend?
&lsquo;Try Giggles in CP and you will not go wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management154
<p>As can be seen, opinion leaders are mostly &lsquo;product&rsquo; specifi c. You will not ask your milkman where
to buy computer software. In case of doubt, people take a second or even a third opinion until they
are satisfi ed with the opinion. People with set ideas often stop after they have got an opinion, which
agrees with their own thinking. Such subjective opinions can be misleading and may result in wrong
decisions.
<p>Advertisers extend the theory of opinion leadership in advertising by using the leaders as product
endorsers.
<p>Self-image is the sum total of how a person thinks about himself and it is a guiding factor in deciding
on a purchase along with the wisdom of opinion leaders. &lsquo;What type of person am I? What image do
I project to outsiders? How do people view my personality?&rsquo; These all make for self-image. There are
several types of self-image:
<p>1. How people view themselves.
2. How they want others to view them.
3. How they would like to be seen in the future.
<p>Self-image and products purchased have an interesting connection. An industrialist buys a
Mercedes to project the self-image of a successful person. Actors and actresses want to look good
and attractive to their fans and their clothes and make-up is meant to focus on that image. Marketers
take advantage of this by using this concept while communicating to them.
<p>Consumer perception is the consumer&rsquo;s view of things including messages and stimuli seen by or
focused on him. These perceptions are given or acquired by visual stimulus, like seeing pictures of
products in advertisements, hearing about the products from friends and displays as retail shops,
point of purchase (POP) display and the visual impact of the product.
<p>To heighten the impact, advertisers use sensational gimmicks including adventure sports, pretty
women as sex objects to make an impact. The level of minimum stimulation, which can attract a per-
son, is called the threshold level. For two different stimuli, the minimum difference, which becomes
noticeable, is known as just noticeable difference (JND).
<p>According to Weber&rsquo;s Law, an approximate accurate generalisation in psychology, the smallest
change in intensity of a stimulus is capable of being perceived as proportional to the intensity of the
original stimulus.
<p>For example, car polish makers might add some ingredients in the product that makes the lustre
last for a week as compared to a competitive product where the shine lasts for four days. The danger
in making it better, to the extent that the shine lasts for a month or even a fortnight, is that it would
increase the gap between purchases. Marketers and advertisers use the JND to good use in their
product development and advertising strategy.
<p>Subliminal perception considers even below the JND stimulus as psychologists have found that
even such stimulus leaves an impression on the subconscious level and while it remains dormant
it may manifest itself at the right time when product purchase is being considered. A friend
might have said years ago that the best TV set is from Sony. While fi nalising the purchase decision
this bit of information might come as bolt from the blue to one&rsquo;s head and a decision in favour of a
Sony TV set might be made.
<p>Hence, the decision-making process is based on the complex nature of human insights, which
marketers fi nd ways to stimulate and bring to surface in their favour. Marketing and communicating
to the target market segment about a new innovative product calls for sustained efforts of advertising,
personal selling and word-of-mouth appreciation of the product for a period of time.</p>
<br>
</div>

<p>International Competitive Advantage and Buyer&rsquo;s Profile 155
<p>Market-based new products are products that the market considers as new. When Airtel introduced
cellular phones in Delhi, they were new to the market and consumers took it as such.
<p>Consumer based new products are the one&rsquo;s which the consumers fi nd totally new.
The innovative or new product is seen by the fi rm as new to it and the fi rm becomes buoyant about it.
<p>The fi rm ignores the fact that the product may not be new to the market as competitors may already
have introduced the same.
<p>Product innovation takes into account the features, which are unique to the product. For example,
a refrigerator manufacturer might claim to have a novel door-cooling system, not available in other
refrigerators.
<p>Development of the new product can be on a continuous basis or on a one-off basis. The telecom
industry has had both types of innovations as can be seen from Table 5.1
<p>Table 5.1 Product Development Process
<p>Discontinuous development Dynamic, continuous development Continuous development
<p>Telephone Answering machine, voice mail Auto-dialing facility, memory
phones
<p>Pager Nation-wide paging, two-way
paging, sports scores
<p>Message displays, alarm clocks
<p>Fax Fax modem, mobile fax Speed dial, delayed dispatches
<p>Consumers look for relative advantages in each product. Also the expense of making the change and
the product&rsquo;s compatibility with other products that the consumer has also play an important role
in the decision to buy new products. For example, a consumer wishing to purchase a modem and a
printer must ensure that they are compatible with his computer.
<p>Organisational Buying Behaviour
<p>Organisations or fi rms involved in manufacturing goods purchase raw materials and components
needed in the manufacturing process. They also buy consumables like electricity, water and gas,
which are consumed, in the manufacturing process. Such purchases by the fi rms have the following
characteristics:
<p>1. Fewer buyers but large quantity buyers.
2. Close supplier and buyer relationship.
3. Geographic concentration of buyers.
4. Derived demand.
5. Inelastic demand/fluctuating demand.
6. Professional purchasing.
7. Several buying infl uences.
<p>Firms produce large volumes of products and hence need large quantities of materials. An individual
will buy a TV picture tube only as a replacement only if his TV set&rsquo;s picture tube has become defective. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management156
<p>A TV set manufacturer will be buying picture tubes in thousands for putting them in the TV sets. Yet
as compared to individual buyers, TV set manufacturers will be far less in number.
<p>In most cases, industries are established near the source of one or two major raw materials needed
for manufacture. Hence, most industries are concentrated in that area. Gujarat has lots of cotton, which
accounts for the large number of textile mills in that region.
<p>The demand for raw materials is derived from the plan of manufacture of products, which use the
material. For example, tyre sales are dependent on the number of cars manufactured in a particular
period. For such intermediary products the demand remains inelastic over long periods of time with
only marginal changes. However, it could also change dramatically in case the buyers fi nd different
usages of the product. This will result in an increase in demand. If the product becomes obsolete, the
demand could just disappear, as happens often in the case of fashion garments. Purchase in such cases
becomes a professional discipline. Depending on the value in money terms and also in availability
terms, the importance is given to purchase decisions.
<p>Buying situations can be classifi ed as follows:
<p>1. First-buy is when a new fi rm makes the purchases or an old fi rm tries out a new product.
2. Re-buy takes place when a satisfi ed buyer buys the product again. This happens when besides
<p>the product other factors like the fi rm&rsquo;s after-sales service, are to the buyer&rsquo;s satisfaction.
3. Modifi ed re-buy is made when the manufacturer accepts the customer&rsquo;s suggestions and the
<p>product is suitably modifi ed to suit the fi rm.
4. New task purchase depends on the launch of new products and is planned accordingly.
<p>The system for buying in an organisation consists of the following people:
<p>1. Initiators: These are the people who place the requirement of the product before the fi rm&rsquo;s
authorities. In most fi rms they would either be research and development persons or purchase
executives.
<p>2. Users: These are the people who defi ne the product with specifi cations and would ultimately
use it. They are the research and development engineers, production engineers and the like.
<p>3. Infl uencers: These are the people who infl uence the purchase decision, that is, which brand,
model to buy, from which dealer. These could be research and development managers,
consultants and the like.
<p>4. Deciders: These are the authorised people who decide on the spending of money for making
the purchase. They are of the rank of general managers.
<p>5. Approvers: These are the people with the power of approving the purchase like chief executive
offi cers and managing directors.
<p>6. Gatekeepers: These are those who fi lter information and see to it that only relevant information
reaches the decision-makers about the product. These could be receptionists and purchasing
agents.
<p>Consumer behaviour in organisational buying therefore becomes complex, with a number of
persons involved in the decision-making process. Therefore unlike in consumer products, the role of
advertisement in organisational buying is limited to image-building of the fi rm and providing detailed
information to the buyers about the products.</p>

possibility of successful results in a fi rm. These are:
<p>1. Customer
2. Finance
3. Operations
4. Organisation
<p>CUSTOMER
<p>A fi rm works for the customers, earns profi ts and grows because of them; it needs to know its
market share and brand value. A fi rm&rsquo;s position is determined by its competitive advantage over
competition. Firms gain competitive advantage by one or all of the following means:
<p>1. Achieving uniqueness over competition, in the product, price, placement and promotion or
in service; provide differentiation, which is appreciated by the customer and which does not
jack up the price to an extent not acceptable to the customer. (Providing gold wiring inside a
TV set in place of copper wiring is an extreme example of total opportunity loss with product
differentiation and high pricing.) Customers look for differentiated product as it gives them
satisfaction and ego boosting by making them owners of a product no one else possesses.
<p>2. Low cost of production, which is achieved by economies of scale of manufacture and by ex-
perience curve of the workers who improve the productivity over time and reduce production
rejections. Lowering the cost should never be at the cost of product quality because it could
become counterproductive and the fi rm might lose the entire market. With lower cost of pro-
duction, the fi rm generates cash, which can be utilised in fi rm&rsquo;s growth or at times of severe
price competition in hitting at the competition.
<p>3. Quick response: If a fi rm meets the requirements of the customers fi rst it gains advantage over
other competitive fi rms.
<p>4. Finance: It is mainly used to determine the profi tability of the fi rm, its growth and the economic
value it is adding to itself. Economic value added (EVA) can be seen as the true indicator of
a fi rm&rsquo;s fi nancial health rather than the usual return on investment (ROI).
<p> Economic value added can be arrived at in the following manner:
<p>EVA = Profi t after tax &ndash; (interest on debt + cost of equity capital)
<p> The cost of equity is calculated by taking the average risk-adjusted rate of return, which the
equity or shareholder would get if he invested his money elsewhere. Firms can increase their
EVA by getting lower cost capital or by using less capital.
<p>5. Operations: To analyse a fi rm&rsquo;s operations, the core processes, the product development,
demand management and order fulfi lment processes must be looked into. Firm&rsquo;s need to see
how they can obtain a competitive advantage from these processes.

<p>INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FOR BUSINESS
<p>Introduction
<p>In dealing with different countries it is essential to understand their business environments before
embarking on overseas business. There are cultural differences among nations as well as differences
in economic levels, besides political and legal differences. An understanding of these differences
<p>would help a company plan its strategies for international marketing.
International companies must take into consideration the host country&rsquo;s consumer behaviour pat-
<p>terns. Each country has its special features, market size and buying habits. Large countries have several
societal groupings with specifi c cultural ethos. Companies need to locate groupings which tend to be
more like their home country&rsquo;s groupings. Consumers have their own beliefs, attitudes, perceptions
and preferences. Even within a country there are areas of difference. However, the actual size of the
difference needs to be understood on a real time and place basis. As these groupings get isolated their
culture becomes more uniform.
<p>Culturally equitable groups are formed on the basis of income levels, religion, profession, gender,
age, caste and political leanings. These groupings separate the members into different fi nancial statuses
as well. Besides, these groupings provide the required classifi cations on the basis of earning capacity,
social standings and esteem in society. Workaholism is caused by social pressures, urge for fi nancial
advancement and individual cultural background. Understanding these help companies plan proper
marketing strategies in a given country or a specifi c part thereof. For example, in India, the work-ethic
comes from the basic tenets of the Hindu religion that expects persons to work without expecting good
results for themselves. The obsession to be known as an achiever, a self-actualised person can force
people into performing unbelievable and signifi cantly diffi cult tasks with fortitude and courage.
<p>Each country has its own reward and income enhancing systems that may be totally at variance with
other countries. Occupations offer different norms of income, living standards including individual
lifestyles. Communication between people within groups or with members of other groups is on the
verbal or even non-verbal levels. These sign languages have their own symbols as the cultural trad-
itions provide the backdrop for such understandings. Companies need to become aware of the cultural
nuances of the countries they want to do business with but the degree of information required would
depend on the cultural differences with the home country and the level of market penetration the
company wants to achieve.
<p>Companies get carried away in foreign countries and they station several of their home-country
managers there as they fear that the local managers would not do justice to their efforts and, in fact,
may sabotage the same in favour of local companies. However, becoming totally dependent on the
local managers is not the answer. Companies should look for the best talents for the job, even if they
have to go to a third country to recruit such a person.
<p>Companies tend to adopt practices from more successful economies. However, countries with
successful economies could have a totally different culture. It may be a good idea to adopt certain
cultural factors of the host country, especially their language. However, no compromise should be
made on the basic value system of the home country.
<p>Besides the country&rsquo;s culture, it is essential for companies to know the basis of operating with
the host country&rsquo;s government, its fi nancial institutions, environment groups and consumer forums.
A country&rsquo;s political system, its political ideology, its religion, or its fundamentalist way of functioning
that derives its strength from its religious fervour need to be studied before entering the country. </p>
<br>
</div>

<p>International Marketing Management162
<p>However, a good political system assures unity and coherence amidst the chaos of differing thought
processes.
<p>There are great differences between the political and legal systems of countries, and multinational
corporations (MNCs) have to formulate and implement their strategies taking these differences into
account. The role of the political system is to be the cohesive force in society. The two opposing systems
on the political horizons are democracy, in which people participate in the running of the government,
and totalitarianism, where a group of people or even one person wields all the political power. In a dem-
ocracy, citizens enjoy widespread freedom, especially in the areas of political rights and civil liberties.
Different governments have different approaches to business and the stability of governments varies
across countries. Managers must have the foresight to infl uence and respond to government action and
any stimuli provided by it. Managers must also learn the ethically correct behaviour and operations
for each country they operate in. At times the law may not provide the guidelines in this regard.
<p>There are several types of economies in the world, with many differences between them. These
differences affect management decisions in a signifi cant manner. In a market economy, individuals
have the power to allocate control and distribute economic resources through their actions. This is
not true of planned economies. However, in the twenty-fi rst century, most countries are headed to-
wards market-driven economy and are succeeding in reaching there in varying degrees and these
imbalances provide challenges to the international business manager of today. Key factors that
infl uence the decision-making process for MNCs are the host country&rsquo;s economic growth, its policy
on privatisation, infl ation, balance of payment between countries and external debt.
<p>Countries with high growth rates in their economy are able to exploit these human and natural
resources most effi ciently. On the other hand, developing nations like India provide large market
potential (especially since the markets of the West are saturated with products and largely have
replacement markets). These countries are showing strong economic growth. Investing in them
would help in further developing the market, notwithstanding the risk factor involved due to pol-
itical instability in some countries.
<p>Let us discuss economic differences and the ways of dealing with them.
<p>Economic Business Environment
<p>India became independent in 1947 and the government of the day, with Jawahar Lal Nehru as the
fi rst prime minister of India, decided that the country would adopt a socialistic pattern of society,
with major economic developments to be in the hands of the government. The birth of the public
sector undertakings took place with a number of fi rms like Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, Hindustan
Machine Tools and Hindustan Steels coming into existence. The private sector was considered to
comprise unscrupulous people who wanted to cheat the government and the public. This resulted
in the permit/license raj, where the government bureaucracy started doling out favours in return for
monetary gains. The public sector suffered from the lack of accountability and undue interference from
the political bosses. Bribery and corruption became so rampant that it is today a hydra-like monster,
raising its head higher each day.
<p>However, the realisation that the country cannot live in isolation came in 1991, and the government
had to open up its economy. Internationally, two major changes had taken place. First was the collapse
of the USSR, which resulted in the dismantling of communism across most parts of the world. At the
same time, the other major communist power, China, started going the capitalistic way in no mean </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 163
<p>measure. Cuba is the only country that has held on to communism in its entirety. Till the mid-twentieth
century, there were two major economic ideologies: the American market-based economy and the
state-controlled economy of the communist regimes. And then there was the third type, the mixed
economy, which was practised in India among a few other nations. Mixed economy was meant to
give equal impetus to government and private enterprise. With this ideology, a new corporate sector
was born, the joint sector, where both the private and the government were fi nanciers of the project.
Joint sector enterprises were started in order to get government approvals quickly and then run the
organisation on the lines of a private venture. However, the confl icting decisions by both the owners
and tight government audit never allowed it to fl ourish as an economic force in the country.
<p>Futuristic Global Marketing
<p>In the fi rst quarter of the twenty-fi rst century, international fi rms appear to be in disarray, due to the
sudden and frequent changes in the general and competitive international environment. What is the
mantra that would help fi rms sustain themselves in the future?
<p>The long-term profi t and growth of a fi rm depends primarily on the knowledge, ability and com-
mitment of its employees and its relationship with investors, customers and other stakeholders. Let
us fi rst understand the stakeholders of a fi rm (see Figure 6.1):
<p>Figure 6.1 Company&rsquo;s Stakeholders
<p>It can be seen that fi rms that are run in the future in the interest of the wide range of all the stake-
holders of the fi rm are more likely to behave responsibly towards their own interest as well and only
that would be their survival kit. Such fi rms would be carrying on their business according to the laws
of the land, laws of the society and adhering to certain ethical values.
<p>Firms need to plan their objectives in two ways, one for commercial success and another for being
a good corporate citizen. From the history of really successful fi rms it can be seen that they have not
fl aunted any law of the land and have paid their taxes in time and in full. The following points need
special attention in this regard:
<p>1. If an individual or a fi rm is amassing wealth without effort then they will never be able to enjoy
the wealth.
<p>2. Playing politics without principles will not take a politician far in the game of politics.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management164
<p>3. People who acquire knowledge and skills without remaining moral usually cannot benefi t from
their knowledge and skills.
<p>Social and commercial values together reinforce a fi rm&rsquo;s stability and it leads to greater loyalty
towards stakeholders and greater corporate resilience. For example, tobacco companies show young
boys and girls enjoying a picnic and smoking cigarettes in their advertisements. Alcohol companies
advertise people having a great time with a glass of whiskey. A fi rm must look at its priorities in the
following manner (see Figure 6.2):
<p>Figure 6.2 Priorities in Business for a Firm
<p>Benefi ts accrue to a fi rm from total transparency with regard to social, environmental and ethical
issues. One question which keeps coming to people&rsquo;s mind is: &lsquo;is it acceptable to use unethical means
to achieve perfectly legitimate goals?&rsquo; the proverbial speed money syndrome. Seeing the number of
persons from notable fi rms behind the bars should be enough deterrent in this regard.
<p>It must be clearly understood that in this century, fi rms that include their stakeholders in their
decision-making process will outperform fi rms that do not. As a metaphor, stakeholders can be con-
sidered the spokes of a wheel, that is the fi rm, and it can be seen that all the spokes of a wheel are equally
important. Alternately, fi rms looking only at stockholders remain focused on themselves and they
generate dysfunctional and unsustainable imbalance in the fi rm.
<p>Low-cost labour creates disparity in incomes, which can only bring disquiet and trouble to rich
nations and the sooner the disparities are removed, the better it is for all fi rms globally. Rich nations
buy from poor nations with low labour cost, thus derailing the situation of their own labour class;
with the limited buying power of poor nations, the rich nations cannot sell their high cost products to
the poor nations. The fi rst step can be taken when the decisions are taken from the stakeholders&rsquo;
viewpoint along with the view of stockholders.
<p>CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY
<p>A capitalistic society starts with free enterprise as the guiding economic principle of business. Given the
fact that there is a quota system in the US for imports and other tariff or specifi cation-based barriers,
free enterprise can hardly be considered free. These measures are there not to denounce the system but
to place some relevant safeguards against the big becoming bigger and the small remaining small.
<p>The current stockholder fi rst free market system is not delivering a just and sustainable future for
the next millennium. Some players are winning at the cost of others. Competition should be on a
level-playing fi eld where all the players are in agreement. Have you ever seen a normal race with
some athletes standing ahead of others? This problem has created a universal crisis of confi dence in
business as an institution.
<p>Adam Smith in the seventeenth century in his The Wealth of Nations said, &lsquo;rules of free enterprise
are not applied in their pure form in any market economy on earth. The rules of free enterprise
completely understate the human and social dimensions.&rsquo; This appears to be as true today as it was
in the seventeenth century.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 165
<p>Globalisation of the economy may bring the best for customers through international competition,
but it is not an unmixed blessing. It could kill the local economy, social and cultural norms of the na-
tions and their religious ethos as well. The pub culture, disco mania, which was the waterloo of the
Japanese youth in the 1990s, are taking hold of our youth today and see how Japan suffered when those
young people took over the reins of business later. One can, but imagine the Indian scene 10 years
hence. Can there be unbridled economic prosperity?
<p>The irony of the situation can be seen from the fact that while business espouses free trade it has
a tendency to try to gain market dominance and monopoly through mergers and acquisitions, and
there is just about nobody to stem the rot, not even the mighty World Trade Organization (WTO), as
it is controlled by the fi rms behind the mergers. The WTO is able to pull up the smaller players in the
fi eld: &lsquo;Your specifi cations do not match. Do you know the source of milk you want to sell? Which cow
or buffalo gave the milk for the supply on the 1 January 2001, batch 21140 from Jullunder India?&rsquo;
<p>Four hundred and forty-eight individuals have 40 per cent of the world&rsquo;s wealth. The intention is
not to have a closed socialistic economy of the erstwhile USSR, but to fi nd solutions within the free
economy framework for a more just economic order. This calls for working out globally accepted
business ethics. Pharmacy fi rms like GlaxoSmith Kline Beecham spend US$ 1 billion each year for the
eradication of diseases from the world. Firms have education, health and forestation programmes as
a service to the community, one of their stakeholders. Each stakeholder is like the spoke in a wheel
and all the spokes are equally important for the wheel to move smoothly.
<p>Free market economy and the connected business organisations only worry about profi ts. Profi t
as a motive of a fi rm is not wrong. However, usually, the CEO of a fi rm is worried only about the
bottom line and that is not so good. A multiple bottom line, which considers the social, environmental
and ethical issues, gives a long-term correct profi t picture of the fi rm. Hence, the CEO should work
towards the total picture and not just profi ts if a fi rm is looking at sustainable profi ts and growth.
<p>CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
<p>In the context of marketing, a corporation must move forward keeping in view the totality of the
stakeholders&rsquo; interests. It is possible to arrange two type of audits&mdash;fi nancial audits and social audits,
which include environmental audits. These would automatically change the ethical and morality norms
of a fi rm. Capitalism has encouraged the individualistic pursuit of excellence. This individualism has
given them the impetus to strive for self-centred success at the expense of the environment. However,
today&rsquo;s managers are increasingly recognising the value of teamwork and encouraging individual
excellence while getting everyone to be part of the team. The answer lies in having a happy combination
of the two where individuals remain good team members and yet their excellence is rewarded.
<p>Increasingly, stakeholders&rsquo; value is the overriding obligation of fi rms. However, Adam Smith&rsquo;s
&lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; has so far failed to create a radical wealth balance. The company that ignores the
stakeholders&rsquo; values or their expectations from the company is invariably going to fail because if, for
example, it pollutes the air, water or soil, the ecology of the place will get disturbed, creating huge
problems that will sooner or later spoil the company&rsquo;s image and its business as a result. Adam
Smith had propounded that a country&rsquo;s absolute advantage is the only requirement in creating
wealth. In today&rsquo;s world, this does not happen due to multifarious reasons including political, social
and historical factors. Adam Smith did not speak of company&rsquo;s stakeholders at all. While business
people are normally good, they work within an economic framework, which rewards them for their
short-term and autocratic behaviour. It is the business objective, which needs redefi ning to include
the stakeholders.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management166
<p>Marketing decisions taken without consulting the customer groups and the marketing employees
in the fi eld will not be conducive to long-term sustainable growth. In a conventional business, the
employees are considered as appendages to the management. The customers are the target markets
and once the fi rm listens to its customers and its employees, the management will be able to take far
more accurate decisions.
<p>The fi rms in business today are for the future generations and they must plan to leave the planet
a better place to live in than what it is today. The next generation will reap what the fi rm is sowing
today.
<p>RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS
<p>Chief executive offi cers, banks, fi nancers and customers are competing for the scarce resources of the
planet for a win&ndash;lose scenario. However, they end up in a lose&ndash;lose situation in terms of sustainabil-
ity of their operations. The fact that so many fi rms come and go is ample proof of this theory. In a
stakeholder-managed fi rm, the resources are evenly divided amongst connecting groups to create
a win&ndash;win situation.
<p>For achieving the win&ndash;win situation, the stakeholders, CEOs and employees must participate in
the management decisions. Their intents must be aligned at the corporate and individual levels in
order to best arrange what the customer wants and provide him with not just satisfaction but delight.
This is true for other stakeholders as well. The age-old difference between managers and workers,
that of thinkers and doers, must vanish as today&rsquo;s worker is also a thinker and being a person on the
spot can give valuable suggestions.
<p>GLOBAL MARKETS
<p>The governance of business must create greater accountability, stakeholders&rsquo; representation on the
board of management, professionalism, ethical standards and knowledge of international markets
for obtaining their niche place in the global market.
<p>QUALITY AND QUANTITY AUDIT
<p>Stakeholder management should be equipped for benchmarking performance and for conducting
related audit checks with quality indicators and also stakeholders&rsquo; perceptions. Success will increas-
ingly depend on benchmarking and auditing performance and it will help create an authentic and
effective stakeholder corporation.
<p>SAFETY NORMS
<p>Modern self-looking fi rms abuse health and safety norms, both for their employees and for customers.
Stakeholder fi rms nurture customers by providing them safe products, and the employees by creating </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 167
<p>a safe working environment. This builds a loyal and profi table partnership with both the stakeholders.
Today these have become culturally important element of day-to-day management.
<p>ADVERTISING
<p>Through ubiquitous and manipulative, advertising, in some cases, is the imposition of a fi rm&rsquo;s cultural
ethos not only in one country but also worldwide, which at times undermines the genuine needs of
the customers. Customers&rsquo; participation would, in fact, help them in retaining their market share on
a long-term basis.
<p>EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS
<p>If the workplace remains a dangerous place and the customers are the exploited lot, the fi rm cannot
have long-term profi t and growth. A sustainable stakeholder corporation proactively creates a caring
workplace and fosters dialogical mutually nurturing relationship with the customers. Developing
seamless relationship with suppliers and other business partners like fi nancers manifests in market
power, operational innovation effi ciency and wealth creation. Today, the traditional distance between
fi rms and suppliers as business partners should increasingly disappear. We are in the era of mutual
trust and transparency, where the suppliers, manufacturers and retailers are all suppliers of goods
as a major part of their operations.
<p>QUALITY
<p>Quality is not some predetermined set of physical criteria only. It is a refl ection of products and
processes, which satisfy and, ideally, delight the customer&rsquo;s needs and desires. These needs and de-
sires in turn may be economic, social, physiological or psychological. The stakeholder fi rm expands
its web of economic relational intimacy by incorporating in their plans the needs of the customers,
suppliers and other business partners.
<p>The management of corporations through political pressure, public relation campaigns and fi nan-
cial power often becomes unscrupulous and selfi shly manipulative towards society for their narrow
benefi ts. The management&rsquo;s enlightened self-interest leads to greater chances of bigger profi ts,
sustainable development and good governance in the future.
<p>COMMUNITIES
<p>Firms that maintain the involvement and support of the communities they exist in help create a
vibrant local economy from which they inevitably derive benefi ts, moving beyond the &lsquo;big brother&rsquo;s
help&rsquo; syndrome. Social cause systems built in the fi rm in a transparent manner are the key factors
of fully engaging communities. The social causes as exemplifi ed by TISCO are the best form of PR
exercises and powerful advertising. The cause should be genuinely altruistic and not just an eyewash. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management168
<p>The more money you make the larger should be the share given to the community and the opposite
is also true. Partnerships between communities, the business and the government are going to
be the most important drivers of wealth creation, sustainable development and good governance
in the future. Firms resist governmental regulations and public opinion and try to reshape com-
munities and societies to improve their bottom line. However, powerful self-interest corrodes the
profi tability and sustainability of the fi rm.
<p>THE ENVIRONMENT
<p>The state of our major rivers, mountainsides denuded for timber and limestone have changed the
country&rsquo;s climate for the worse. In the Dehradun area, limestone quarrying was carried out till
the entire mountain became bald and brown and the Sahasra dhara (thousand springs in the river)
went dry. It was only after massive public opinion against it that quarrying was stopped and soon
enough the thousand springs burst forth again to make it a beautiful, scenic place again. Chemical
plants, paper mills and other factories pollute the water and air continuously, day and night. The
environmental initiatives taken by some fi rms are merely an eye-wash and are dangerous because
they cause more harm than good. As corporate citizens they must develop a genuine concern for
the state of our country&rsquo;s ecology and that of the planet.
<p>Firms surely benefi t from a clean environment. By making a positive contribution towards the
environment, they are able to enhance the reputation of the fi rm with the stakeholders, which leads to
improved morale of the employees and greater loyalty from them. Environmentally-friendly initiatives
also help companies in saving costs on energy and raw materials and contribute to higher effi ciency
and productivity. They often lead to greater market opportunities. All these factors contribute to a
fi rm&rsquo;s success.
<p>In conclusion it can be said that the writing is on the wall and the sooner fi rms notice it the better it
is for them. In the twenty-fi rst century, unless the fi rm is stakeholder savvy, responsive to their views
and incorporates them in its decision-making process, they could be seeing a receding bottom line.
<p>Recent Changes in the International Business Environment
in Relation to the WTO
<p>Although the path of world trade growth has been uneven in the past few years, the fact that trade
continued to expand faster than output is indicative of the increasing openness of national economies.
Part of this development is due to the gradual but continued trend towards more liberal trade pol-
icies around the world. This is a tribute to the good sense of governments in conducting their trade
policies. But credit also goes to the strength of the multilateral rules under the WTO, as well as com-
mitments made under regional trade arrangements. Members of the WTO need to build on these
achievements and put in place a comprehensive work programme to strengthen further the multilateral
trading system.
<p>National trade policies have continued, by and large, to be outward-oriented, through the im-
plementation of multilateral and regional commitments and new liberalising initiatives&mdash;multilateral,
regional and autonomous. Since the establishment of the WTO in 1995, members have been </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 169
<p>implementing staged reductions in bound tariffs, in domestic levels of support and export subsidy
levels for agricultural products and lifting non-tariff barriers. Specifi c measures, targeted on improving
market access for least-developed countries in particular, have also been implemented. At the same
time, with a view to improving the transparency, stability and openness of their trading environments,
a number of WTO members have been changing the procedural aspects of their trade policy regimes,
particularly with respect to licensing and customs valuation. These efforts have resulted, without
doubt, in more open markets, on the whole.
<p>In agriculture, an important achievement was the conversion of all non-tariff measures to tariff
measures and the binding of 100 per cent of all tariffs on agricultural products by all WTO members,
improving predictability and security of access. However, the resulting tariffs are high and continue
to offer signifi cant protection to the products concerned.
<p>PRODUCT REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS ARE A GROWING ISSUE
FOR MARKET ACCESS
<p>Products placed on the markets of WTO members, whether domestic or imported, must comply with
the relevant regulations. Such regulations may include sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS),
which are taken to protect human, animal or plant health, or other product regulations and standards,
such as labelling and packaging requirements, to meet public policy objectives. Generally, the entry
of imported products is permitted subject to conformity assessment procedures conducted on
the territory of the destination market. However, sometimes the measures involve outright bans. The
WTO Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures
(SPS) recognise and encourage the activities at the international level designed to reduce barriers
to trade resulting from products and products-related regulation, in particular, the development of
international standards, guidelines and recommendations. Such activities at the international level
reduce the potential barriers to exports.
<p>The SPS Agreement encourages the acceptance, by an importing country, of health protection
measures that may differ from those of the importing country but that provide an equivalent level
of safety. The SPS Committee has identifi ed actions that could assist developing countries that are
seeking to have their measures recognised as equivalent.
<p>The SPS and TBT measures are an integral part of the instruments at the disposal of WTO members
to meet public policy goals: an objective of the relevant WTO agreements is to ensure that such meas-
ures do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade.
<p>MARKET ACCESS CONDITIONS FOR SERVICES
<p>The services sector plays a dominant role in the economies of most WTO members, both in providing
consumer benefi ts directly, such as through health and education, and as a support to business activ-
ities through, for example, fi nance, communications and transportation. Services are the main sector of
activity in high-income countries (both in terms of GDP and employment) and its importance is growing
in lower-income countries. The importance of the services sector in the world economy greatly exceeds
its share in world trade, the latter being estimated at one-fi fth in 2000, in part because these statistics
only count cross-border transactions and not services provided through affi liates. Effi ciency in the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management170
<p>production and trade of services has an important bearing on economic performance and development.
Services like transportation and distribution, banking and fi nance are of critical importance in
developing countries (and no less in developed countries), both for the emergence of a competitive
manufacturing sector and, more broadly, for social development and poverty reduction. In many of
the poorest countries, economic and social development is hampered by the lack of adequate basic
infrastructure such as roads, power supply, telecommunications and public transport. Open services
trade regimes may therefore entail major benefi ts by helping poor countries to obtain infrastructural
services at internationally competitive prices. For those reasons, similar basic policy prescriptions as
in the goods sector apply, such as ensuring that policies encourage rather than impede competition,
and that economic operators have some certainty regarding the stability of the policy framework.
In addition to domestic benefi ts from a greater variety and competitive pricing of services, trading
partners gain the opportunity for trade-related development, based on services trade.
<p>A key development in the multilateral trading system was the WTO GATTS Agreement, which
established a framework of commitments by members to bind, reduce or eliminate impediments to
the supply of services by foreign providers; this was followed up by the agreements on basic telecom-
munications and fi nancial services in 1997. Just as is the case of the policies affecting market access for
goods, members have adopted a wide variety of approaches to service-sector liberalisation.
<p>In relation to this, a number of members have pursued privatisation and deregulation of services
activities, accelerating the pace of autonomous liberalisation in the services sector and leading to policies
in place that are generally more liberal. Since the mid-1990s, a wave of restructuring, rationalisation
and privatisation of key services has been undertaken in many developing countries, particularly in
the areas of telecommunications, fi nance and transportation.
<p>Among the underlying factors were the rapid rate of technological change (for example, in tele-
communications), fi nancial crises and the need to redress ailing banking sectors, the restructuring of
public sectors, supply bottlenecks (public transport, energy) as well as fi scal considerations. Foreign
participation has often been encouraged by the WTO to provide capital, transfer of technology and
entrepreneurial methods. Faced with the rapid globalisation of markets and technologies and changing
consumer demands, service reforms have also been undertaken by developed countries, in particular
in &lsquo;network industries&rsquo; (telecommunications, power and gas supply).
<p>The trade policy reviews conducted since the establishment of the WTO in 1995 provide numer-
ous examples of domestic reforms undertaken in both developed and developing countries. For
example, the fi nancial crisis in South-east Asia (1997&ndash;98) provided for extensive opening to foreign
participation in banking (Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Thailand), other fi nancial services (Republic
of Korea), telecommunications (Republic of Korea, Thailand) and distribution services (Indonesia).
Wide-ranging liberalisation of service sectors had the objective to increase economic effi ciency and
resilience in key services as well as to attract foreign expertise. The lowering of foreign ownership
thresholds in Indonesia, Republic of Korea and Thailand allowed foreign banks to take effective control
of ailing domestic institutions and facilitate restructuring. In addition, the lifting of branch restrictions
(Indonesia) aimed at creating a level-playing fi eld throughout the country, as foreign institutions had
initially been confi ned to selected urban regions. In Brazil, the structural reform agenda in services
covers the privatisation of state-owned banks, the national telephone company and the leasing of
port, airports and highways.
<p>Similar to this, many countries in Africa have taken similar steps (Gabon, Kenya and Uganda),
seeking foreign strategic partners for major banks or telecommunications companies. Reforms are
undertaken on an autonomous basis, often under International Monetary Fund and World Bank-
supported programmes.</p>

<p>REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS
<p>The main aim of the WTO is non-discrimination due to which WTO allows members to conclude
customs unions and free-trade areas. With virtually all WTO members being partners in at least one
regional trade agreement (RTA) and with several being part of two or more, RTAs have become by
far the most important element in several trade agreements.
<p>A major development in 2001 was the formal launch of negotiations on a Free-Trade Agreement
of the Americas (FTAA), linking partners in North and South America. Other cross-regional trade
integration initiatives are also making progress, notably the negotiations on free-trade agreements
between the European Union (EU), on the one hand, and Chile and Mercosur, respectively, on the
other hand.
<p>Another major development is the rising number of RTAs in Asia, the region with the smallest
number of RTAs currently in force, including by Japan, still among the few WTO members not party
to one or more RTAs.
<p>Although RTAs may take the form of free-trade areas (FTAs), customs unions (CUs), or agreements
leading to the formation of one or the other, free-trade areas are generally more prevalent than CUs.
Free-trade areas account for almost 90 per cent of all RTAs.
<p>In Europe, the liberalisation provisions of most of the FTAs between the EU and candidates
to accession have been implemented and further liberalisation has been agreed for agricultural
products.
<p>A similar process is envisaged for African, Caribbean and Pacifi c countries. The EU is also looking
to forge closer ties with emerging markets in Latin America. In Africa, the regional integration process
continues to intensify. Ambitious plans to achieve a FTA among 20 countries in eastern and southern
Africa, supported by closer monetary cooperation, are under way.
<p>In Asia, Japan has shifted its long-standing policy of multilateral-only trade liberalisation to sign
an FTA with Singapore in 2001.
<p>In the rest of the world, regional initiatives have been burgeoning, from the Middle-East to Eastern
Europe and South Asia agreement between India and Sri Lanka and the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), involving both WTO members and non-members.
<p>Still, the evidence regarding the stock of completed RTAs and the large number of RTAs planned
or under negotiation is testimony to the basic attraction of such agreements to virtually all WTO
members. Regional trade agreements can offer intermediate steps to the broader process of integra-
tion into the world economy and, in some cases, achieve faster and deeper liberalisation than is possible
at the multilateral level. Some countries argue that liberalisation at the regional level is sometimes
a prerequisite to achieving multilateral consensus. Other countries view trade agreements as part of a
wider integration projects, aimed at stimulating economic, social and political links in their regions;
this is notably the case for small or landlocked African states, which typically seek integration of
infrastructures and monetary unions. In this context, the exchange of trade preferences is but an initial
aspect of a much broader and deeper integration agenda. Regional trade agreements have their limits.
Experience has also shown that 100 per cent product coverage of free-trade provisions is the exception
as opposed to the rule, as the domestic forces that resist trade liberalisation at the multilateral level
are just as likely to resist it at the regional level, perhaps even more so given proximity. And FTA
partners do not generally exempt each other from using trade defence instruments, which are a frequent
source of dispute in the WTO, but also regionally. For third parties, RTAs imply trade diversion as a
result of tariff preferences, reinforced by preferential rules of origin.</p>

<p>International Marketing Game 6.1
<p>Students should learn Mackenzie&rsquo;s Seven S Model and use it in the game as follows:
The best way to look at the imperative of improving performance is through Mackenzie&rsquo;s Seven
S Model (see Figure 6.3):
<p>Figure 6.3 Mackenzie&rsquo;s Seven S Model
<p>The model has shared vision at the centre and the other remarkable thing about it is that each of
the Seven S is interconnected with no hierarchy between them. Shared vision or the super ordinate
goals are of higher order, which go beyond profi t, return on investment (ROI), growth and similar
economic or fi nancial measures. There are certain guiding concepts&mdash;a set of values and aspirations
often unwritten, that go beyond conventional formal statements of quantifi ed corporate goals and
objectives.
<p>Mahatma Gandhi&rsquo;s vision was of India with its heart in the villages, as he believed that unless
the villages prospered India could not become prosperous. J.R.D. Tata&rsquo;a vision for India was that
of an industrially-developed nation. Dabur&rsquo;s vision is an Ayurvedic resurrection in India.
<p>Seven S Model
1. Strategy is a set of actions, plans and policies aimed at obtaining sustainable competitive
<p>advantage for the fi rm.
2. Structures show the fi rms reporting line up, the organisation chart, functional divisions and
<p>their integration.
3. System gives the fl ow chart of operations, the processes, quality control system, manufacturing
<p>process, information system.
4. Style shows the working philosophy, time management and behaviour with seniors, juniors
<p>and the peer group by the personnel of the fi rm, where the leader shows the way and others
emulate the leader.
<p>5. Staff determines the career growth plan of the employees, training patterns and honing of
their intrinsic values.
<p>6. Skills are the capabilities of the combined set of people in the fi rm.
7. Shared vision (discussed earlier).
<p>In this management game the students should analyse the different aspects of the Seven S Model
for a given company and organise its success story around these factors.</p>

<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 173
<p>INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER, COMPETITION AND
MARKETING CONTROLS
<p>In the competitive fi eld, fi rms have to keep looking at the customers to know their mindsets, changes
in demographic profi les of the customers and increase or decrease of demand in the market segment,
which the fi rm is targeting. Marketing plans are made on the basis of these factors and market dynamics.
The best of plans can become useless unless they are implemented in the correct manner and are kept
on the rolling mode, that is, with the facility to alter the plan with speed and effi ciency. It is unwise to
ignore or underestimate the competition as it is unwise to plan without information about the market,
which must form the bedrock for market planning, as discussed next.
<p>International Market Information System
<p>Selling without knowing the market situation is like shooting in the dark and is as useless too. Most
fi rms keep track of what is happening in the market place with the help of their fi eld force. The fi eld
salesmen are known as the eyes and ears of a fi rm. Moving in the market, meeting channel members,
who carry competitive products as well, a sharp salesman can fi nd out the moves being planned by
the competition. Firms must structure the information gathering process to make it really effective
and synchronous between the salesmen. In case the information collected by different salespersons
varies, it will be diffi cult to make any conclusions from it and hence take any decisive action. The
structure of information will depend on the product range, customer segmentation and distribution
channels. The use of computers, networking and access to computers available to the decision-makers
and the fi eld force will make the market information system (MIS) useful.
<p>Information for MIS is required in the following areas:
<p>1. Changes in the general environment factors, that is, demographic, socio-cultural, political-legal,
technological, macroeconomic and global factors.
<p>2. Changes in competitive environment factors, that is, rivalry amongst existing players, threat of
new entrants, threat of substitute products, bargaining power of buyers and bargaining power
of suppliers.
<p>3. New distribution channels.
4. Price changes by the competition.
5. New product plans by the competition.
<p>International competitive information gathering by devious means is called industrial or market
espionage and should be avoided. At times, competitive sales people are themselves happy to boast
about their fi rm&rsquo;s plans. The wisdom is in letting the competitive salesman know the trivia about the
fi rm couched in a language impressive enough to look like a major information leak. In exchange
the fi rm can draw out vital information from the competition&rsquo;s salesman. Market information system
is basic information and it should not be confused with marketing research.
<p>For collecting useful MIS, the following are required:
<p>1. People, who are locals living in the host country rather than people from the home country.
2. Procedure for gathering the information.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management174
<p>3. Equipment, like computers.
4. Analysis and evaluation of the information.
5. Making the information available to concerned people, the decision-makers through access to
<p>computer networking.
<p>Imminence of need of information and its recency are two important factors.
The present ordering scenario on the internet is given in Figure 6.4:
<p>Figure 6.4 Ordering on the Internet
<p>Recency is a word used in market research that shows the age of the data&mdash;is it recent enough and
can be used or is it outdated and should be discarded. A lot of MIS is available in a fi rm&rsquo;s records and
it only needs to be put into usable order. It starts with the following forms generated in the fi rm:
<p>1. Acknowledgement of customers, the channel members, host country&rsquo;s company offi ce or
business-to-business orders received by the fi rm.
<p>2. The marketing department&rsquo;s order to dispatch the goods to the warehouse or production unit,
depending on whether the product is always ready for dispatch or is made to order.
<p>3. The warehouse&rsquo; shipping bill, with particulars of goods dispatched.
4. The accounts department&rsquo;s invoice to the customer.
5. The customer&rsquo;s advice to its bank to release payment for goods acquired from the fi rm.
6. Increasingly customers are turning to the internet. Transactions over the internet are usually
<p>speedy&mdash;customers are happy to receive their product quickly and companies get their money
quickly.
<p>7. Computers help in inventory controls and in updating the position of stocks on a day-to-
day basis.
<p>8. Current inventory positions help in booking orders by giving realistic delivery schedules to
the customers.
<p>A country-wise inventory register on the computer would look like Table 6.1. A multi-product
sales register on the computer for Dealer X of a particular country would look like Table 6.2.
<p>The data would help in estimating the reordering time taking the transit time average from the
manufacturing unit to the warehouse. The information can be kept for more than two years as it gives
a good comparison of sales drops or pickups in any given comparable period.
<p>If the dealer is selling competitive products as well, similar statistics could be procured for the
competition and kept as guidelines about the dealer, his selling capacity and loyalty towards the fi rm.
An important area of marketing is the collection of outstanding dues from the dealers/customers and
salesmen need to have updated knowledge of these details at their fi ngertips. The salesmen must
know the status of complaints received from the customers, as unless most of the complaints have
been settled to the entire satisfaction of the customer, the salesmen would be wasting their time and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 175
<p>that of the customer if they visit the customers. Chances are that they will not be even welcome at
the customer&rsquo;s premises. The salesmen therefore need the registers as shown in Table 6.3 on the data
bank of their computers.
<p>Table 6.3 Outstanding Payment Register
<p>Dealer/Customer
Outstanding dues
<p>less than a month old
Between a month
&lt; three month old
<p>Between three&ndash;six

<p>
<p>The complaint register should look like Table 6.4:

<p>
<p>With the help of computer networking, the following information can be available to the salesman
on his laptop, before he plans sales calls on his customers:
<p>1. Latest price lists with available discounts.
2. Customisation possibilities (with the required timeframe) of the product.
3. Product confi gurations available.
4. The supply position of previous orders and for fresh orders.
5. Error correction needed in previous orders, if any.

<p>6. Position regarding customer complaints.
7. Product uncommitted inventories for ease of giving delivery schedules for fresh orders.
<p>International buyers can thus get the online information and defi nite commitment regarding
supply positions.
<p>Once the orders are received by the salesmen they can email it to several locations like the marketing
department, inventory manager and production unit, dispatch wing at the same time to save postal
delays and for improving the delivery time to the customers. Online communication and interaction
helps in avoiding last-minute glitches in the system.
<p>Information or data required to build the MIS must be tuned to decision-making only because data
for the sake of having data serves no purpose, occupies computer space and becomes a time-wasting
exercise only. In order to justify MIS data, the following must be kept in mind:
<p>1. Does the fi rm need dealer support in building its MIS?
2. Would dealers&rsquo; invoices giving details of their retail customers suffi ce?
3. Decisions needed to be taken.
4. The frequency of the decisions.
5. Data required for taking the decisions.
6. Frequency of data need.
7. Any periodic or even sporadic special report required for taking decisions.
8. The type of data analysis required.
9. Does the fi rm need a built-in MIS improvement system? If yes, then of what type?
<p>For obtaining competitive information the following can be done by fi rms:
<p>1. Ask the dealers selling competing products.
2. Use mystery shoppers at competitor&rsquo;s showrooms.
3. Use third-party buyers at the competitor&rsquo;s showrooms.
4. Buy competitive products.
5. Consumer panels can be set up with members buying the products of the fi rm and its competition,
<p>for example, at kitty parties.
6. Get information from suppliers of raw materials who could be common to the fi rm and its
<p>competitors.
7. Set-up a database group for continuous monitoring of the internet for competitive information.
<p>INTERACTIVE PROJECT FOR THE CLASS
<p>Suggested Topics for Group Report
Company studies: These topics involve field interviews and correspondence combined with
documentary sources. Students have to make full use of libraries of institutes, the US Library and the
British Council Library.
<p>1. A global marketing audit: Design a marketing audit that a company can use to determine where
it is in the Keegan typology of stages of development of the global corporation and what it
should do with the information. (The Keegan typology of global corporation analyses its ability </p>

<p>for creation of world standard products, its cross-cultural strength and its effectiveness in global
markets.
<p>2. Make report analysing the global marketing strategies of companies.
3. Global product management: Under what circumstances have companies integrated their
<p>domestic and foreign product planning and management? What factors have led to this inte-
gration? What are the explicit and hidden costs and benefi ts?
<p>4. Global marketing transfers: How do companies manage the transfer of marketing experience
internationally?
<p>5. International marketing data analysis: Make an analysis of published data with implications
for management.
<p>6. Global market performance analysis: Economic and social data combined with company sales,
earnings and expenditure data and judgemental measures of competition could be used to
measure and evaluate market performance in different countries.
<p>Topic Reports
1. Marketing in Japan, India, US, Europe, China, etc. Secondary sources and personal interviews.
<p>If you do this type of report, make sure that your report has practical implications for marketing
managers.
<p>2. Export pricing policies. Examine the export pricing method used by a company or group of
companies and make recommendations for improvements. Explain why you recommended
these changes.
<p>3. Pricing strategy in multinational corporations for infl ationary markets.
4. How can Indian programmers solve software problems in the US while the Americans are
<p>sleeping? Make a proposal to an American software company (for example, Microsoft) to
engage software professionals in Bangalore to fi nd time-sensitive solutions at a competitive
rate, making use of the difference in time zones and pay scales.
<p>5. Using the internet to scan and search for international business opportunities. This can be a com-
pany study or a report. Ideally students can do their research on the internet, interview company
representatives who have used the internet to expand internationally.
<p>6. Creating equidistance in viewing the customer. Suggest a strategy by which international com-
petitors can be close to the customer whether the customer is located 5 km away or 10,000 km
away.
<p>7. An original research project that fulfi ls the requirement of international marketing and involves
both primary and secondary research and is doable in two weeks.
<p>Note: As soon as the project is agreed by the group, a proposal should be written down and approval must be
given by the faculty who will question the students and make sure that the project can be achieved.
<p>Task for Students
Defi ne the data needed by an FMCG fi rm for taking marketing decisions and also discuss how the
fi rm should go about collecting and using it?

<p>MARKET PLAN IMPLEMENTATION
<p>Firms need to implement their marketing plans in the following manner:
<p>1. Convert marketing plans in to action tasks and procedures.
2. Convey the fi rm&rsquo;s objective, which drives the plan to the marketing team and obtain full
<p>commitment of all members on the objectives.
3. Give suffi cient authority for implementing the plan.
4. Assign marketing team members with the tasks, both individually and as a team.
5. Monitor the progress of the implementation process through unobtrusive check points.
6. Get the team&rsquo;s commitment on the time needed for implementation.
<p>Firms need to quickly evaluate the causes of losing their grip on the market as seen by loss in
sales, to assess the reason for failure. Is it the plan&rsquo;s failure or that of the people implementing the
plan? Have the people assigning the implementation to the team gone wrong or is the fault of
the set objectives or that the team has faltered? The other causes of failure could be incorrect budget
allocations for the implementation, ineffective training given to the team members or limitations
of coordination between the team members, which could be due to ignorance or ego problems of
some of the members. A fi rm&rsquo;s management must be aware of the process of evaluating the effectiveness
of the plan implementation process.
<p>Most implementation problems arise because of lack of clarity in setting up the marketing goals
and objectives and the provision of tools for evaluating the success of the plan. Product portfolio
management is possible only if a fi rm knows the profi t picture of each product it sells. Besides, it
is important to understand the marketing and support expenses needed or made for each product.
Several fi rms found to their dismay that they were spending far too much on the products in maturity
or decline stage of the product life cycle. Firms are known to have kept loss-making products in their
range either due to lack of knowledge about its profi tability or due to ego problems: &lsquo;this was our
fi rst product launched 10 years ago and it gave us lot of profi ts earlier.&rsquo;
<p>A fi rm needs to look at some of the other areas also as discussed next:
<p>1. Keep their current assets under control by tracking the inventory levels, use push sales technique
by passing on the inventories to the distribution channel members.
<p>2. Keep track of competitive pricing. Does the fi rm want to be the price leader or merely the price
follower? At times, fi rms increase their prices and they fi nd that the competition was just waiting
to follow suit.
<p>3. Keep track of customer complaints, their redress period and improvement or deterioration in
customer satisfaction levels for the product.
<p>4. Keep a technical audit of all technology-level complaints and ensure that the production, quality
and research and development (R&amp;D) people are aware of the same. They also need to ensure
time-bound correction of the fault levels.
<p>5. If the product has really failed then no amount of marketing effort or advertising can help it and
the management must decide quickly to withdraw it from the market as soon as possible.
<p>6. An audit on the advertising efforts and promotions must be made periodically to ensure that
these expensive efforts do not go in vain. The single variable technique, where the fi rm imposes
a ban on other promotional activities for a period, can give most precise results in this compli-
cated issue.
<p>7. How good are the salesmen, are they properly trained, totally motivated and committed to
their fi rm and their tasks, is the rivalry among them healthy or destructive can be assessed by </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 179
<p>obtaining and understanding the daily or weekly reports sent in by the salesmen. These control
points and their implementation plans must be made well in advance and told to the concerned
people with total transparency to get the best out of the team members.
<p>Firms should keep a good grip on things all the time because it would be futile to cry over spilt
milk. Timely corrective actions, like counselling of erring people, change in plan and altering time
schedules can become the guiding factors in the success of a fi rm.
<p>Is the fi rm exploiting the international marketing opportunities fully, product-wise, market-wise or
distribution-wise? The management team comprising the CEO, the international marketing director
and the fi nance director should jointly be involved in understanding the market position of the fi rm,
its ethical approach and societal responsibilities. The marketing director should use sales analysis,
country-wise, product-wise, area-wise, salesman-wise and distribution-wise to know the growth of
the market, the fi rm&rsquo;s market share, percentage of market expense to each areas&rsquo; sales and compare the
same with the objectives. A fi nancial market analyst should look at the profi t or loss situation for each
product, area salesman and distributor and compare the same with the objectives. The marketing
manager should evaluate the effi cacy of advertising, promotion, distribution channels and the salesmen
to help in modifying the plans to make them more effective as shown in Figure 6.5:
<p>Figure 6.5 Plan Modifi cation Process
<p>The decline in sales revenue and profi ts could be attributed to decline in the total market, decline
in the fi rm&rsquo;s market share, decline due to reduced prices or increase in selling expenses.
<p>A fi rm selling motorcycles had planned to sell 100,000 bikes in the year at a price of Rs 30,000
each, with the total revenue being Rs 300 crore. It was targeting a total of 25 per cent of the country&rsquo;s
market. However, it could sell only 80,000 bikes at a net price of Rs 25,000 each. The total revenue
was only Rs 200 crore. The market leaders in the bike business apparently got the balance of the
sale. The price revision had to be done to reduce the onslaught of competitive forces. The market,
in fact, increased by 10 per cent that year. By the virtue of market growth, the fi rm should have sold
11,000 bikes. The fi rm therefore lost total sales of 30,000 bikes. The loss of revenue due to loss in sales
is shown as follows:
<p>30,000 bikes @ Rs 30,000 is Rs 90 crore which is the loss due to decrease in the sales.
80,000 bikes @ Rs 5,000 the lowering in price is Rs 40 crore loss.
<p>An audit of the fi rm and its various branches can be quite an eye opener as at times when the fi rm
is making profi ts a few loss-making branches can be carried as extra baggage. The moment the tide
turns against the fi rm, these loss-making branches become the fi rst victims of the axe. The profi t
picture should be analysed for each branch, profi t centre, SBU, market segment and for discounts on
bulk buying. There are situations when each sale is loss making and increase in sales only adds to
the losses. These could be for products in the Dog Quadrant of the BCG Matrix. Firms must decide
proper strategy to get out of the loss situation at the soonest. In case of channels making profi ts also, is
the fi rm spending too much on helping them make profi ts, giving high commissions. It is worthwhile
to understand the brand equity versus the dealers&rsquo; reputation to accurately determine the level of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management180
<p>dealer commission to be paid. For new products in the market, the dealers do have the power as they
have been in touch with the customers selling them other products. Later on the fi rm develops product
brand equity, which helps in selling the product to a large extent, reducing the stranglehold of the
dealers. The commission can then be downsized in such a manner that the channel members remain
loyal, like asking them to participate in promotional plans and joint advertising efforts.
<p>At times a fi rm takes an intelligent knowing decision of selling a product on the basis of marginal
costing. The management must attribute the decision to locked inventory or for entering a new com-
petitive market. Whatever be the reason the loss in profi t must be self-evident and should not be made
a burden on the sales team that they should bring back the profi ts in the rest of the sales. Attempts at
doing so should be made and are praiseworthy.
<p>Similarly there is an age-old rivalry between product unit and the international sales force. When
the orders are not received in time and there is an inventory build up, the production team starts blam-
ing the sales force. Conversely, when orders exist and there are delays in dispatches the blame is borne
by the production. The situations like these cannot be totally eliminated, but can be reduced in inten-
sity by establishing coordination teams between the two departments and enforcing transparency in
operations of the two departments. The other option is of having local host-country licence production
or production from a wholly-owned subsidiary.
<p>It is therefore important to know if the fi rm&rsquo;s increase or decrease in market share is in consonance
with increase or decrease of the total market demand or not, else the fi rm can become complacent
about its achievements. Market share therefore assumes great importance in fi rms marketing plans.
Most CEOs consider market share and brand equity as two of the fi rm&rsquo;s most important assets. While
the growth of the market is dependent on factors outside of the fi rm, it affects the fi rm totally. The
fi rms should therefore realise the area which are responsible for increase or decline of the market at
any point of time.
<p>General business environment factors like legal issues affect the business. It is, however, quite
likely that they do not have the same effect on all the competitive fi rms. The 9/11 assault on the US
did shrink the tourism business but the effect was different on different fi rms.
<p>Firms should normally benchmark their operating results with the best in the industry. However, if
a fi rm is the market leader, then it should compare only with it&rsquo;s own past results or with the nearest
competitor only.
<p>Market share loss could be due to leaving unprofi table customers and areas and may lead to a better
bottom line. Entry of new fi rms in competition would lead to loss of share; but again the percentage
loss may not be the same for all the competitors.
<p>Market share depends on the number of customers with the fi rm, their buying patterns and
buying quantities, the ratio of the fi rm&rsquo;s buyers in the market and the purchase averages of the fi rm&rsquo;s
customers vis-&agrave;-vis the competitor&rsquo;s customers and it also depends on the price differential between
fi rms to some extent, especially for products for the low- and middle-income groups where price
sensitivity is a major issue.
<p>The effect of marketing expenses needs to be monitored and it should be a major criteria for the
way marketing plans are developed.
<p>As can be seen from Figure 6.6, in case the marketing expenses go up, the profi t may decline and
there may even be a loss. Marketing expenses can be divided as follows:
<p>1. Salaries and travel expenses of salesmen, which can be high in the international arena.
2. Advertising.
3. Sales promotion.
4. Distribution channel commission (unless, of course, the channel members are allowed to have
<p>a mark-up on prices).</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Environment for Business, Customer, Competition and Controls 181
<p>5. Sales overheads like administrative expenses rentals, telephones and other correspondences.
6. International marketing research.
<p>Depending on fi rms, these could vary a lot. Cola companies spend 25&ndash;30 per cent of their sales
revenue on advertising and promotion, while some industrial goods fi rm may not spend more than
5 per cent. Firm needs to benchmark these expenses and keep a checklist because at the end of the
year it may be found that the expenses have gone haywire without a resultant increase in sales and
profi ts. There, of course, can be regional and seasonal fl uctuations in these expenses, but fi rms
would do well to provide guidelines to the sales teams about the possible upper limits on each of the
expenses. The following gives an idea of prevalent expense as a percentage of sales turnover norms
in most industries (it would be better to go by the industry norms in most cases, unless the situation
is unusual like a product launch):
<p>1. Salaries of the sales team and travel expenses&mdash;10&ndash;15 per cent
2. Advertising&mdash;5&ndash;25 per cent
3. Promotion&mdash;3&ndash;10 per cent
4. Distribution channel commission&mdash;7&ndash;15 per cent
5. Sales overheads&mdash;2&ndash;5 per cent
6. Market research&mdash;0.5&ndash;1 per cent
<p>The variation seen here takes into consideration the product types&mdash;consumer durables, FMCG,
industrial and services. Individual industries need to take their historical norms if it is an already
existing one. Otherwise it can benchmark the most effi ciently run fi rm in the same business and which
is almost equal in size.
<p>Firms planning international marketing must build marketing scorecards (MSCs) for soft numbers
as against hard facts like sales, for the entire marketing department, which can be then modulated for
each sales team and each salesman. The MSCs should focus country-wise on the following:
<p>1. Master list of all the customers and prospective customers for industrial products.
2. Master list of the distribution channel members and their major clients for FMCG and consumer
<p>durables.
3. Master cards of all new customers giving their full particulars.
4. List of customer complaints and the delay in their redress and similar study of the
<p>competition.
5. Rating points on customer service as compared to the competition.
6. Current market segment being catered to and new segments, which can be targeted in the future.
7. Product awareness levels in the target market segment.
8. Product acceptance level in the target segment.

<p>International Marketing Management182
<p>The hidden costs of the marketing team must be unearthed so that they could be reduced if not
completely eliminated. They are:
<p>1. Cost of ineffi ciency
2. Cost of unethical practices
<p>Cost of ineffi ciency can be seen from low number of sales calls by the salesmen, low call effectiveness,
increase in cost per call, increase in entertainment expense without relative increase in sales, increase or
decrease in orders received with the money value of increase or decrease, customers lost or gained.
<p>Cost of unethical practices can be seen in undue lowering of rates for low volumes of orders, un-
matched inventories of accessories, unauthorised commitments by salesmen to customers causing
losses to the fi rm.
<p>In a nutshell, the marketing team should be given freedom of action within the framework of
authority but must also be accountable for achieving the fi rm&rsquo;s marketing objectives. Controls in the
area of marketing should be instituted more as a help to the sales team until they prove to be going
totally off the track.

<p>7 International Pricing
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Pricing in the international market needs an entirely different approach as the business environment and
competitive environment are perceptively different. This chapter will help students in gaining confi dence
for proper pricing in the world markets. Price becomes a factor of brand equity, competition and the
cost to sell in host countries, while cost to make can only defi ne the profi tability of product marketing
and, in extreme cases, whether the product should stay in the market or if it should be withdrawn.</p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management184
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>In the pre-Industrial Revolution era, the tribe centred political entities believed in the barter system
as a means of commerce in which two tribes swapped their produce as per the value each had
for each other&rsquo;s products.
<p>For example if tribe X had an excess of cotton and tribe Y had an excess of wheat, they would
exchange the products to satisfy their respective needs (see Figure 7.1). Then came the Industrial
Revolution with mass production techniques and emergent markets for products, which were far fl ung
in area. The need for money was felt and it gave commerce the much-needed fi llip. Now people could
buy and sell products as per their requirements of a larger variety of things (see Figure 7.2).
<p>Figure 7.1 Barter System
<p>Figure 7.2 Today&rsquo;s Trade
<p>Till that time there were only a few manufacturers of a product and competition was not known as a
business reality. With the Industrial Revolution, society started becoming affl uent and the demand for
most products started increasing. With demand increase came competition. Today we see competition
as a multi-headed dragon swallowing up lesser products or brands or badly-managed fi rms.
<p>A product that is sold is supposed to give satisfaction or delight to its user. Hence, international
marketers need to look at various other aspects of the product that go into providing the customer
satisfaction. The non-price areas are the services that go with the product, the guarantee, brand image,
availability of spares and easy usability. Export pricing assumes greater importance than the local
market price because internationally the company is fi ghting competition from a large number of
international players. Local pricing is built up of the following elements of costing:
<p>1. Fixed unit cost of the product.
2. Variable unit cost of the product.
3. Profi t margins planned.
4. Distribution costs.
5. Transportation costs.
<p>Product pricing in a highly-competitive world has assumed unprecedented importance in the
management of markets for fi rms&rsquo; profi tability, especially in the international markets where it is
easy to get out-priced by a competitive company.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Pricing 185
<p>The following are the elements considered when international prices are fi xed:
<p> 1. Production cost.
2. Profi t plans.
3. Brand image or equity in the host country.
4. Seasonality of business.
5. Market segment.
6. Competition.
7. Product life cycle stage.
8. Guarantee/warranty offered.
9. Payment methods and terms.
10. Currency fl uctuations.
11. Transportation costs, modes of transport, its frequency.
12. Discounts/special offers.
13. Range of products with the fi rm.
14. Product launches.
15. Product value and utility for the customers.
16. Outsourcing of manufacturing, its location and applicable transportation costs.
17. Status of the business environment, both general and competitive, in the host country.
18. Provision of continuous service, if required by the product.
19. Quantity purchases and regularity of purchase.
20. Prompt payment.
21. Marginal cost pricing. This is adopted when there is severe competition in the market and the
<p>company desires to get a foothold there. In such cases, only a small amount of the fi xed cost is
taken into consideration, while the price is fi xed substantially on the basis of variable cost.
<p>There are usually three types of market situations and each gives different pricing opportunities:
<p>1. Monopoly market
2. Oligopoly market
3. Perfect competition
<p>In case of monopoly, there is only one supplier of the product and in such cases the fi rm has the
following options:
<p>1. Charge a premium price or keep skimming price.
2. Keep cost plus, pricing.
<p>In oligopoly situations, there are just a few suppliers, say four or fi ve. In such cases, the customer&rsquo;s
purchasing power governs the price. In some cases, the fi rms join hands to form price cartels with a
view of keeping prices high for all the fi rms. In many countries, including India, cartel formation is
considered illegal.
<p>Perfect competition means having a large number of suppliers of the product. These could be of
the same type and size or could belong to different categories like the small-scale unorganised sector
or large-scale organised sector. In between there are medium-scale sectors, government companies,
multinational corporations and joint ventures. The unorganised sector has much lower overheads. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management186
<p>At times they avoid paying taxes and hence can price their products quite low. However, compared
to a monopoly&rsquo;s skimming prices, perfect competition usually brings about penetrating prices.
<p>Hence, the fi rst price formula can be shown as follows:
<p>Selling price = a f (manufacturing cost + profi t), where a is the effect of competition on price
and f denotes function.
<p>With competition becoming severe, its role in pricing has increased which can be shown as:
<p>Selling price = b f (competition), where b represents the manufacturing cost and f denotes
function.
<p>Let us consider products made for industry, that is, products for business-to-business sale. In most
of these cases, the price is negotiated between the seller and the buyer. For products for mass con-
sumption, with mass production techniques, costs can be brought down and lower price can be the
result. Products for mass consumption are becoming brand managed and the customers are becoming
brand conscious. Firms put higher prices on their products than the competition and still keep their
market share for the following reasons:
<p> 1. Better brand equity.
2. Better distribution network.
3. Loyal customers.
4. Complete range of products.
5. Better service to customers.
6. Differentiated product.
7. Better delivery periods.
8. Better payment terms.
9. Comprehensive longer guarantee and warrantee.
10. Better value for money.
11. Better sales team.
12. Tailor-made products or customisation of products.
13. Most importantly, better understanding of the customer&rsquo;s needs, as international buyers&rsquo;
<p>behaviour, international purchase motivations and salesmanship can be quite different from
those of the home country.
<p>It must be clearly understood that the customers do not pay for the product alone. They pay for
the value or the benefi t the product is going to provide them. It is the customer&rsquo;s perception of the
product&rsquo;s value to them that justifi es the price.
<p>Price and product quality gets fi rmly established in the minds of the customers and many times,
lowering of prices to increase market share becomes counterproductive as the customers feel that
there has been a lowering of quality in the product, which has caused the price reduction.
<p>The price fi xed for a new product is based on the following:
<p>1. Price of competitive product, if any.
2. Cost to manufacture.
3. Market segment for the product.
4. Product position in the market place.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Pricing 187
<p>5. Hierarchy of the distribution network. This determines the total sales commission to be paid
to the channel members.
<p>6. The product itself, its uniqueness as compared to the competition.
<p>As soon as the competition forces its way in the market, the fi rm has to decide to have one of the
following price methods:
<p>1. For a top-quality product:
Skimming price or top price, which will place the product in the elitist market segment and
<p>generate good profi ts.
Medium price, which will give good value for money to the customers and place the product
<p>in select markets.
Low price or penetrating price, which would place the product at the lower end of the segment
<p>and increase the fi rm&rsquo;s market share. It will act as an entry barrier for new players.
<p>2. For a medium-quality product:
Top or skimming price would provide extra profi ts, as also invite competition.
Medium price will give the customers value for money and place the product in a select
<p>market segment.
Low or penetrating price would place the product in the lower end of the segment, give
<p>value for money, increase the fi rm&rsquo;s market share and profi tability and increase barriers for
new entrants.
<p>3. For a low-quality product:
Top or skimming price would work only during monopoly regime, otherwise, it will lower
<p>market share and invite competition.
Medium price will place the product in a select market segment and invite competition.
Low or penetrating price would place the product in the lower end of the market segment,
<p>increase the fi rm&rsquo;s market share and become a price barrier for the entry of new players.
<p>Hence, the pricing strategy has to be evolved by fi rms by looking at the quality of the product,
its position in the life cycle and its market share. Firms must understand the price-demand pattern
for the product based on the selected market segment/s. The demand and price ratio varies with
products. In some the demand remains inelastic irrespective of price while for some products even a
slight change in product price changes the demand pattern drastically. The change in demand is also
dependent on the market segment being catered to by the product.
<p>It can be seen that the demand for high-end products like Mercedes cars, fi rst-class air travel, fi ve-
star hotel rooms and some of the essential items of daily needs like food, the demand remains near
constant with price changes as shown in Figure 7.3:
<p>Figure 7.3 High-End Price Demand Parity</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management188
<p>For products like consumer durables, refrigerators, ovens and fans the price is a major factor in
purchase decisions as shown in Figure 7.4:
<p>Figure 7.4 Consumer Durable Price Demand Parity
<p>Products that can show unique features, do not have many known substitutes and have low main-
tenance costs and are less price sensitive. As cost of manufacture does affect the fi nal price, let us discuss
what the cost is made of. There are fi xed costs, the overheads and variable costs, which constitute
the total manufacturing cost. Fixed costs remain unchanged with the volume of production, like the
interest the fi rm pays, the salaries, power, telephone and rental bills. In fact, even if there is no manu-
facture, these payments have to be made. Variable costs depend on the volume of production like the
cost of material and labour.
<p>Total cost = fi xed cost + variable cost.
<p>Suppose for manufacturing 5,000 computers, the fi xed cost is Rs 30 million and the variable cost
Rs 20 million, then the total cost would be:
<p>Total cost for 5,000 computers = (Rs 30 million + Rs 20 million) = Rs 50 million.
Fixed cost works out to Rs 6,000 and variable cost Rs 4,000 per computer.
Fixed cost per computer = 30,000,000/5,000 = Rs 6,000.
Variable cost per computer = 20,000,000/5,000 = Rs 4,000.
Total cost per computer = Rs 6,000 + Rs 4,000 = Rs 10,000.
<p>Let us see what happens when the fi rm doubles the production to 10,000.
<p>The fi xed cost gets reduced as now the total fi xed cost is divided by 10,000 as follows:
<p>Fixed cost = Rs 30,000,000/ 10,000 = Rs 3,000.
<p>The fi xed cost therefore gets reduced as the production increases. This is known as economies of
scale of manufacture.
<p>With experience in manufacture over a period of time, the workers improve their skills and human
error losses get reduced. This reduction directly refl ects in lowering of variable costs and this is known
as the experience curve effect. Firms strive for achieving cost leadership by means of manufactur-
ing as per economies of scale and providing the desired experience to the workers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Pricing 189
<p>PRICING FORMULAE
<p>The original method of pricing a product has been the cost plus method in which the total cost is
taken and profi t margin added to it.
<p>Suppose the unit variable cost of manufacturing a bicycle = Rs 300
Fixed cost = Rs 3,000,000
Sales planned = 100,000
Total unit cost = variable cost + fi xed cost/sales = Rs 300 + 3,000,000/100,000 = Rs 330
<p>If the sellers wants a 10 per cent mark-up then the selling price of the bicycle would be as
follows:
<p>Unit cost/1-mark-up or, Rs 330/1&ndash;0.1 = 330/0.9 = Rs 367 per bicycle.
<p>Pricing a product too high runs the danger of having no sales as also inviting new competition, while
too low a price may give sales volumes, but no profi t at all. Hence, pricing needs careful planning.
Sellers want that they should, even in the most severe competitive conditions, not lose money at least
on a regular basis. They look for getting a minimum of break-even sales volume (see Figure 7.5):
<p>Figure 7.5 Break-even Analysis
<p>A is the break-even point where the seller gets, at least the costs, both fi xed and variable, and that
is the minimum the fi rm would like to sell in the fi rst instance. Today, pricing has become more a
function of fi ghting competition, especially in the international markets than ever before. It is, besides
competitors, the customers who are guiding factors in price fi xation. The customers view a product
and its price on the following parameters:
<p>1. Brand name of the product/brand equity.
2. Product quality as perceived by the customer.
3. Uniqueness of the product.
4. Ease of availability of the product.
5. The product range&mdash;is it a single product offering from the fi rm or is it a product range.
6. Ease of usage of the product.
7. Availability of after-sales service&mdash;speed and quality of service.
8. Product price in totality including price of consumables, loss due to down time and price of
<p>accessories.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management190
<p>Firms resort to penetrating pricing in order to increase their market share. Following the leader,
other competitors also bring down the prices. Hence, the advantage of lower price is only short-lived,
which brings the original market share out of the fi rms back, but for minor changes. It, however, leaves
a lasting dent on the profi t picture of the fi rm. This factor has, at least in oligopoly conditions, been
responsible for the formation of price cartels&mdash;formal, if allowed by the government; informal, if not
allowed by the government. These cartels help fi rms to keep skimming the price of their product or
increasing the price of their product, without losing business to competition. Besides government
regulations, the other danger to cartels is the distinct possibility of more competitors joining the race.
<p>In case of government customers, mostly sealed tenders are invited from the manufacturers/sellers
of the product. In the tender business, fi rms have normally to send two different offers as follows:
<p>1. A technical bid giving the product&rsquo;s technical specifi cations, capabilities and conformance to
the specifi cations needed by the buyer.
<p>2. A commercial bid giving the price and other terms of business.
<p>The sealed bids are opened on a designated date, time and place in front of the bidders. First, the
technical bids are seen and those not meeting the desired specifi cations are excluded from the tender.
Next, the commercial bids are opened and the buyer decides the fi rm(s) with whom the order is to
be placed on its basis.
<p>FINALISATION OF PRICE
<p>The following attributes are taken into consideration at the time of price fi nalisation:
<p>1. Price and quality perceptions of the target market customers. In many products, price and
quality do get interlinked and any lowering of price or keeping price lower than competition
has a defi nite effect on the customer&rsquo;s mindset, as they believe that a lower price could mean
a product with lower quality too.
<p>2. Brand equity.
3. Advertising penetration and effect on the customers.
4. Price of other products of the fi rm in relative terms of their importance to the customers.
5. International prices could depend on the relative balance of payment situation with a particular
<p>country, currency exchange rates and tariffs. (It would be of interest to students to know that
during the existence of the USSR, India&rsquo;s trade with it was known as rupee trade, as both the
countries were short of hard currency, the dollar. Needless to add, the USSR had no need of
our rupee and we had none for their money. It was in a sense a barter arrangement where each
country would sell to the other some useful but mostly useless items to the other country).
<p>6. It could also be in two parts, one part could be a barter arrangement and the other could be on
the basis of cash payment.
<p>Summarising, it can be said that fi rms need to have information on international competition
and the customer&rsquo;s psychology before the price can be fi xed correctly. As the markets are dynamic
entities, the pricing mechanism also has to be kept in readiness for changes as per market needs and
a fi rm&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Pricing 191
<p>As most consumer and several industrial products are sold through distribution channels, their
price must take into account the margins to be offered to the channel members or their possible
mark-ups, if they are given one price by the manufacturer and asked to add their profi ts or mark-up
on to the price. Hence, the retail price could be made up of the following:
<p>Figure 7.6 International Pricing
<p>When the fi rm offers its price to the customer as maximum retail price, it includes the margin given
to the channel members, which could be as shown in Figure 7.6 or different. Besides, fi rms offer cash
discounts if the channel members pay cash. Discounts on offer could be the following:
<p>1. Cash discount on cash purchases.
2. Turnover discounts given on the basis of the channel member achieving a given and accepted
<p>turnover in product sales.
3. Inventory clearing discount is given when the fi rm has a large inventory and the discount acts
<p>as an incentive for the dealer to buy more.
4. Quantity discount is offered for the purchase of a minimum specifi ed quantity.
5. Advertising subsidy is actually the money given as share of the common advertising by the
<p>fi rm and the channel member.
6. Off-season discount is given for buying the product when it is not needed like buying woollens
<p>during summers and air conditioners during winters. (In fact, for air conditioners there is, at
times, a premium during summer.)
<p>7. Prizes for super-achievers among the channel members are offered to those dealers who have at
the end of the year done remarkably well. It could be a gift or a free trip to some exotic location
at the fi rm&rsquo;s expense.
<p>Price changes occur due to special circumstances also. At times, fi rms want to generate extra cash
and they offl oad products at a much lower price, even at a loss. In exhibitions and melas, special prices
are offered to exploit the buying mood of the people visiting these places. Cash discount to the channel
members can be extended further to the customer/user, which would ultimately reduce stocks in the
distribution channel and the fi rms can then have additional sales.
<p>A major cost-related incentive offered these days is low-cost fi nance to the buyer, who can buy the
product on borrowed money and pay the fi nancier in instalments. Cars, houses and several consumer
durables are being sold in large quantities, which have affected the sale of second-hand goods in
India. Extra help can be provided by way of extended payment terms making buying easy and with
no worry of making payments.
<p>Service marketing offers different types of challenges to the sellers. For example, a fi ve-star hotel
may get two types of customers as follows:
<p>1. One person who comes alone, stays for a day in one year and spends about Rs 5,000.
2. Another person comes three times a month, brings three&ndash;four colleagues with him and spends
<p>about Rs 500,000 per annum on hotel bills.</p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management192
<p>It is said that the customer is king. Can we say that the second customer is defi nitely the king?
What about the fi rst one? Is he only a prince? Maybe he will become a king in time.
<p>Most service industries therefore need to do a customer value analysis (CVA). For a fi ve-star
hotel the following matrix (Figure 7.7) needs to be completed to give a proper designation to each
customer&ndash;customer group:
<p>Figure 7.7 Sample of Customer Groups for Determining CVA
<p>Tourist solo
<p>Tourists in groups
<p>Small businessman
<p>Senior executives
<p>MNC executives
<p> The type of room taken&mdash;ordinary, deluxe or a suite.
Usage of the health club by the guest.
Usage of the bar, restaurant, room service by the guest.
Usage of the business centre by the guest.
Usage of laundry service.
Usage of national and international telephony available.
Usage of any other facility provided by the hotel by the guest.
<p>Each customer is rated between 1&ndash;5 and only then can the hotel decide about the true value of a
particular customer to them.
<p>Coming to pricing, the following elements go into the pricing of a hotel room:
<p>1. CVA
2. Competitive pricing
3. Cost to sell the room
4. Seasonality
5. Location of the hotel

<p>International Business-to-Business Marketing 195
<p>With globalisation taking roots in the world of business, students should be ready for handling
assignments on business-to-business marketing as a lot of export of software, raw materials
and components fall in this category. As we try to understand the business market, we should
<p>know how much it is different from the consumer market, what are its salient features, the buying
decision process and identify the decision-makers in the business. It is important to know the people
who infl uence buying decisions. At times it is the government that buys and this falls in a somewhat
different category.
<p>Business buying is a process, by which the business defi nes its need for a product or service, fi nds
out the various vendors supplying the product, scrutinises each vendor carefully and then decides
which is the best-suited one. The next step is the action step, of placing the order.
<p>Business buying is distinguished from consumer buying as there are normally fewer but large volume
buyers and they tend to have a long-term commitment to the vendors/suppliers. The marketers therefore
need to cultivate the buyers and build business relationships with them.
<p>Business or industrial buying has the following main features:
<p>1. The demand for raw materials and components depends on the production plans of their buyers
and hence it is indirect or derived demand. If car sales go down, the sale of tyres will be affected
too. Cement demand is connected to construction activity in a country.
<p>2. As the buyers price their fi nal product taking the prices of all the different components which
go in to making of the product, the demand remains fi rm with little or no change with changes
in price. Of course, buying from a particular fi rm may fl uctuate only if it increases the price of
the product and other competitors do not.
<p>3. An increase in consumer goods demand skyrockets the demand of components, raw materials
and capital goods.
<p>4. Major purchase decisions in a fi rm are group or team activities. The user initiates the purchase
action by sending his requisition to the purchase manager (PM). The purchase manager then
gets it vetted by the technical manager to get complete product specifi cations. Afterwards, a
tender is fl oated or selected vendors are asked to bid their price. The fi nance manager then looks
at the price bid. Finally, the comparative pricing along with technical specifi cation compliance
by each of the bidders is studied and the fi nal purchase recommendations are made, to be ap-
proved by the chief executive offi cer (CEO). The process is described in Figure 8.1.
<p>The people involved in the decision-making process have one goal&mdash;that of buying the right
product at competitive prices. However, due to the nature of their activities, it manifests differently
as can be seen from the following:
<p>1. A user wants a product he has used earlier, or as he wants if it is a research project.
2. A purchase manager wants to buy the traditional product to avoid inventory problems.
3. A technical manager wants a state-of-the-art product.
4. A fi nance manager wants a value for money product.
5. A CEO wants only the best product.
<p>While the product remains the same, its attributes and benefi ts can be put across differently to
various persons to satisfy their needs as stated earlier. The decision process takes the shape of a triangle
known as the decision triangle as shown in Figure 8.2.</p>

<p>F: This is the area of ignorance and sellers have to provide a lot of information to the buyer.
E: This is the first level of doubts from the buyer, which must be clarified by the seller
<p>effectively.
D: This is the second level of hostility because competitors hold on to customers. The sellers must
<p>give added benefi ts to counter the competition&rsquo;s hold on the customer.
C: In the third level, the attack is direct: &lsquo;Your product is too expensive or it is not good enough.&rsquo;
<p>At this point, testimonials from important local and overseas customers must be shown to the
customers. Additional guarantee can be offered if need be.
<p>B: The customer usually likes to dither at this stage: &lsquo;I have to ask my partners. I do not have the
required authority.&rsquo; Usually the customer is bluffi ng and the incentive of prompt payment
discount or extra credit facility if a prompt order is placed can be given.
<p>A: At this point, the seller should offer an either/or option: &lsquo;You want us to insure or you will take
care of it.&rsquo; The answer to this question &lsquo;okay you do it&rsquo; or &lsquo;no we will take care of it&rsquo; means that
now you can ask the buyer to sign the purchase order.
<p>Once the purchase order is in your hands, do not linger in the customer&rsquo;s offi ce. Thank him and
come out fast. At times the customer may just want to have another look at the order and say, &lsquo;Okay,
the order is yours but leave it with me for the next two days so that I can show it to my brother.&rsquo; The
order could be shown to your competitor and the next day he may walk away with your order! This
practical suggestion is the result of experience of a number of sellers and should not be ignored.

<p>One important link in the decision-making process is the role of infl uencers and those who veto
the decision. Infl uencers are the people who wield an extra-hierarchical authority, which is often
unwritten and only understood. Those who veto the decision are the top brass, like the fi rm&rsquo;s chairman,
who can veto the decisions of even the CEO. Thus, it can be seen that the decision-making process is
channelled through the following people:
<p> 1. The user or the initiator of the requirement.
2. The purchase assistant who starts the purchase action.
3. The technical manager who provides the detailed specifications of the product to be
<p>purchased.
4. The production manager who has to perhaps ultimately approve its usage.
5. The fi nance manager who looks for the investment angle.
6. The stores manager who has to arrange for the inventory and its control.
7. The infl uencers who help in the decision-making process and can almost force a decision on
<p>the CEO.
8. The decider or the CEO whose ultimate responsibility is to see the profi table growth of the
<p>fi rm.
9. Those who hold the power of veto, usually the chairman of the fi rm.
10. Stoppers or gatekeepers who are the competitor&rsquo;s unoffi cial agents and who try to keep
<p>the fi rm at bay by giving wrong information and misleading them while trying to pose
as their best friend. Firms should be on guard against such people by trying to locate and
isolate them.
<p>In most fi rms, for major purchases there is a purchase committee, which is empowered to either
decide on the purchase or is only empowered to give its recommendation to the CEO. The sellers
therefore must cultivate the fi rm&rsquo;s entire purchase team and communicate with the team members
in a language best appreciated by each individual. For example, the sellers can take the following
communication route:
<p>1. To the user: Sir, the new product is so user-friendly that you will fi nd it twice as easy to use
than the present product.
<p>2. To the purchase person: Sir, once you buy the product, its reliability of supply and its quality
will minimise your inventory worries.
<p>3. To the fi nance person: Sir, we give value for money with the lowest rejection rate in the industry.
You can be sure of production continuity.
<p>4. To the technical person: Sir, this state-of-the-art product will let you in on the latest user-friendly
technology and your technical team will love to use the product for further innovating your
own fi nal product, much to the delight of your customers.
<p>5. To the infl uencers: Sir, buying our product would certainly enhance your own image in the fi rm.
6. To the decider: Sir, we know of your desire to buy only the top-of-the-line product and hence
<p>you will surely decide in favour of our product.
7. To the person who holds the power of veto: Sir, buying our product while vetoing others will
<p>raise the prestige of your fi rm and its brand equity.
<p>In order to communicate to each of these people it is useful to get the counterparts of the purchase
committee to talk to the fi rm&rsquo;s members as follows:</p>
