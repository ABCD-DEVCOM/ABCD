<p>1. The buyer&rsquo;s purchase manager with the seller&rsquo;s international sales manager.
2. The buyer&rsquo;s production or technical manager with the seller&rsquo;s research and development
<p>manager.
3. The buyer&rsquo;s fi nance manager with the seller&rsquo;s international fi nance manager.
4. The buyer&rsquo;s CEO with the seller&rsquo;s international CEO.
<p>In all such meetings, the marketing executive works as a liaison or coordinator.
<p>PURCHASE NEGOTIATIONS IN TENDER AND
NON-TENDER BUSINESSES
<p>Big volume buyers usually call three or four short-listed vendors for the fi nal negotiations on price
and terms of business. These negotiations are similar in both tender and non-tender businesses.
The main consideration of the buyer is to get the best out of the deal by playing one vendor against
the other. The dialogue goes something like this:
<p>Buyer: &lsquo;Your prices are very high compared to MS X, your main competitor.&rsquo;
Seller: &lsquo;I am sure you will compare the quality of our product and our service too.&rsquo;
Buyer: &lsquo;Yes, but the price difference is so big that I cannot justify purchasing from you.&rsquo;
Seller: &lsquo;Can you give me an idea of the price they have quoted?&rsquo;
Buyer: &ldquo;It is nearly 20 per cent cheaper than your price.&rsquo;
<p>In such cases, especially if the location is away from the seller&rsquo;s headquarters, it is advisable for the
seller to keep the following information at hand for carrying out successful negotiations:
<p>1. Comparative statement of previous quoted prices and negotiated prices for the same product
and with the same competitors internationally.
<p>2. Product costing with elements of fi xed and variable costs.
3. Floor price, that is, the lowest price to which the seller has the fi rm&rsquo;s authority to go down to.
4. Authority to modify terms of business like payment terms, guarantee period, warranty terms,
<p>faster delivery periods, if these become necessary to clinch the order.
<p>While the sanctity of the tender business is its transparency, most buyers fl aunt it for the sake of
getting the best deal.
<p>Industrial sales or business-to-business sales can be a long drawn out process as the money value
of the orders are usually large and the buyers want the best deal. Hence, several sales calls, visits by
technical experts, fi nancial experts, quality management team members and turnkey project engineers
become essential.
<p>Industrial buying is mostly directly from the manufacturers but, in case of raw materials and com-
ponents, the sellers use the services of distribution channels, especially when there are several buyers
strewn all over the country. In this case also the manufacturer has to provide technical support to the
channel members. Buyers prefer to buy from those vendors who in some way are their customers too.
A tyre company&rsquo;s fl eet of cars is usually bought from the car manufacturer who buys tyres from them.
Leasing and hire purchase is an option increasingly being used by buyers and the seller who offers </p>

<br>
<p>International Business-to-Business Marketing 199
<p>the best option tends to get the deal. Several large fi rms hire out cars to be given to their employees
rather than buying them as it saves on capital expenses.
<p>Government Tender Business
<p>In India, there are two types of tenders, running contracts and rate contracts. In running contracts, the
Director General of Supply and Disposals (DGS&amp;D) fl oats a tender and on receipt of offers negotiates
with fi rms about the rate and quantity for the product along with other terms of business for a period
of time and the offi ces of the government can then place direct orders with the vendor on those prices
and terms. For this purpose the government offi ce has to register itself with the DGS&amp;D as a direct
demanding offi ce. As against this, a rate contract is for a product purchase at a fi xed rate for the
period of contract only.
<p>Umbrella Buying or Turnkey Solutions
<p>Business buyers prefer to buy a large range of products from one source and hence a number of
sellers tie up for providing turnkey solutions which can become cost-effective as also take away the
headache of dealing with several vendors. In taking buying decisions, the buyers are greatly infl uenced
by &lsquo;who says so!&rsquo; In case the industry leaders give a good reference for the turnkey operations the
selling becomes easy.
<p>In business purchasing, long-term contracts with accepted vendors reduce buying problems to a
large extent as vendors take special care of such customers by offering new products to them fi rst,
handling complaints quickly, giving prompt replacements for defective or even suspected to be
defective goods. Most buyers, however, keep at least one more vendor as a marginal supplier to avoid
getting into the problems that arise out of putting all of one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket.
<p>Let us examine factors that contribute to industrial purchases. Macroeconomic factors like demand
and supply of money, product demand and its life cycle position, rate of technological obsolescence,
competition and governmental stability factors affect industrial purchases. Organisational factors like
purchase policy of reordering levels, policy of just in time (JIT) orders, vendor assessment procedures,
centralised or decentralised purchasing and seasonality of business affect the buying process, as do
strikes and natural calamities. In international buying cultural factors play an important role.
<p>THE INDUSTRIAL BUYING PROCESS
<p>Let us now discuss the entire industrial buying process. The following can be considered as industrial
products:
<p>1. Capital goods, plants and machinery
2. Turnkey projects
3. Raw materials</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management200
<p>4. Components
5. Sub-assemblies
<p>The method of marketing capital goods and turnkey projects have some commonality, while the
other three come under one product group. Let us discuss the process of capital goods sale and turn-
key projects or total systems. In this case, the number of buyers is small and the suppliers are mostly
well known. The buyers approach the sellers who put up the bid giving technical details as called
for, assurance of quality, at times even the list of their vendors and price information. The following
information is also given in the quotations:
<p> 1. Assembly and sub-assembly process, individual and system guarantee and warranty.
2. Facility and provision for training the buyer&rsquo;s technical personnel.
3. Photocopies of the actual guarantee cards of bought out components.
4. List of recommended spare parts with their prices.
5. Price escalation clause.
6. Installation and commissioning time period and costs and help involved, including manpower
<p>needed by the seller from the buyer during the installation and commissioning periods.
7. Payment terms along with delivery schedule.
8. Post-guarantee period cost of servicing and service contract prices.
9. Sellers seek the authority from the buyer to subcontract part of the job, like installation and
<p>commissioning.
10. Sellers seek approval from the buyer to receive payment on part supply of equipment.
11. If there are variations in product specifi cations, these are brought out by the sellers and
<p>specifi cally approved by the buyer. In case such approval is not given then the sellers have to
reconsider the entire bid.
<p>Capital goods or turnkey projects are normally not manufactured by one fi rm. The fi rm that
makes the largest part takes the role of the lead bidder and others support the lead bidder with their
quotes to the leaders. In some major tenders, the sellers are asked to submit two separate bids for the
same tender&mdash;one containing a technical compliance report of the tender specifi cations and the other
giving the price and other commercial terms of the tender. The buyer in such cases opens the tech-
nical compliance bid fi rst and shortlists only those bidders who have full compliance with the tender
specifi cations. Other bids are rejected.
<p>Next, the technically-compliant bidders&rsquo; commercial bids are opened and again the fi rms are
shortlisted on the basis of acceptability of the price delivery terms and payment modes. The technical
and purchase experts then give their fi nal recommendations about the sellers on the shortlist to the
fi rm&rsquo;s CEO, that is, they recommend who should be awarded the tender. If two or more fi rms are
close in their bids, then the buyer calls them in for negotiations.
<p>For turnkey projects in India, the government has started another method of awarding business
called BOT&mdash;build, operate and transfer. In such jobs, the seller builds the project, runs it for a selected
period (and gains profi t out of it) and then transfers it to the government. Bridges and highways are
some examples of BOT projects.
<p>Turnkey jobs or systems selling call for a large variety of products and expertise in marketing
fi nance technology and coordination between a large number of suppliers. For the customer, the main
advantage is that he has to deal with only one vendor.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Business-to-Business Marketing 201
<p>The marketing person should be looking into the following aspects in the buyer&rsquo;s organisation
in industrial sales:
<p> 1. The decision-making process.
2. The hierarchy of decisions, including recommendations.
3. The authority to purchase at different levels.
4. Does it have a culture of innovation or does it like to maintain status quo?
5. Is purchasing from headquarters only?
6. Is there decentralised buying?
7. Internet&rsquo;s infl uence in the purchase department.
8. Product grouping like ABC analysis.
9. Immediacy of demand&mdash;are they regularly asking for emergency supplies or it is only once
<p>in a while?
10. Long-term business contract.
11. Short-term contract.
12. On the spot buying.
13. Seasonality of their business and of their purchasing.
14. Do they prefer a single vendor or multiple vendors?
15. Do they provide advance payment if needed?
16. Payment reputation&mdash;are they prompt or do they delay payments?
17. Associated business and other assets and liabilities.
18. Firm&rsquo;s reputation among vendors.
<p>In the second half of the twentieth century, the orientation of fi rms had shifted from just pur-
chase to material management. Today, it has further changed to supply management or supply
chain management. The theory of JIT supplies is a corollary of supply chain management. Long-term
relationship with the vendor, which is almost like a partnership and vendor development ensures
continuity of good quality product supply whenever needed. These help the vendors too as they are
sure of getting the orders or better still they always have a rolling supply order, which keeps getting
replenished on its getting over with all ordered supplies made by the vendor.
<p>However, the common practice even today is having multiple supply sources to ensure supplies
even when one vendor maybe facing a crisis. Buyers tend to put a lot of products in the generic group
where any vendor is good enough to supply and they have only shortest term purchase planning.
The vendors would therefore do well to understand the mindset of the buyer and then decide about
marketing strategies for the buyer.
<p>Internationally, industrial buyers have the following considerations while placing orders:
<p>1. Inventory status, maximum and minimum stock plans for each item to be purchased.
2. Reordering levels which depend on the diffi culty of procuring the product due to the lack of
<p>its suppliers, it being from far off places or overseas.
3. ABC analysis of the products to be bought.
4. Production plans taking into account the seasonality of the demand of the buyers&rsquo; fi nal
<p>product.
5. Storage space.
6. JIT plan of procurement.
7. Past experience of product rejections.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRIAL MARKETING RESEARCH
<p>In the fi rst half of the twentieth century, industrial marketing research was done using simple
methods like counting the number of chimneys or looking at the new industrial licenses issued by the
government. Today, the industrial scene is much more complex as no license is required for setting up
industries. However, information is available through secondary research as a number of magazines
and journals are printed giving industrial information. State governments have started industrial
parks, which house a number of industries. There are clusters of industries in various parts of the
country where the government provides tax concessions. Besides, there are market research agencies
which are continuously involved in doing research that can be purchased.
<p>Industrial purchase decisions can be triggered by a number of reasons as follows:
<p>1. Market research informs of the need for a new innovative product for which capital-
manufacturing equipment is required.
<p>2. Old equipment needs to be replaced with state-of-the-art equipment.
3. Change in technology of manufacture.
4. Raw material or components purchased is sub-standard.
5. Fresh vendor assessment.
<p>Once the need has been established, it is necessary to correctly defi ne the product, make a detailed
list of its specifi cations, expected prices and possible vendors. Looking for possible suppliers can start
with existing vendors of similar products, journals about those products, trade magazines and even
competitors. In case of raw material and components, trade journals, existing suppliers and competitors
can be a good source of information. Once the vendor list is fi nalised, a limited tender or a request for
quotation is made in writing where detailed specifi cations of the product and the expected delivery
time are given.
<p>Final vendor selection needs careful scanning of the following factors besides the scrutiny of its
technical and commercial bid:
<p>1. Past record of the vendor.
2. List of its customers.
3. Testimonials from customers about the quality of the vendor&rsquo;s product and service.
4. Visit to a manufacturing unit where the product may be in use, in coordination with the vendor,
<p>with the possibility of discussions with the users there.
5. The vendor&rsquo;s fi nancial status.
6. The vendor&rsquo;s fl exibility of supplies.
<p>The next logical step is making a detailed purchase order giving details of the product to be
purchased with all its specifi cations, price payment terms, details about the delivery period with
guarantee and warranty terms and other service facilities that need to be specifi ed. Once the product
is received and used, feedback from the user is essential for the purpose of further purchases from
the same vendor.</p>

<p>COMPETITION IN INDUSTRIAL BUYING
<p>Competition comes if the buyer starts vertical integration, that is, the buyer starts to manufacture
what it was buying from the fi rm. Vertical integration is of two types:
<p>1. Forward vertical integration: Here the vendor starts to manufacture the product it was selling.
For example, if a cloth maker starts to make readymade garments or a television picture tube
maker starts making television sets, it would be called forward vertical integration. In such
case there is loss of a customer.
<p>2. Backward vertical integration: Here the buyer starts to make the component he was buying
for his manufacturing unit. For example, if a cloth maker starts making yarn and a television
maker starts making television picture tubes, it would be called backward vertical integration.
In such a case also a customer is lost.

<p>9 International Marketing
of Services
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
The importance of the service sector in international markets is increasing by the day. A number of
Indian companies have started international ventures and others are planning the same. Marketing
of international services would require special strategies and treatment as compared to marketing of
tangible goods. Students will learn about the marketing process and philosophy behind marketing
of services in this chapter.</p>

<p>International Marketing of Services 205
<p>The importance of the service sector in the international market is increasing by the day as a
number of Indian companies have started international ventures and others are planning the
same. Marketing of such international services requires special emphasis and treatment as
<p>compared to marketing of tangible goods. It is therefore important to defi ne service as follows:
<p>Any act or performance that one party offers to another which is in reality intangible and does
not result in any ownership by the receiver of the service. Production may or may not be a
physical product.
<p>An important factor in the marketing of services is an understanding of the host country&rsquo;s cultural
ethos, religious sentiments and accepted practices for providing the services.
<p>The service sector includes the following business entities:
<p>1. Hotel industry: There are a number of Indian hotel brands doing business overseas.
2. Airlines: Several Indian airlines fl y to foreign destinations.
3. Hospitals: The international business in Medicare has increased in the country.
4. Insurance: This has always been part of international trade as products exported or imported
<p>are insured against transit risks.
5. Schools and colleges: International students are enrolling in Indian schools while Indian students
<p>also go overseas for studies.
6. Travel agents: International travel and tourism has remained a key factor of international
<p>marketing and today the Government of India is doing everything possible to provide the
impetus that travel and tourism in India requires.
<p>Giving a haircut, babysitting or giving tuitions to students are examples of service. There are
service areas that are connected to products too. However, the marketing of services is characterised
by the following elements:
<p>1. Intangibility
2. Inseparability
3. Variability
4. Perishability
5. Personality
<p>INTANGIBILITY
<p>Most of us like to eat out at restaurants. While inside the restaurant, the customer uses its facilities
like its furniture, air-conditioning and enjoys the food. The moment he steps out of the restaurant,
he has nothing of the restaurant with him except the food he has eaten and perhaps pleasant or bad
memories. While travelling by air, a passenger occupies a chair, which he is not going to carry with
him once he gets off the aircraft. Some may like the experience of travelling by air, its comfort and
airline&rsquo;s food while others may not like it at all. The tangible factors, experienced only in the duration
of the fl ight, would be the aircraft, the attendants and the food and drinks that are served on the
aircraft. The service is something felt by the users and hence its proper communication, quality levels
and people involved play a major role in giving it a form. Unlike products, which can be patented, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management206
<p>service cannot be and therefore it is impossible to copy the same. It is the personal touch, which can
make service quite unique. In the international arena, a service touches people in a positive way if it
is provided in accordance with their customs, in a language they understand and with the requisite
courtesy that makes them feel important.
<p>INSEPARABILITY
<p>Customer and service are connected by the service being provided. Can a patient be removed from the
operation he is undergoing? A barber has to use his scissors only on his customer. Unlike products,
which can be manufactured at one place and sold at other, services cannot be removed from the
location where the customer is present. The problem arises when in a hospital there is only one heart
surgeon and two patients need an emergency operation at the same time. The surgeon and the patient
are therefore inexorably intertwined during the surgical procedure. Similarly, in college, students and
teachers are a part of the service-providing process.
<p>VARIABILITY
<p>As people provide service, no two persons can give identical service. Service as a product looks
for providing quality to the customers. However, the individualistic trait of its character makes it
independent of any major regimen. The hotel industry takes pride in training its personnel to uni-
formly provide excellent service as per the service manual of the hotel. Can anyone make a standard
specifi cation of a smile which the service provider offers with the service?
<p>PERISHABILITY
<p>Hotel room, which remain unoccupied, or airlines seats, which go vacant, are two examples of product
&lsquo;service&rsquo; being only short-lived: you need to use it or it expires.
<p>PERSONALITY
<p>Service is highly dependent on individual personalities. The manager of a restaurant once greeted a
couple, who were visiting the restaurant for the fi rst time, by introducing himself and then enquiring
about their names, favourite foods and the table they liked. When the same couple visited again after
a couple of months, the manager greeted them by their names, gave them their favourite table and
could talk about what food they may order this time around. One bank manager would help his
preferred customers when they came in a hurry by paying them against their cheques from his offi ce.
Such personalised service brings rewards for the fi rm by ensuring them loyal customers. Therefore,
in the service industry, there is a great importance attached to human resources and its training.
Service fi rms do a lot to ensure loyalty of their employees, which in turn helps it in improving
its service standards.
<p>Imagine a large shop where the customers are treated in an impersonal way as the salesman
fails to distinguish them from the commodities he wants to sell. If the same customer were to go to a </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing of Services 207
<p>shop where the salespersons attend to them and looked after their needs, the customer would have
a completely different shopping experience.
<p>Service and Products
<p>With almost all products there is an element of service attached. In the same way, with most services,
there is product involved. When customers purchase consumer durables, the product is guaranteed
to be fault free for a period of time and during this period the manufacturer provides free service
for the product. Car manufacturers offer a number of free services to ensure the smooth running of
the car. Likewise, the tangible product in air travel is the air ticket and in a hospital it is the medicines
given to patients.
<p>Service as Product
<p>Service as product has the benefi t of immediate customer feedback as the users are using the product
in front of the service provider. Most restaurants keep customer feedback forms, which help them
build a quality management programme suitable to their clientele. Some services like telecom service
need prompt complaint redresses otherwise not only will they have customer dissatisfaction but they
also lose in revenue as the user has to use the service to enable the service provider to bill them for
usage. Poor service in hospitals can even prove fatal for its clients and the service providers are duty
bound to provide the best possible service to the patients. International service providers must keep
the standards of the host country as their benchmark.
<p>Attention to Complaints
<p>In most service products, the customers are supposed to enjoy the total experience provided by the
service. In a restaurant it is the ambience, the seating arrangement, the music or the live band, the air-
conditioning, the food and its service, which together give the guest an enjoyable experience. If even
one element causes complaints, the entire experience could be a bad one. Hence the service provider
has to organise total quality management or better still total customer management, in which case
each act or process of providing service is directed to the customers. However, in case of customer
dissatisfaction about any part of the service, immediate attention of the service management is re-
quired to douse the fi re of dissatisfaction and ensure it does not recur. International service providers
can even lose their entire business in such cases.
<p>Responsibility of Service Quality
<p>In many cases, the process of service is a sequence of tasks performed by various people. It is therefore
easy to shift the blame and pass on the buck to someone else. Cable operators shift the blame of poor
reception of some channels by saying that the channels themselves are not providing strong signals </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management208
<p>and nothing can be done about it. A bank manager can say that he could not credit your account
as the head offi ce has not cleared the incoming cheque. A car insurance company can say that the
damage assessor has not submitted his report and the claim cannot be settled. The answer is in some-
one taking integrated responsibility for the timely execution of service by coordinating the different
related activities.

<p>Let us take the famous 4Ps of marketing:
<p>Product: As discussed earlier, service as a product has an element of physical product attached
to it. Likewise, each product has some service with it. When dresses are purchased, the products
are the clothes and the salespersons efforts in convincing the customer, showing him the variety
of clothes amounts to providing service. When a customer visits a restaurant, the waiter provides
him with service and the product purchased is the food he eats there.
<p>The following items provide examples of products with a negligible service element to them:
<p>1. Dresses
2. Jewellery
3. Furniture
4. Housing
<p>The following are examples of products that have a very large element of service to them:
<p>1. Restaurants
2. Hotels
3. Hospitals
4. Airlines
5. Travel agents
<p>The following are largely services with a negligible tangible element about them:
<p>1. Hair dressing</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing of Services 209
<p>2. TV repair
3. Medical diagnosis
4. Dental care
<p>The seasonality of service demand can be seen from the high demand for dry-cleaning just before
winters in India or hotels during summer vacations. In order to bolster the demand during the off-
season, the service industry offers off-season discounts like hotel room upgrades, discounts on dry-
cleaning and the like. French telecom offers a mini computer&mdash;Minitel&mdash;free with which users get
access to a host of websites.
<p>Table 9.2 gives an idea of how supply and demand is managed in a hotel:
<p>Table 9.2 Hotel Industry Supply Demand Paradigm
<p>Season Off-season
<p>Price Increase prices for high-demand rooms Price promotions
Promotion For higher usage of hotel facilities For encouraging a visit
Product/Process Faster check-ins and check-outs,
<p>self-service restaurants, buffets
Better personalised service, silver service
<p>meals, free drinks on arrival
People Train more people, keep temporary
<p>staff for jobs with no customer contact
Give extended service periods in restaurants,
<p>provide free sight-seeing trips
<p>In certain resort locations no one can build a hotel for seasonal demand and hence the hotels must
optimise the facilities for customer satisfaction and delight. In other service areas too the service pro-
vider must build in the fl exibility to cater to a varied number of customers.
<p>Let us understand clearly that each organisation must become a service-oriented organisation,
because it is only with differentiated services that it can get a sustainable competitive advantage
(SCA). It is only with prompt service, which is better than the service provided by the competition, that fi rms
can satisfy or delight a customer. Needless to add, the needs of the customers are ever changing, not
only for product but also how he wants to be attended to while the service delivery takes place.
The following guidelines are provided for the purpose:
<p>1. Total quality in service management: It starts with personnel selection, well-defi ned jobs, train-
ing for the job and empowerment of workers to achieve quality standards and then exceed
them through their efforts. Worker&rsquo;s participation in experiments for improvement needs
encouragement from the management with built-in checks such that the experiments do not
adversely affect customer satisfaction.
<p>2. ABC analysis: Customers give different weightage to the facilities provided in a hotel, like
restaurants, health clubs, shopping malls and business centres. Hotels must understand which
areas are of utmost importance to the customers and pay due attention to these areas. For a
resort hotel, for example, the health club will have priority over the business centre.
<p>3. Revenue generation: Revenue can be generated by making the more important areas easily
accessible to the customers by, for example, increasing the hours for which the health club and
shopping mall are open, adding tables in restaurants, giving incentives like one free drink on
visiting the bar.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management210
<p>4. Personalisation of service: A personal touch is given to services rendered by addressing guests
by their names, helping them fi nd the address and phone numbers of their friends in town,
arranging for tickets for evening shows and the like.
<p>The service industry has both direct and indirect buyers. Direct buyers would include user buyers,
like restaurant guests, while indirect buyers would be travel agents for hotels, or doctors for hospitals.
The service provider has to make special efforts to form and maintain relationships with the indirect
buyers. Besides, the opinion leaders play a major role in buyers&rsquo; decision-making process, for example,
a college computer professor would be responsible for purchase assistance in buying computers.
<p>Critical Success Factors (CSF)
Critical success factors for the service industry are simply the factors that are important for the success
of the fi rm. For a hotel, its location, its ambience, star rating and reputation (brand image) are critical
for its success. For a hospital, the doctors, nursing staff, equipment would be the additional CSFs.
It is important that fi rms develop these factors to the maximum. The CSFs should be customer-related
factors only.
<p>Market Segment
Product usage depends on its positioning, which in turn depends on the segment of the market it is
catering to. In times of severe competition, fi rms tend to select a niche market where the competition
is minimal and the fi rm can develop its strategy for gaining a sustainable competitive advantage
through critical success factors. Market research can help fi rms in deciding the market segment they
should be looking at. Market research provides information about the product attributes and the
benefi ts the customers seek from the product in different segments.
<p>Product Pricing
As in the case of products, service pricing is dependent on the level of competition in the locality and
the industry. The selling price is considered a function of competition as follows:
<p>Selling price (SP) = a &times; b &times; c &times; d &times; f (competition)
<p>Where a is the cost of production, b is the seasonal effect on business, c is the customer value
to the fi rm, d is the promotion plans and f is the function, as selling price is also a function of
competition.
<p>Customer Value Analysis
<p>Customer value analysis can be done in different ways depending on the service being sold and the
market segment it is catering to. For example, the hotel industry can have two different kinds of guests, </p>

<p>one who comes once a year, stays for a week, does not eat at the hotel or use any of its facilities, and
another customer who visits every month, spends large amounts in throwing parties in the hotel, uses
all its facilities and runs up bills amounting to thousands of rupees every year. While the customer
is supposed to be king, it should be understood which one is a king, which one an emperor and
who is a prince. One should not, however, forget that today&rsquo;s prince could be tomorrow&rsquo;s emperor
and no one can afford to neglect a customer. The customer value analysis helps in making special
price-cum-promotion packages for the top buyers to increase their business with the fi rm. Another
example is mobile phones. One user may pay the monthly rental, and return calls from a land phone.
Another buyer may use the mobile phone throughout the day and make national and international
calls, running up a monthly bill worth hundreds of thousands of rupees.
<p>The customer value analysis for a fi ve-star hotel can be determined using the following matrix
(see Table 9.3):

<p>Type of guest

<p>suite

<p>club

<p>Business traveller

<p>Similarly for other service products matrix can be made to assess the CVA.
<p>Management of Complaints
In spite of the best intentions and efforts of the service provider, sometimes events and situations
occur that make the customer unhappy. Prompt redress of complaints adds to the relationship, which
the fi rm is trying to establish with the customer. The fi rm needs a defence mechanism to not only counter
the cause of unhappiness but to convert the situation to its own advantage and thus help in improving the
relationship. The task is tough but with sagacity and timely action it can be accomplished and the fi rm
is more than likely to retain the customer and his goodwill. International buyers accept the novelty in
service and yet will not accept any discomfort to themselves arising out of the &lsquo;unique&rsquo; service.
<p>Checking into a hotel might take a long time; a free welcome drink helps take away any unhappiness
about the delay in most cases. In a restaurant, if guests are unhappy with the food served or the delay in
service, the restaurant manager can offer complementary desserts to the guests. What happened
in a hotel&rsquo;s restaurant is narrated next:
<p>One busy evening six guests came and ordered food. When the food arrived, the host among
the guests started shouting at the waiter that the food he had brought was not the one ordered
by the party. As the waiter was sure of the order, he kept arguing that he had brought the
right order and if he were to take it back the cost of the order would be debited to his account.
A verbal duel continued with none accepting that they were in the wrong. At this point of time,
the manager walked in. He told the waiter that of course the guest was right and he rebuked
the waiter for wasting the guests&rsquo; precious time. He asked the waiter to go to the manager&rsquo;s
room and called another waiter, ordered six special meals on-the-house. The six, it turned </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management212
<p>out, had started a big industry in the town and from that time onwards they became regular
patrons of the hotel, throwing lavish parties and entertaining their clients at the same hotel,
bringing big business for it. However, the story would be incomplete unless what happened to
the errant waiter is told. In his room the manager told him, &lsquo;Yes, of course, you were right, but
they are the guests. Go home today and take Rs 100 from the cashier, enjoy with your family
on our account.&rsquo;
The manager, in one stroke, made the guests his friends and did not displease the waiter either,
as good relations with employees are as important as maintaining good customer relations.
<p>Response to Customer Complaints
While the service provider believes that the response to complaints must be prompt and satisfactory,
in reality it is different as can be seen from the following:
<p>1. On a holiday cruise a couple had booked a two-berth cabin with provision for a baby cot for
their infant child, who was a free passenger. The travel agent forgot to tell the shipping company
about the child and at the port the couple was almost thrown out of the ship with a message
that there was no booking for the child. When questioned, the travel agency just turned their
face saying it would not happen again.
<p>2. A car bought by a friend started giving trouble from the fi rst month of its purchase. The
dealer did not respond to letters, phone calls and personal visits till the guarantee period was
almost up. Only a letter sent to the CEO of the fi rm brought the dealer running for prompt
repairs.
<p>3. An international passenger was downgraded from business class to economy class for no
reason. The fl ight attendants kept saying that as soon as the fl ight took off, the passenger would
get back his seat in the business class. The passenger noticed that some rowdy passengers
were transferred to business class, but he was not. A written complaint was sent to the CEO.
An apology was rendered but it sounded hollow to the aggrieved passenger.
<p>4. An irate airline passenger was given gift hampers of sweets instead of the complaint register
for which he had made a request to the fl ight attendant.
<p>Handling Complaints
A customer who has a grievance against the service being provided to him should be handled with
kid gloves. One fi rm hires retired employees of the level of vice president to receive complaints; the
customers feel satisfi ed that a vice president of the fi rm has heard their complaint. The vice president&rsquo;s
job is only to pass on the complaint to the service-engineering department, and for this half-day job
he is paid an honorarium. In essence, the fi rst point of receipt of complaint is extremely important.
The customer satisfaction chain of complaint handling is given next:
<p>1. Communication link needs to be established between the customer and the fi rm&rsquo;s fi rst point of
contact. Subsequently, and quickly, the complaint should be sent to the complaint handler in
the technical department.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing of Services 213
<p>2. Prioritisation of complaints need to be looked at from the customer&rsquo;s viewpoint and he should
be kept informed at every stage of the progress of complaint redress.
<p>3. There should be adequate authority in the fi eld if fi nance is involved so that fi nancial approvals
from the head offi ce do not delay the redress and are also not made an excuse for delays.
<p>4. A sympathetic, pleasant voice should be used by the complaint handler. Use of a gruff voice
might make things worse.
<p>5. The customer&rsquo;s inconvenience during the redress stage should be limited to the minimum
possible if the fi rm wants repeat business from the customer.
<p>Assessment of Complaints
<p>Firms should understand the nature of complaints, the recurrence levels and fi nd permanent solutions.
In case of high incidence of a particular problem (a complaint becomes a problem if left unattended),
a quick resolution of the same is required. If the problem does not occur frequently and yet it is of
grave consequences to the fi rm, it needs to be sorted out as soon as possible.
<p>In case the problem appears minor to the management, it is better to take a customers&rsquo; poll on it,
as their perception could be totally different. Minor irritants should be solved with speed, as they
could become major problems in times to come. However, only isolated inconsequential problems
can be put on the backburner.
<p>Guarantee of Service
<p>In one hotel in Bangalore, if the guest does not get his breakfast within 10 minutes of ordering room
service, he does not have to pay for it. To achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, fi rms strive
for some unique selling proposition. While most products and most innovations can be copied, it is
not so easy to copy the service being provided by the service provider. Some airlines started showing
movies on fl ights and soon this became the norm on every fl ight. However, can the genuine smile
of a fl ight attendant and his concern for the comfort of the passengers ever be copied? And yet,
airlines have massive training programmes to ensure at least minimum courtesy service, which is
better than the best offered by the competition. Airlines believe in standardisation in the manner in
which service is provided like how the tea and coffee are to be served, how the cold drinks are to be
offered, how the safety rules are to be demonstrated and even how the passengers are to be greeted
on embarking on their journey. Even then, passengers have their favourite airlines.
<p>Some providers of service place their guarantee certifi cates in inaccessible places, which cannot
be read or seen by the customers. Others put a lot of safeguards in the fi ne print, which are almost
illegible to the naked eye. Guarantee certifi cates should be written clearly, they should be accessible to the
customers and simple to execute to become part of a fi rm&rsquo;s image-building activity, which brings in customers
for repeat service.
<p>Providing guarantees costs money to the fi rm. However, the money is usefully deployed if it can
generate profi table business as can be seen from Figure 9.1.</p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management214
<p>Figure 9.1 Brand Equity and Profi tability
<p>Firms operate for profi table growth and that can be achieved through improvement in brand equity
and word of mouth publicity.
<p>Customer Satisfaction to Customer Delight
<p>Service fi rms need to know the level of satisfaction their customer have before they can even think of
customer delight. What irritates customers can be summed up as follows:
<p>1. Long wait for service: Barbers provide magazines to waiting customers.
2. Wait while the service is being provided: One car workshop has started a restaurant, library
<p>and video parlour for customers who have to wait while their car is being serviced.
3. Flight delays: Beyond a period, the airlines provide meals/snacks, depending on the time of
<p>the day.
4. Long wait for food in a restaurant: Free non-alcoholic drinks and titbits help to keep waiting
<p>customers patient.
4. Super markets provide cr&egrave;che facilities for small kids that enable mothers to shop in peace.
<p>Customer delight comes from surprise packages. In several restaurants, if they know that one of
the guests is celebrating his or her birthday, they provide a birthday cake with compliments of the
management. Honeymooners get delighted if their room in the hotel is upgraded to a suite or at least
to an isolated area. Customer delight is a powerful tool to excite word of mouth publicity.
<p>When a traveller lands up in a foreign country to fi nd no car or cab waiting for him, no reservation
in the hotel where his secretary had confi rmed his booking, his nightmare seems to have started. Then
comes the hotel manager who personally calls a nearby equally good hotel, takes him there, gets him
settled in before going back to his hotel and the nightmare disappears. The traveller is sure to go home
and talk highly about the hotel manager.
<p>Service Product Market Research
<p>While planning a new fi ve-star hotel in one designated locality, initially a secondary research would
help in formulating new hotel plans. The information could be obtained from the records, balance
sheets of other existing hotels in the area like:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing of Services 215
<p>1. Year-round room occupancy rate, with built-in seasonality effect, if any.
2. Popularity and consequent revenue of the various restaurants in the hotels, the type of cuisine
<p>preferred by the customers.
3. Usage of health clubs and business centres in the hotels.
4. Location advantage of the hotels.
5. Popularity of banquets in the hotels.
6. Any other salient feature which accounts for the success of a hotel.
7. Brand image of the hotels.
<p>Besides existing hotels, the research should focus on process and service delivery improvement.
Second, an assessment should be made to fi nd out the result of previous process improvements.
The research should determine what really clicks with the customers, what makes for the difference
between success and failure.
<p>Most restaurants and hotels have request forms to be fi lled by guests where they are asked to give
their views and ratings to the various services provided. Once a month, these forms are analysed to
fi nd out the true worth of the place in the customers&rsquo; mind.
<p>Market surveys or customer assessments are regular continuous features in the hospitality in-
dustry. Therefore these must have the full support of the top management for them to be of use to the
industry. The survey must have a clear-cut objective as vague ideas cannot bring the expected results.
The best way is to identify the critical success factors of the industry and defi ne the objectives on their
basis. Afterwards, secondary or primary research or both can be planned as per the need. Once the
research results are available they should be analysed and put to effective use otherwise the entire
exercise of the research goes waste. If, for example, the research was meant to assess the processes
after the research the process improvement should be planned on its basis.
<p>Telecom fi rms in the private sector have started consumer research to constantly assess the cus-
tomer acceptance factor for the services offered by them. Research on attitude formation and the
benefi ts sought by the customers are carried out through focus groups and fi eld research. From most
researches it has been found that in similar services, for example, fi ve-star hotels, the quality of service
plays a major role in the fi rm&rsquo;s market share and that in turn affects the return on investment. Quality
does not always increase the cost. In several cases, quality helps in reducing high rejections and better
acceptance of the services offered, which reduce the costs.

<p>10 International Strategic Marketing
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
With changes taking place in the international marketplace, marketers have two choices in front of
them, either they can react to the situations or they can become proactive, on which count they have
to take the initiative of planning and implementing their plans for maintaining and even increasing
their market share and brand equity. International markets are cruel and they do not forgive delays
in decision-making. This chapter will help the students in fi ne-tuning their marketing skills that would
enable them in fi ghting global competitions.</p>

<p>International Marketing Management218
<p>INTRODUCTION
<p>Strategic marketing is the key to present-day market planning for the following reasons:
<p>1. Firms have to make their selections based on various strategic options.
2. The business environment is constantly changing, calling for timely decisions.
3. A long-range view is required instead of fi re-fi ghting plans.
4. Strategic analysis is needed to grasp the real issues facing the markets.
5. Resource allocation needs to be planned to ensure that unfruitful tasks are eliminated from the
<p>allocations.
6. Both horizontal and vertical communication and control systems should be in place.
7. Strategic marketing should help in keeping business ahead of competition during the market
<p>change phases.
8. To examine these points from the Indian point of view.
<p>Firms keep introducing new products. Product variants and timing of the introduction is of strategic
importance, as wrong timing could result in a disastrous product launch. Wrong selection of market
segment, distribution channels or pricing could lead to launch failures.
<p>Manufacturing in India can be categorised as follows:
<p>1. Large scale
2. Medium scale
3. Small scale
4. Cottage industry
5. Cooperative sector
<p>Differentiation can also be made on the basis of the nature of competition as follows:
<p>1. Monopoly&mdash;where there is only one manufacturer of the product.
2. Oligopoly&mdash;where there are only a limited number of manufacturers, say four to six, of the
<p>product.
3. Fragmented market&mdash;in which case there are a large number of manufacturers of the product.
4. Structured fragmented&mdash;for several products like computers and air conditioners, there are two
<p>categories of manufacturers, the branded ones and the unbranded ones in the unrecognised or
small-scale sector, with several players in each group.
<p>Marketing strategy should be made taking into account the actual ground situation, considering
the types of manufacturing units that are in competition and their actual numbers. The business en-
vironment can be categorised as general business environment and competitive business environment.
It is necessary to understand the business environment and the competitive situations for developing
right strategies. The next step is to analyse the situation before planning the marketing strategies. Both
external and internal analyses need to be done.
<p>External analysis: Most of the things regarding which a fi rm needs information, lie outside of it
like:
<p>1. The market and its relevant segment.
2. The customer.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 219
<p>3. The competitor.
4. The business environment.
<p>Internal analysis would involve analysing:
<p>1. The fi rm&rsquo;s performance.
2. Its policy and plans.
3. Its objectives and deviations between objectives and performance.
4. Resource allocation for achieving the objectives in the future before planning marketing
<p>strategies.
<p>Products and markets correlate as per the following matrix shown in Table 10.1.
<p>Table 10.1 Product&ndash;Market Correlation
<p>Markets Existing products New products
<p>Present market Market penetration Product expansion

<p>Similarly matrix given in Table 10.2 shows the correlation between competition and markets:

Market extension Promotion plans Price and promotion
<p>Strategic marketing is all about gaining competitive advantage on a continuous basis and fi nding
out the strategies that will give you such a competitive advantage. Let us call it strategic competitive
advantage. For planning strategic competitive advantage, the following method is used:
<p>1. Plan the business scenario, and the shape and size of the market, likely after three and fi ve
years.
<p>2. Plan your market share on the basis of feasibility.
3. Resources including cash fl ow need to be utilised for maximising the chances of achieving the
<p>objectives.
4. Focus on core competencies of the fi rm and synergise efforts for fully exploiting them.
<p>The core competencies of a fi rm are:
<p>1. Technology&mdash;does it give the fi rm a cutting edge?
2. Marketing&mdash;is the fi rm proactive in the market place and can it take full advantage of the
<p>business potential available in the market?
3. Finance&mdash;is the fi rm able to generate suffi cient funds for growth and expansion?</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management220
<p>4. Production&mdash;can the fi rm&rsquo;s cost to manufacture, including its time dimension, be compared to
that of the competition, and is the fi rm fi nding ways of reducing cost of manufacture by going
in for economies of scale and experience curve?
<p>5. Human resource&mdash;is the fi rm&rsquo;s personnel geared to think and plan their every move for the
benefi t of the customer?
<p>6. Government relations&mdash;does the fi rm maintain good and healthy relations with the government
of the host country and does it avoid being at loggerheads with the government all the time?
Can the fi rm get government approvals at short notice?
<p>Once the fi rm gets the answers to these questions it is ready to take the following strategic
decisions:
<p>1. Who should be considered the fi rm&rsquo;s main competitors?
2. Where should the fi rm compete? In which markets, geographic areas and niche markets?
3. How should the fi rm compete? On the basis of price? Or quality? Superior service? Availability
<p>of genuine spare parts?
4. What are the areas in which information is lacking and is needed? Is a one time market research
<p>required or should there be a continuous fl ow of information?
5. Multiple uses of the product should be exploited. Bundling of products can help in selling
<p>slow-moving products at least to a degree.
6. Firms should plan the business scenario for the next three to fi ve years taking into consider-
<p>ation it&rsquo;s competitors&rsquo; plans and possible likely changes in the business environment.
<p>Strategic marketing decisions are discussed next:
<p>1. With international players coming to India, technology is going to change rapidly. Indian fi rms
would do well to either invest in research and development or purchase the latest state-of-the-
art technology to keep abreast of the competition or even forge ahead of them.
<p>2. If the product is in the maturity stage of its life cycle and the demand growth has stagnated, it
may be necessary to go for penetrating pricing to maintain its market share or build its brand
equity to the extent that it can ask for and get a higher price than the competition. Price sensitivity
of the market needs to be understood and decisions on pricing taken accordingly.
<p>3. If new entrants are likely to enter the market with a better product, technology and brand image,
it is necessary to invest in the product and the market by giving extra discounts, increasing
coverage and, if possible, joining hands with a technology leader dealing with that product.
<p>4. The customers of tomorrow are looking for products that give improved performance, have
technical superiority, are easily available and offer fi nancial assistance in the form of a lease.
<p>5. Firms should have correct idea about the benefi ts the customers are seeking from the product.
It is important to keep in mind the fact that a customer does not buy a product, he buys only
the benefi ts that he derives from the product.
<p>PRODUCT RELATED ANALYSIS
<p>It is important to know the product on offer, its detailed specifi cations, both static and dynamic, in
addition to the following:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 221
<p>1. Who are the users of the product, how they buy it, where they buy it, how they buy it and for
how much?
<p>2. How do the customers use the product? Does it have a single use or does it have multiple uses?
How often do the customers use it?
<p>3. What are the benefi ts the customers are looking for in the product? Manufacturers may have
a particular view of these benefi ts while the customers may have an entirely different notion
of what they want. The sellers of washing powder all talk about the whiteness of the wash,
whereas customers never talk about the whiteness of the wash as the reason for buying a par-
ticular detergent powder. The best way to fi nd out about the benefi ts the customers want in a
product is to arrange a market research in the desired market segment.
<p>4. Product pricing is an important aspect of devising a marketing strategy. When a new product is
launched and there is no competition, sellers go for skimming price, in other words, they keep
the price high to get the maximum profi ts before competition starts and they are forced by it
to reduce the prices. If the sellers are looking for increasing market share, they use penetrating
prices, that is, low prices to attract large customer groups. It is important to know if the product
sales are affected by changes in price, that is, price sensitivity of the product must be known
by research.
<p>5. Knowledge about the competition is needed on a continuous basis as regularly new competi-
tion keeps increasing and the existing competition keeps changing their plans and policies. It
is necessary to know the competitors&rsquo; 4Ps. This knowledge should be updated regularly.
<p>6. Brand loyalty/equity of the product of the fi rm and those of the competitors should be assessed
well, as it is the single most important factor responsible for market share.
<p>7. Market survey is required to fi nd out the rate of product need in different market segments.
Which segment has the highest per cent demand of the product and which segments follow
the demand pattern must be known. Sub-segments, niche segments and crossover segment
demand must be assessed. Only after this knowledge is available, can the seller decide as to
which segment or niche market to enter.
<p>The airline industry has found that they have basically two types of customers:
<p>1. Business: Customers of this class want an air service that is reliable, on schedule, with wide-body
aircrafts and offers fl ights from easy to use airports with comfortable lounges, frequent-fl ier
programmes, telephone check-ins, connections between a wide range of cities, in-fl ight enter-
tainment and possible upgrades from business class to fi rst class.
<p>2. Tourists: These are customers who look for low-price travel, airlines that suit their schedules
and offer several stopovers. They do not mind travelling at night for the sake of low prices.
They look for package deals in which air tickets and hotel accommodations are included.
<p>Such details can only be found by getting proper market research done.
<p>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
<p>Next, let us look at the analysis to be done for the competitors. The fi rm must know who its competitors
are. Most fi rms have direct and indirect competitors. The study of competitors is most useful if it is </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management222
<p>done with a customer-based approach. Once the fi rm has identifi ed its direct competitors, it is useful
to evaluate each of the competitors on the following parameters:
<p> 1. What are the fi rm&rsquo;s business goals and objectives?
2. What is the commitment level of the managers and stakeholders of the fi rm?
3. How do the managers of the fi rm view its growth prospects? Have they at any time considered
<p>its closure? What are the barriers to its exiting from the business?
4. What is its cost structure, fi nancial structure, cash fl ow position and what are its assets and
<p>liabilities.
5. How do the fi rm&rsquo;s suppliers, fi nanciers and distribution system view it?
6. What is its track record of meeting its fi nancial commitments and other obligations?
7. Are their product specifi cations in line with Indian standards? Can they meet world standards
<p>or not?
8. How are their international business dealings? Are they importing and exporting or are they
<p>involved in only one of the two?
9. Where have they positioned their product&mdash;is it up-market or for the masses? Is the product
<p>pricing in line with their product positioning?
10. Are their advertising and promotional efforts congruent with their product positioning?
11. How is the fi rm&rsquo;s public relations effort rated?
12. How is the fi rm&rsquo;s brand equity rated?
13. What are the fi rm&rsquo;s core competencies?
14. What are the fi rm&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses?
15. What are the fi rms unmet needs as far as the customers are concerned? Unmet needs arise
<p>out of customer dissatisfaction with a product or customer problems. There are unmet needs
of which the customer is aware and there are some of which the customers may not be even
aware. Competitors take advantage by advertising their own met needs and pointing out the
unmet needs of their competitors.
<p>It is useful to do a SWOT analysis at this stage for each of the competitors.
Table 10.3 sums up the different types of analyses:

<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 223
<p>decisions. For example, the capabilities of a fi rm could include its fi nancial strength and marketing
base and its constraints could be lack of motivation in the personnel. The analysis should take the
core competencies into account.
<p>STRATEGIC MARKETING PLANNING PROCESS
<p>Let us understand the formal process needed for planning marketing strategies in today&rsquo;s competi-
tive age. Plans made should be for the short-term and the long term. Most fi rms make annual plans,
which are divided into quarterly plans. To be entirely market proactive, the plans should be kept
fl exible to enable fi rms to alter them according to the changing market environment. The following
steps are needed for making the plans:
<p>1. Analysis of the external environment.
2. Study of the fi rm&rsquo;s internal strengths and weaknesses.
3. Idea generation for planning.
4. Brainstorming for prioritising the ideas generated.
5. Customer behaviour analysis.
6. Competitors&rsquo; analysis.
7. Market analysis.
8. Draft annual and short-term plan.
9. Final plans with forecast of sales and cash fl ow.
<p>Customer&rsquo;s Analysis
<p>We have discussed earlier why, how, where, when and how much the customers buy, which can be
ascertained with a degree of accuracy through market research. Let us take a simple customer
behaviour pattern. It includes the following elements of internal information processing, guided by
external information and stimuli:
<p>1. Belief: It is the customer&rsquo;s conviction and fi rm opinion of a product/brand.
2. Perception: It comes from a customer&rsquo;s recognition of a product as a desirable one based on his
<p>intuition and information gathered on the sensory plane.
3. Attitude: It is the customer&rsquo;s way of thinking about the product, his fi rm opinion about it.
4. Preference: Out of his belief, perception and attitude, the customer develops preference for one
<p>product over another and tries to buy it.
<p>Thus we can defi ne the multi-attribute decision-making process as, &lsquo;based on concepts of Beliefs,
Attitudes, Perceptions and Preferences&rsquo; which is the notion that objects in a choice set can lead to
external behaviour. Each object in the set has a value on each attribute used to defi ne the choice set.
<p>Let us take an example to illustrate the point. The purchase of a car in a family is a major event
and the decision-making process is a multidimensional one. While fi lm stars buy cars as status
symbols, middle-class people buy it as a means of transport only. Let us take four cars in the economy </p>

<p>segment and plot their benefi ts to the customer. (The fi gures given in Table 10.4 are arbitrary and
not conclusive.)
<p>Table 10.4 Benefi t Rating for Cars
<p>Benefi ts Zen Santro Matiz
<p>Comfort 7.5 8 8.5
Economy 4 5 6
Safety 3.8 4.5 5
Brand equity 4 7 6
Service facilities 9 6 5
<p>Note: The fi gures are based on a scale from 0&ndash;10.
<p>On a different plane, another matrix can be made with benefi ts on one axis and decision-making
concepts for each car separately, before the fi nal decision is taken as follows (Table 10.5):
<p>Table 10.5 Decision Concepts and Benefi ts
<p>Decision concepts/Benefi ts Comfort Economy Safety Brand equity
<p>Beliefs
Attitudes
Perceptions
Preferences
<p>It calls for a three-dimensional matrix (through a combination of Tables 10.4 and 10.5), which
would help the decision makers. This is done in the steps as discussed next:
<p>1. Which attributes are used to defi ne the product? (For example, for a car it could be its brand
name, comfort or economy. For a house it could be its location, its construction and area.)
<p>2. What is the possession level of the attributes in the product? (Is the car more economical as com-
pared to another car in the same category.) This is really the value of the attribute, its perception
in the customer&rsquo;s mind. Another example could be of an airline, where passenger safety is of
prime concern. However, airlines never talk about the safety aspect as all airlines are supposed to
be safe. They prefer to talk about the ease of getting tickets, in-fl ight service, food, entertainment
and easy check-in facilities. And customers form attitudes on the basis of these attributes.
<p>3. What is the relative importance of each attribute in the overall product performance? For
example, while choosing airlines, is the customer more interested in in-fl ight service or in ease
of getting tickets?
<p>4. Do the customers weigh each of the attributes to reinforce their perceptions of overall product
performance? How much weightage is given to each of the attributes and does it differ from
customer to customer or is it product specifi c?1
<p>1 At this stage students should do an attributes&ndash;perception study for different products to fi nd out how the
customer&rsquo;s perceptions and preferences are formed in the Indian context. The same study can be made with
international customers in mind.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 225
<p>It will be found that different customers have separate yardsticks for looking at the attributes.
They trade-off one against the other while making the purchase decisions as can be seen from the
following example. Some people buy car only for its brand name, for example the Mercedes; some buy
a car for its speed and power. Yet others buy the car for its mileage only. Some look for several of the
attributes in some descending order of their importance. This is called the dictionary rule, according to
which if a customer fi nds two products having the fi rst or the most important attribute to be equally
present in both products, he then looks for disparity at the next level. The customer keeps doing so
till he arrives at an attribute where there is a difference in the two products. (When you look for a
word in the dictionary you fi rst look for the fi rst alphabet in the word and then the second and so on
till you fi nd the exact word.) While buying a car, would the customer prefer a lower price or a better
mileage? Can the seller charge Rs 100,000 more if the car gives 8 km more per litre?
<p>Multi-attribute analysis helps sellers understand customers who represent identifi able segments
in terms of their perceptions and preferences.
<p>Let us consider the levels of competition, or competitor&rsquo;s hierarchy. A competitor can be defi ned
as a seller who competes for the same customer rupee at the widest competition level. Narrowing it
down, a competitor is one who sells the same products from the same industry. A further narrower
defi nition of competitor would be the market segment competitors.
<p>To clarify this let us take the banking business. The fi rst level would be the banking system, which
would include banks, fi nancial institutions, non-banking fi nancial institutions, merchant bankers and
moneylenders. The second level would be a bank that caters to the customers with a few banking
products. The third level is a bank in the same town or on the same street as it closes to the customer
more directly than the fi rst two levels.
<p>Competition is becoming diversifi ed as can be seen from the following:
<p>1. Banking services have competition from software companies now, as a lot of online internet
banking is being done with the help of relevant software.
<p>2. Used cars compete with the new cars.
<p>It is therefore possible to defi ne competition by analysing data on the customer. To do this the
seller must take the following steps:
<p>1. Defi ne a product.
2. Let the prospective customers decide the possible uses and benefi ts, as many as they can
<p>imagine the product to possess. Customers can be asked to think of other ways of getting the
same benefi ts. In this way fi rms can get differential competitive analysis from the customer&rsquo;s
viewpoint.
<p>3. The customers should determine the benefi ts that accrue from the use of the product.
4. The data thus obtained can be listed with priority as given by the customers.
<p>The data thus obtained will provide the fi rm the information on the competitors for each product
in their range.
<p>In summary it can be said that competitor&rsquo;s analysis requires the prudent use of secondary and
primary information to determine current and likely strategies. Customers can be employed to classify
uses and benefi ts of products and to rank the competitors.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management226
<p>Let us see the assets and skills grid for competitors. These can be divided into two parts as
follows:
<p>1. Primary: These include product development, product quality, product manufacturing cost,
product differentiation, customer satisfaction and market share.
<p>2. Secondary: These include fl exi-production, fi nancial muscle, sales force, distribution network,
brand image/equity, advertising and promotion, quality of service and growth of the market
for the product.
<p>Discussion Points for Students
1. Explain the principle of multi-attribute analysis.
2. Give the broad and narrow defi nition of competition.
3. How can a customer help in competitor&rsquo;s analysis?
4. Defi ne unmet needs of the customers with examples.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>Market Analysis
The following need to be understood while analysing the market:
<p>1. Market size, actual and potential.
2. Market growth prospects.
3. Market, product-wise profi tability.
4. Cost structure.
5. Distribution pattern.
6. Success parameters.
<p>Market size and its growth can be assessed by knowing the demographic changes taking place in
the market, income and salary growth of people in the market and changes in government policies
relating to business of the products. In the maturity and decline stage of the product life cycle, the
fi rm has to identify the following points:
<p>1. Price wars start if there is no product differentiation and there is over-capacity in production.
2. Level of buyer&rsquo;s sophistication.
3. Availability of substitution products.
4. Firms have to investigate why there is no growth. They need to see if there is a new competitive
<p>product in the market.
<p>To analyse the profi t picture of a market, the following points need to be seen:
<p>1. The types of competition in the market, that is, is it a monopoly situation, oligopoly or fragmented
market with a vast number of sellers. Market share of the competitors and how they safeguard
it (whether through price-cutting or brand management) needs to be looked into.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 227
<p>2. How many new players are likely to join the competition? How serious are they and what is
their potential threat as a competitor?
<p>3. How strong are the substitute products which vie for the customer&rsquo;s money?
4. Bargaining power of suppliers.
5. Bargaining power of buyers.
6. Firms should know about their competitors&rsquo; number, size, similarity of product, level of fi xed
<p>costs and their exit barriers. For new entrants, the fi rm should know about their requirement
of capital, economies of scale of production, availability of distribution channels, raw materials
and product differentiations.
<p>High growth markets can suffer from over-crowding of players, penetrating prices, technology
changes and resource crunch. Environment analysis makes the fi rm understand the effect of changes
in technology, macroeconomics, government policies, culture, demography and global changes.
<p>SEGMENTATION AND POSITIONING
<p>Segmentation allows fi rms to focus on specifi ed market sets through positioning, to enable fi rms
to launch a unique market programme to stand out among competitors. Segmentation is essential
as the customers have diverse needs and behaviour related to market stimuli. It also helps fi rms as
follows:
<p>1. Planning focused marketing programmes.
2. New product launches.
3. Creating competitive advantage.
<p>How do you segment the customers? Following are the ways of market segmentation:
<p>1. Benefi t to the customers, like better service needs, convenient pricing.
2. Product usage by the customers like heavy usage or light usage.
3. Brand loyalty.
4. Products becomes a status symbol like the Mercedes car.
5. Geographic divisions like the north, south, east and west of the country.
6. Demographic segmentation based on age, income, place of residence, sex and religion.
7. Division based on lifestyle and psychographics.
<p>The customer is king. Let us examine the statement. A guest stays in a hotel once a year and an-
other guest stays six times a year. It is the usage that makes the customer the king or the commoner.
Table 10.6, which shows customer usage of a fi ve-star hotel, helps to illustrate this point:
<p>Table 10.6 Customer Analysis Matrix
<p>Yearly expense in rupees 10,000 25,000 100,000 500,000 1,000,000
<p>Tourists in % 55 20 15 9 1
Business traveller in % 1 9 55 20 15</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management228
<p>It is easy to describe the business traveller who spends Rs 500,000 and above a year as the &lsquo;king&rsquo;.
(Of course, hotels cannot ignore the small customers for it is possible that today&rsquo;s common man may
be a future &lsquo;king&rsquo;. Facilities like room upgrades, free use of gym are meant to keep the &lsquo;king&rsquo; coming
back to the hotel.) Social class too defi nes a business market segment, as people belonging to the same
class tend to spend their money in buying the same things.
<p>BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS OR INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTATION
<p>Industries buy raw materials and components from suppliers. The suppliers segment their customers
as follows:
<p>1. Company size: The larger the company, the more products it is likely to buy and be better
paymasters (as it has to maintain its reputation as a good company). Sometimes medium-sized
companies prove to be good as they are in the process of growing and their reputation is vital
for them.
<p>2. Innovative companies: They have the lead user concept, that is, they want to be the fi rst users
of the product. Small companies have the advantage of being fl exible in their production and
other plans.
<p>The following make a good market segment:
<p>1. The segment should be of adequate size. There should be manageable number of segments.
2. The segments should be concrete with justifi ed measurable base for each segment.
<p>While implementing the segment schemes, it is necessary to combine descriptive variables like age
and income for which data is available, with behaviour and attitude variables. At times, suffi cient
data is not available for making a proper market segment, which is feasible too (market segment
feasibility depends on its size, its uniqueness and homogeneity). There are product-specifi c variables
like, light users and heavy users and then there are general descriptive variables like demographic
and geographic variables. The focus should not, however, shift on just creation of a segment and
segmentation should remain a tool for gaining competitive advantage.
<p>Summarising, it can be said that, markets are segmented to satisfy different customer needs to
leverage as fi rm&rsquo;s advantage in size, location to serve identifi able groups of customers, profi tably.
From segmentation, the fi rm can target the segment or segments by steering its marketing efforts
towards them.
<p>PRODUCT POSITIONING
<p>Product positioning involves focusing on a marketing programme that one-segment customers will
perceive as desirable and which will give the fi rm a differential advantage over the competition.
Usually, there are a number of competitors for the same segment. Positioning gives the fi rm sustainable
competitive advantage because of its customer-specifi c approach. The steps needed are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 229
<p>1. To identify relevant competition.
2. To draw the differential benefi ts and attributes signifi cant to the segment where the fi rm scores
<p>better than the competition.
3. Delineate the fi rm and its competitors&rsquo; current position.
4. Defi ne segments preferred attribute combinations.
5. Select positioning strategy.
6. Communicate the position.
<p>Discussion Points for Students
1. Steps in the Positioning Process.
2. Importance of communicating the difference between the fi rm and its competitors&rsquo; product
<p>benefi ts and attributes. Does the fi rm have a position if the customer does not know about it?
<p>In a nutshell, it can be said that:
<p>1. Segmentation allows fi rms to identify a potentially profi table group of customers.
2. Positioning requires fi rms to identify the right competitors and differentiate their products and
<p>other 4Ps, and then effectively communicate the unique benefi ts of these products to the target
customers.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>MANAGING ACROSS THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE (PLC)
<p>With a lot of effort going into new product development, fi rms have the benefi t of introducing new
products at some point of time. It is important that care is taken in managing the introduction of the
new product to ensure profi ts and volume business. Later, during the growth, maturity and decline
stages of the product life cycle (PLC), proper management is required. Figure 10.1 gives the different
stages of the PLC.
<p>Figure 10.1 Product Life Cycle (PLC)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management230
<p>INTRODUCTORY STAGE
<p>The introductory stage is gaining importance by the day as, due to the faster rate of obsolescence
in the case of most products, the PLC is shrinking. New technologies are emerging in several products
to make earlier product obsolete. Firms need to capture maximum market in this stage, and as mostly
there is little competition, they can charge skimming prices to get the maximum revenue. Main con-
ditions in the introductory stage are as follows:
<p>1. Growth is slow as the customers are not aware of the product and its concept. A lot of concept
selling is required before actual volume business starts. At this stage the product itself is not well
defi ned. The channels of distribution are also new, but since they have customers coming to them
for other products, they hold the key to business and have the power over the manufacturers.
In this phase, as far as price is concerned, the rules of the game have not yet been fi nalised.
Advertising gives most of the information to competitors about the products, price, channels
of distribution and its market segment as thought out by the fi rm.
<p>2. Only fi rst introduction fi rms (fi rms that bring a product for the fi rst time to customers) have
some advantage, and other leaders and followers are not signifi cant at this stage.
<p>3. Penetrating prices are charged for gaining and maintaining the market share. With low prices,
the fi rms spend good money on advertising and promotion. For profi ts, they depend on volume
business and economies of scale in manufacturing.
<p>4. Skimming price is used when competition is yet far away. The customer base is narrow and
fi rms prefer not to spend a lot of money on advertising and promotion. For profi ts, fi rms depend
on high prices and low expenses.
<p>5. In case of skimming prices, competition comes in fast as they see the large margins of profi ts.
6. Penetrating prices keep competition away for quite some time.
<p>As can be seen, the pioneering fi rms have the task of developing the market through concept selling
and advertising, and the fi rms that follow get the benefi t of their efforts. For example, suppose a fi rm
introduces computers in an underdeveloped market, it will do concept selling by telling the customers
about the advantages of using a computer. They will not be able to talk about their brand say, IBM.
Sellers who enter the market later, like, say for example, Compaq, will be able to build on the concept
acceptance of the customers and they can advertise their brand and generate brand awareness, brand
loyalty and brand equity.
<p>Summarising, market pioneers managing the introductory stage of PLC, can pursue a strategy to
capture a narrow customer base with skimming prices for extra profi ts or they can plan on a broad
market base with penetrating pricing.
<p>Discussion Points for Students
1. What are the benefi ts and negative points of penetrating and skimming pricing policies?
2. What are some of the characteristics of the introductory stage of PLC?
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 231
<p>In the early growth stage of a PLC, market growth increases and the distinction between leaders
and followers also grows. Product quality stabilises and the fi rm&rsquo;s dependence on channels reduces.
Hence, the power of channels also reduces giving way to advertising and promotions, besides personal
selling by the fi rm&rsquo;s salespersons.
<p>Hence, it can be concluded that the different stages in PLC are identifi able and they require dis-
tinct marketing skills at each stage, especially at the introductory stage, when both failure-risk and
product&ndash;costs are high, quality often uneven and market acceptance is not fully assured.
<p>Second, marketers have a choice of pricing the product in the introductory stage. They can either
have widespread business with penetrating prices and market share or can opt to gain high unit
profi ts with skimming prices.
<p>COSTS, VOLUMES AND EXPERIENCE CURVE
<p>Let us discuss how important costs, volumes and experience curve are in our strategies for marketing.
Marketing strategies are needed to balance core competencies of a fi rm with changes in the business
environment that take place constantly and are essential for the long-term well-being and growth of
the fi rm. The basics of marketing are good strategies. Strategy needs an analysis of the fi rm, the com-
petition and customers in a dynamically changing business environment.
<p>Let us discuss the market leadership position a fi rm can enjoy. For getting volumes needed for leader-
ship, the fi rm has to have penetrating prices. Hence, there is a cost of leadership, by way of reduced
profi t on unit product basis. In order to reduce the loss in profi t, the following need to be done:
<p>1. Integrating marketing and production plans.
2. Making an objective of high volume and low-cost production as a result.
3. Focus on market share.
4. Gain cost leadership.
<p>Cost leadership is gained through the following methods:
<p>1. Technological advancements.
2. Inputs from suppliers and customers for streamlining cost elements in manufacture.
3. Economies of scale, which help in reducing the fi xed costs, as for larger production rentals, super-
<p>visor&rsquo;s salary and other overheads do not change and hence, unit fi xed cost gets reduced.
4. Experience curve, which helps in reducing variable costs, as with the passage of time, workers
<p>get to know the work better and wastage gets reduced, and production time also shortens.
With increase in cumulative workers&rsquo; experience in production, workers do better. This is most
valid in high-labour cost industries, complex assembly line operations and production of high
numbers of standard products, which helps workers as the work is repetitive.
<p>Experience curve cost reduction comes from the following areas:
<p>1. Labour effi ciency.
2. Work specialisation and improvement in methods.
3. New production processes.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management232
<p>It has been observed that experience improves performance from production equipment,
changes in resource mix and material substitution. It helps in product standardisation and redesign.
Experience effect results from the fi rm&rsquo;s attempt to achieve lower relative costs than the competition.
Low-cost production gives the highest profi t margins.
<p>MARKET SHARE STRATEGY
<p>International fi rms are constantly striving to improve their market share. For this purpose the following
strategies are planned:
<p>1. Plan large capacity production, which will help in achieving economies of scale of production
to reduce the fi xed costs as it would help in both domestic and overseas markets.
<p>2. Penetrating or aggressive pricing policy helps in getting a larger market-share as more cus-
tomers who are price conscious buy the product. Initially, to gain a foothold in the market, sellers
resort to selling on marginal costs only where they put the price equal to the fi xed cost plus a
little element of variable cost. Once the market share is reached as planned and brand loyalty
gained from some customers, the price is increased to include both fi xed and variable cost and
some profi t margin is also added to it. This is especially true for price-sensitive segments of
the market. The idea is to lower the price and in a way invest in future growth of the market.
It can rebound if the market does not grow at all.
<p>Let us discuss some successful cases of experience curve effect:
<p>1. Manufacture of semiconductor devices, including integrated circuits (ICs): Initially the rejection
rate used to be high, up to 50 per cent. As the fi rms got experience in manufacturing, the workers
could reduce the rejections, and today, the rejections are less than 1 per cent. It has resulted in
price reductions of not only these components, but also of the fi nal electronic equipments.
<p>2. Honda motorcycles reduced prices substantially (in seven years, the reduction in price was
US$ 100 due to the effect of the experience curve).
<p>The risks involved with gaining cost reduction through experience curve are:
<p>1. Manufacturers base their production plan as per the market forecasts. In case the demand
projections prove to be wrong and demand fails to come to the anticipated levels, the cost
reductions become void, as then the production is tailored to the real demand only.
<p>2. Customer&rsquo;s tastes keep changing, especially with regard to fashion garments where the rate of
obsolescence is high.
<p>3. Induction of new technology in manufacturing also reduces the effect of the experience
curve.
<p>4. Ego or other fi xation on old manufacturing processes. Firms can argue that they have spent a
lot of money on an old technology and they cannot abandon it so soon. Such a mindset might
harm the growth of a fi rm, and also reduce the benefi ts of experience, as with new technology
the fi rm can achieve an even better manufacturing cost.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 233
<p>Tasks for Students
1. What are the factors responsible for reduction in costs once the sales volumes increase?
2. Can managers price products in anticipation of increases in volume sales?
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>Summarising, it can be said that:
<p>1. Cost leadership is a powerful strategic tool where learning curve and economies of scale provide
higher profi ts and better market share than that of the competitors.
<p>2. Economies of scale and learning curve effects must fulfi l market needs. The fi rm must have the
resources to fi nance the more effective operations.
<p>PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE&mdash;GROWTH STAGE STRATEGY
Marketing strategies are needed at every stage of the PLC to combat the market realities and the
options available, as the relationship of the fi rm and that of its competitors with the customers keeps
changing all the time.
<p>Early growth involves large increases in volumes and an increasing number of competitors as
market players use advertising to build brand equity to elevate their market share and position. The
following changes take place:
<p>1. Sales volumes increase rapidly.
2. Competition rises.
3. Product design and specifi cations get standardised.
4. Firms plan their advertising and sales efforts to gain brand superiority.
5. Prices may start their downward slide.
6. Distribution network gets into place and power over customers begins to move towards
<p>manufacturers from the channel members.
7. Demand shifts from primary demand, say for a PC or a car to secondary demand, for example,
<p>a Wipro PC or a Honda City car, as people/customers become brand conscious.
8. At times, the pioneer who started the sale of the product and did the initial concept selling,
<p>loses his superiority in the growth stage to other players. (Philips pioneered audio cassettes,
did the concept selling in competition with records, LPs, EPs and eight tracks. They gave their
technology to Sony who did better than Philips during the growth stage.)
<p>Growth stage means increase in demand and the manufacturers have to meet the demand. Their
strategic options depend on the position they enjoy in the market as can be seen next:
<p>Let us take the fi rm&rsquo;s position to be that of the market leader or that of market follower.
<p>Position as market leader
Options:
<p> Fight &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; maintain &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; or enhance
Flight &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; exit &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; or fortify</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management234
<p>For maintaining the market share, the fi rm should increase its business as per the market growth
and invest in advertising and selling on that basis. For enhancing the market share, the fi rm should
increase its market share at a faster or bigger pace than the rate of market growth.
<p>In real life, if the fi rm plans only to maintain its position, it may end up losing its market share
and if it plans to enhance it, it may just be able to maintain its market share as competitors are also
in the fray with their plans.
<p>The next option for some fi rms could be that of fl ight, that is, giving up their leadership pos-
ition. They can either exit or fortify, that is, get in to some niche market. At times the expenditure in
maintaining the leadership position is high and it eats away all the profi ts. Firms do plan to leave
their leadership position in such circumstances.
<p>Hewlett-Packard (HP) calculators gave up their leadership to Texas Instruments and went into
the niche market. HP had started into a narrow market with low level of advertising efforts and they
could raise the prices after leaving the market leadership.
<p>Let us examine the options followers have in the market. They can either take up the leadership
position or remain followers. For each the choices can be:
<p> Position themselves as follower in the market.
Assume leadership by copying the leader or by leapfrogging by using latest techniques.
<p>In case of copying the leader, the follower can do one better by learning from the mistakes committed
by the leader. The follower thus challenges the leader. The follower also tracks the mistakes of the
leader and turns them into opportunities. If the leader is not making a mistake then the follower has
to overtake the leader by using new technology, new plans and policies so that he can leapfrog into
the leadership position.
<p>A good example of leapfrogging is the leadership position now being enjoyed by the Japanese fi rms
in the area of cars, which was the virtual monopoly of Americans. In the area of consumer electronics
also, Japanese fi rms have leapfrogged to leadership position. The Japanese have taken recourse to
improvements in process technology and not just planned better products. Re-engineering in produc-
tion technology and innovative distribution has helped them to leapfrog to leadership positions. Hence,
Japanese fi rms have gone for high volumes and economies of scale of manufacture. The customers do
not see the new processes; they see only better and economically-priced products.
<p>The next option for the follower is to settle for being number two. There is only one number one
possible and the second place helps in remaining focused (a fi rm advertises that we try harder to
please the customer because we are number two). They can cater to the customers who are not with
the leader. The leader could be in the mass market, spending large sums of money in advertising and
promotion to stay number one. The fi rm in the second position could get into a niche market. Or, the
follower could target all customers except those with the leader, that is, the customers of the fi rms in
third, fourth and fi fth position, and so on. If the follower wants the third position then he can target
the customers from the followers numbering four, fi ve, and so on.
<p>STRATEGIES FOR THE LATE GROWTH STAGE
IN THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
<p>Late growth stage in the PLC is when segmentation is a useful strategy to satisfy knowledge-
able customers. Strategically, the fi rms need to either defend their position or fi nd out unexplored
niche markets.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 235
<p>The salient features of the late growth stage are:
<p>1. Sales volumes grow slowly.
2. There are many competitors.
3. Price competition starts.
4. Excess capacity is likely to occur.
5. Channel members play one against the other to gain extra advantage.
6. Customers are very intelligent and demand a lot as specifi c benefi ts.
7. Marketing efforts focus on specifi ed segments.
<p>The computer industry has suffered the world over as the growth in the last 10 years reduced from
a healthy 50 per cent to only 25 per cent. This has resulted in excess capacity and sellers are resorting
to promotional plans. They bundle a lot of software with the hardware as sales promotion. With lower
demand and reduced production, the fi xed costs per unit go up.
<p>In the late growth stage, the customer&rsquo;s demands are more specifi c and market segmentation
becomes critical. The strategies, which leaders and followers can pursue, are:
<p>1. Leaders: Target many segments.
2. Followers: Target a few segments only.
<p>Each segment needs a different type of at least one of the 4Ps.
With excess production capacity and price pressures, fi rms could decide to exit from the business
<p>altogether. A fi rm might need money for some other business and it might plan to exit this business.
Sometimes the follower might leapfrog to the leadership position and the leader may decide to exit
from the business.
<p>Summarising, it can be concluded that:
<p>1. Early and late growth stages of the PLC have different increases in sales volumes which require
different strategic initiatives.
<p>2. Leaders and followers have separate strategic requirements in all stages of the PLC.

<p>STRATEGIES FOR THE MATURITY STAGE OF THE
PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
<p>When the products reach the maturity stage, their demand growth stops&mdash;it reaches a plateau. Firms
need to manage the sales in this stage either for cash or they should plan product differentiation or </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management236
<p>geographic extension of the markets in the country or through exports. However, if opportunity costs
exceed present value benefi ts, it is better to exit from the product sales.
<p>Mature markets are known for sophisticated buyers, well-organised segments, reduced differences
in products offered by competitors and stable sales volumes.
<p>The maturity stage has the following main characteristics:
<p>1. Constant sales volumes year to year.
2. Product differentiation vanishes as the competition also makes &lsquo;me too&rsquo; products.
<p>It is, however, not necessary that in a product range all the models may be in the same stage of
the PLC. For example, in cars, one model may have reached maturity and another may be in the
introductory stage.
<p>Sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) can be achieved by differentiating one or more of the
following in the maturity stage:
<p>1. Service.
2. Distribution.
3. Advertising of intangible benefi ts like brand equity and service.
4. Product differentiation does not make much of an impact in the maturity stage.
5. Pricing takes a toll and it has to be competitive. In India, with new car models coming to the
<p>market, Maruti had to reduce its price.
6. Buyers are knowledgeable. They know about fi rms and competitive products. They are
<p>discerning and have bargaining power.
7. There are relatively few new buyers. Firms, when they want to increase sales, either take
<p>customers from the competition or they fi ght for the small number of new buyers. In most
cases, some old buyers quit the fi eld and new ones replace them.
<p>Let it be understood that for most products, except for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG),
taking customers from the competition is a diffi cult task as any action, like price reduction can lead
to a price war. The lower price can, in any case, be met by the competition, and so, status quo will
remain as far as market shares are concerned.
<p>In maturity stage, leaders and followers have different strategic options available to them. Leaders
may mature products as cash cows or they may harvest for profi ts. Followers may try to keep the mar-
ket share at the existing level, grow or even exit as per the following plan:
<p>1. Leaders: Manage for cash or harvest, that is, reduce market share by going for a niche
market.
<p>2. Followers: Maintain the market share, grow or exit.
<p>Maintaining or increasing market share needs investments, and therefore, reduces profi ts. Market
share ceases to be of any importance in the maturity stage. Followers can take the leadership position,
if the leaders quit the business or assume the position of a follower. However, the followers must fi nd
out the reasons why the leader is leaving the top spot. For example, they must fi nd out if the leader is
quitting because there is a new technology available now. Market segmentation is the key to success
in this stage. It is necessary to offer specifi c benefi ts to a group of customers or to the segment. It is of
importance if the switching costs of customers for changing products are low.</p>

<p>Tasks for Students
1. What are the strategic implications in the maturity stage with highly sophisticated buyers?
2. How can fi rms keep gross margins high in the maturity stage?
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>Let us see, how fi rms can keep prices high in the maturity stage. They can have distinct product
differentiation to keep the switching costs high. They can build their brand equity high and have
superior service. These intangible benefi ts will place the product in the customers mindset; keep
competition away and the fi rm can still manage high profi t margins.
<p>Summarising, mature markets are stable with few major players and reduced product differences
among competitors. These markets also provide cash for invigorating newer product concepts.
<p>The Ford car company was down in the dumps in 1980. Then the new president, Don Peterson,
told his management team to get the best features of the cars worldwide, without omitting any
feature, including door handles and glove compartments size. Ford was back on its feet in less time
than was envisaged.
<p>MARKET STRATEGIES IN THE DECLINE STAGE OF THE
PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE
<p>The decline stage in the PLC is characterised by decrease in sales volume as a result of product demand,
demographic changes and technological changes over a period of time. Cheaper substitute products
and changes in customers&rsquo; tastes also account for the decline stage.
<p>Key factors that are present in the decline stage are:
<p>1. Over-capacity in production.
2. Severe price competition.
3. Several competitors exit.
<p>For covering, at least, the fi xed cost, sales are made with low profi t margins, as it is not easy to
reduce production. However, if fi xed costs are low, then the fi rm can plan to downsize the production.
If variable costs are high, exiting is easy. However, on high variable cost it is diffi cult to exit the busi-
ness. Success in the maturity stage through fi xed costs help fi rms survive in the decline stage as well.
With high fi xed costs it is easy to get into penetrating prices.
<p>The marketing strategies for the decline stage are given in Table 10.7:
<p>Table 10.7 Marketing Strategies for Decline Stage of PLC
<p>Hospitable market Inhospitable market
<p>Leaders Maintain lead Harvest
Followers Harvest Divest
<p>A hospitable market in the decline stage is one where the rate of decline is slow, otherwise it becomes
inhospitable. Leaders in a hospitable market can keep their market going down at the rate the market </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management238
<p>is declining. For harvesting, fi rms bring down their market share and try to get into a niche market. In
an inhospitable market, the follower&rsquo;s best strategy is to exit from the market. At this stage, marketing
mix wars begin starting with price wars. It should, however, be understood that the players are all
fi ghting over a shrinking pie. Penetrating prices, higher investments in advertising and promotion
mark the decline stage. It becomes a vicious cycle, like the arms race of the twentieth century between
the US and the erstwhile USSR and hence should be avoided by fi rms. Several fi rms decide to get out
of the market. However, the fi rm which decides to stay on, gets into a monopoly situation and can
reap the skimming price benefi ts till the market remains.
<p>One fi rm in India was in the business of making radio valves and as most radio manufacturers
changed to using semiconductor devices, other valve manufacturers in the world stopped making
them resulting in monopoly for this fi rm. As there was a market in Africa, there the fi rm could charge
better prices than those in the Indian market. It followed a strategy of skimmed price for a few years
before the demand dwindled to zero.
<p>In case of some products being reintroduced in the market, the last survivor gets the benefi t.
In Summary, a life cycle audit helps the fi rms in determining where their products are placed in
<p>the life cycle so that their marketing can be strategically planned.
Hence, fi rms need to do a life cycle audit as shown in Table 10.8:
<p>Table 10.8 Product Life Cycle Audit

followers Introductory stage Growth stage Maturity stage Decline stage

<p>The audit summarises the entire PLC. It is possible to plan strategies for the entire PLC with built-in
contingency.
<p>PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ANALYSIS
<p>Portfolio analysis takes into account the fact that large multi-product fi rms have synergies within and
they need to provide resources for growing their attractive businesses, divesting poor performers with
unattractive profi ts/or losses. They need to divert resources from mature and stable businesses to
attractive promising businesses.
<p>Portfolio analysis empowers managers to balance future and current opportunities by assessing
business attractiveness and competitive position in a two-dimensional matrix.
<p>Firms have a life of their own, as a single-product fi rm will die if that product fails. Managers
want multi-product fi rms to ensure that some product would always be in the growth stage. Portfolio
analysis is managed as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 239
<p>1. Focus on two major dimensions of marketing strategy.
2. Look for business attractiveness to assess how good the business opportunity is and the relative
<p>competitive position to understand if the fi rm can be a winner.
3. Understanding of different resource needs. Some businesses need resources and others have
<p>excess resources.
<p>Resources of a company include its fi nances, human resources, technology, information and man-
agerial resources. So far the discussion has been on getting competitive advantage for individual
products. However, in case of a multi-product fi rm, emphasis should be on managing the products
together and not separately. For making an analysis of a fi rm&rsquo;s strength, the Boston Consultancy
Group (BCG), has developed a matrix as shown in Figure 10.2.
<p>Figure 10.2 Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) Matrix
<p>In Figure 10.2, the horizontal axis shows the market share of the product and the vertical axis shows
the market growth. Let us see the position of products in the different quadrants:
<p>1. Quadrant star: In this quadrant, the market growth of the product is high and the fi rm&rsquo;s prod-
uct enjoys high market share. It is characterised by the following:
<p> The fi rm&rsquo;s product enjoys a strong market position, that of the leader.
The market growth of the product is high and attractive.
Competitor&rsquo;s better technology and superior market acceptance can make the fi rm&rsquo;s business
<p>risky, even if it enjoys leadership position.
It has low profi ts, as the leader has to spend large amounts on marketing and advertising to
<p>maintain its leadership.
High expenditure is required for the marketing mix factors.
<p> Strategic options in the star quadrant are:
<p> Increase share: Invest in anticipation of higher market growth, put entry barriers for
newcomers through pricing, innovative distribution and advertising.
<p> Maintain share: Have good market intelligence to be able to counter their actions. Invest in
marketing mix selectively.
<p>2. Quadrant question mark: In this quadrant, the market share is low although the growth of
the market is high. The position of the product is as follows:
<p> The product is in the growth stage while the fi rm&rsquo;s product has a low market share.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management240
<p> The fi rm has the opportunity to increase its market share by investing in advertising and
promotion.
<p> It is often a new entrant. It could be that all players are new or one could have assumed
leadership in the market.
<p> Risks are high, technology and basic product acceptance in the market is not fully established.
There are negative profi ts and huge expenses in marketing for either concept selling or for
<p>increasing market share.
Long-term and strong commitment of the management is required for the product&rsquo;s growth
<p>to attain star position.
The fi rm must decide on how many of its products are in this quadrant and how many of
<p>them can it support on a long-term basis.
The fi rm could get into some niche market segment.
If the fi rm has several products in this quadrant, and it keeps them all in its product portfolio,
<p>it is in a strategic trap, because it cannot place proper resources for them and is in danger of
losing all.
<p>3. Quadrant cash cow: A fi rm is in this quadrant when it has a high market share but the market
growth is low. The fi rm can reduce its marketing expenses as it is already in a dominant
marketing position and can become low-cost supplier. The main features of a fi rm in this
quadrant are:
<p> Dominant market position.
Slow market growth.
Low-cost supplier.
Good profi t and cash generation.
Low market risk.
<p> Strategies for fi rms in the cash cow quadrant are:
<p> Manage for cash, maintain market share.
Cautious investment in market as growth is low.
Cash generation can be used for products in the question mark quadrant.
Harvest and go for the niche market if future prospects are low.
Divest if product demand is going down at a rapid pace because new technology products
<p>have come into the market or because customers&rsquo; tastes are changing.
<p>4. Quadrant dog: In this quadrant, market growth is weak and the fi rm has a low market share.
The market situation can be described as follows:
<p> Weak market position.
Slow market growth.
High-cost supplier.
Poor or no profi t and cash generation. However, by managing it carefully and by using the
<p>niche market route it can be profi table too.
The product could be affected by the management&rsquo;s ego as it once was a star product.
High management turnover as the product is not doing well. Many times it is said that
<p>&lsquo;customers know us because of this product.&rsquo;
The management spends a lot of time in planning strategies for this product with hardly
<p>any gain.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 241
<p> Strategies for products in the dog quadrant are:
<p> Maintain market share for whatever cash the product generates.
Plan for changing or adding some market segments.
Stop all new investments in the product.
Divest&mdash;sell the product and use the funds for other products in the question mark quadrant.
Keep the product for any goodwill it may have or if there are strong exit barriers.
Turn around by innovating, bring about product differentiation or downsizing.
Get into a niche market.
<p>The investment cycle for the BCG Matrix, therefore, is as given in Figure 10.3:
<p>Figure 10.3 Investment Cycle in BCG Matrix
<p>The extra cash generated in the cash cow stage is invested in the question mark stage to bring the
product into the star stage. Over time the market growth of a star product goes down when it reaches
the maturity stage of its life cycle and it starts having extra cash, which is invested in the question
mark stage to complete the cycle.
<p>THE GE MODEL
<p>The BCG Matrix has been fi ne-tuned by the GE Model, which can be used to defi ne markets and
product positions as given in Figure 10.4:
<p>Figure 10.4 GE Matrix</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management242
<p>In the GE Matrix, market attractiveness and a fi rm&rsquo;s market share for a product can be plotted as
high, medium and low, thus enabling the fi rm to understand the position more accurately and plan
its strategies accordingly.
<p>Market attractiveness can be measured by studying:
<p>1. Market size and growth.
2. Degree of market concentration&mdash;is it localised or is it spread out.
3. Industry profi tability.
4. Price sensitivity of demand.
5. Exit and entry barriers.
6. Strength of channel members.
7. Rate of obsolescence or technology change.
<p>A fi rm&rsquo;s market share and its competitive position can be seen from the following:
<p>1. Market share
2. Profi t margins
3. Brand loyalty
4. Degree of product differentiation
5. Proprietary technology
6. Financial position
7. Personnel
<p>Summarising, market share and market potential are mapped in a portfolio analysis to provide a
visual understanding of the industry players and the attractiveness and competitive positions of the
fi rm&rsquo;s products. Portfolio analysis can be used to fi nd out where resources should be deployed and
to determine the relationship among a fi rm&rsquo;s products and competitors.
<p>Task for Students
1. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of portfolio analysis.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>The study of strategic marketing should make the student aware of the necessity of the study as
in today&rsquo;s market, the business environment keeps changing rapidly, and unless fast decisions are
taken, fi rms are going to be left behind in the competition. It helps a fi rm to make long-range plans, to
remain proactive and avoid fi re-fi ghting measures, which is what is taking place in most fi rms today.
It also helps in taking short-term action to beat the competition in unstable conditions.
<p>Firms are able to make the right investment decisions, as also plan resource allocations in the areas
that bring the desired results and avoid supporting loss-making investments. Communication through
the organisation to the suppliers and buyers can be directed to help the fi rm in achieving its objectives.
Most importantly, it helps fi rms in dealing with changes taking place in the business environment
most effectively and to its full advantage.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 243
<p>Time is the essence of success in business. What needs to be done, must be done with a sense of
urgency, and therefore, it is imperative for a fi rm to keep scanning both the general and the competi-
tive environments continuously and take proactive decisions for continued success. Otherwise,
fi rms will remain in the fi re-fi ghting mode all the time in trying to cope with immediate and current
problems and will not be able to take advantage of the opportunities the business environment keeps
generating all the time.
<p>INTERNATIONAL MARKETING STRATEGIES
<p>Marketing strategy formulation has remained in the realm of the marketing director and is supposed
to be based on scientifi c planning process. However, while line managers are asked to take the onus
of strategic failures, no one has yet come up with a foolproof method of market strategy planning.
To ensure the success of the planning process the marketing team should be fully aware of the roles
of plans, planners and evaluators of the outcomes of the plans. The strategic plans should invariably
consider the means of achieving the corporate objectives through actions taken by the team based on
the declared vision of the company.
<p>Both executing managers of the plans and the planners need to be clear of their roles in the planning
and plan execution process. Planners normally are knowledgeable on the planning tools, have time
on their hands and are ready to analyse the existing situation. On the other hand, managers have the
authority to take action, make commitments, delegate their authority as they can access huge amounts
of information available to the line managers. Managers tend to act in the following manner:
<p>1. Action over decision after a lot of contemplation.
2. Avoid analytical processes and inputs.
3. Use their gut feeling rather than market research feedbacks.
4. Verbal orders, informal approach rather than programmed orchestration of action.
<p>Planning International Marketing
<p>There is a need for focus on the company&rsquo;s objectives and direction to guide the team in achieving the
same. Strategic marketing, therefore, needs to be reoriented and revitalised as the companies adjust
to external environments in order to even survive. Success of companies comes from their response
to market changes, need to make companies lean, minus the pyramid of hierarchy. Flatter companies
have less red tape and creation of marketing strategies becomes easy and streamlined.
<p>The days of top-level strategy planning by the company&rsquo;s CEO have reached a deadend, as CEOs
retire leaving a void for the followers, who remain undecided on the fate of the strategy. Earlier, after the
strategy had been prepared by the marketing head, the team would work out the operational planning.
It must be recognised that the success of the plan depends on a sense of ownership, amongst the people
who would actually carry out the plan. While opinions are asked for, the boss dictates the strategy
while the followers carry it out. With severe competition and volatile international markets, the time
frame of response to changing customer needs has drastically shortened. As market insights are mostly
available with the salespersons and others dealing with outside clients, companies need to develop a </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management244
<p>mechanism that gets the information collected by the front liners straight to the strategists. Only then
will quick response to market needs become possible. Strategic marketing plan documents can be
communicated to employees at different levels and their opinions sought, which can get incorporated
in the fi nal document. A better educated, knowledgeable workforce has, to an extent, helped in
bringing about the change. While companies cannot doubt their machines and quality standards, it
is simply a matter of providing a product to the market with lower costs and better features. This can
be achieved by bringing the widest diversity of ideas to the teams to stimulate lateral breakthrough
thinking. Using technological ideas alone would be meaningless in this age of rapid market changes.
Senior marketing managers can bring in cross-functional teams to achieve broad mandate to meet
the marketing challenges. Companies can, besides their internal resources, use inputs from external
suppliers and the customers. The success formula can thus be described as:
<p>1. Focusing on customers and markets.
2. Staying fl exible and responsive.
3. Keeping valuable marketers at all levels.
4. Optimising management time usage.
<p>Companies need to realise that the total quality management (TQM) type worker empowerment
can become a critical force rather than just a nice concept to provide a fi rm a sustainable competitive
advantage. It can be safely said that while formulating marketing strategies used to be an exclusive
province of senior managers, today it has become everyone&rsquo;s effort.
<p>Since the 1970s, marketing strategy planning has been in vogue, even while it was considered
fl awed. Certain changes have taken place over the past 20 years, as discussed next:
<p>1. Planning responsibility has been shifted from staff to line managers.
2. Planning process has been decentralised to strategic business units while the key issues remain
<p>with the corporate-level planners.
3. Greater attention is being paid to changing market business and the competitive environment
<p>besides changes in the technological environment.
<p>The planning process itself has undergone changes with less reliability on the growth share matrix,
or experience curve and greater acceptance of organic techniques like scenario planning, TQM and
sensitivity towards many variables like salesperson&rsquo;s training and advertising effi cacy. Organisational
culture holds the key to success of the planning process along with the organisational hierarchy.
Marketing strategies represent the value base management along with motivation and behaviour of
marketing team that determine the corporate success or otherwise in implementing the strategies.
<p>Summarising, the challenges to the successful implementation of marketing strategies depend on
the following areas:
<p>1. External forces:
<p> Market shifts
Economic forces and restructuring
Competition
Political changes and government policies
Technological changes
Environmental factors
Social factors</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 245
<p>2. Internal forces:
<p> Corporate culture
Management commitment and managerial skills
Financial challenges
Innovation
Operational plans
Marketing strategies
<p>Planners need to perform the role of strategic programming, of communicating the plan to both
internal and selected external customers. Planners need to organise control points built in the process
for possibilities of timely intervention, if required. Planners need to be analysts in order to be able to
make effective strategic plans. Finally, strategic planners need to be catalysts of change in the company.

<p>The best way to look at the international business today is to look from the viewpoint of buyers.
Hence, the selling process of the earlier times has given way to the buying process. In some cases, the
buyers are easily identifi able while in others the fi rms have to locate the buyers and the exchange of
roles in the buying family has to be understood, before the sellers can start understanding the buying
process. In small purchases like FMCGs, the user is usually the buyer and decider of the brand to be
purchased. For consumer durables, where larger sums of money are involved, there is a team&mdash;offi cial
or unoffi cial&mdash;which takes the purchase decisions, as follows:
<p> The person in need of the product.
The guide who infl uences the decisions.
The authority who approves of the purchase.
The actual buyer who goes to the market and buys the product.
The users of the product.
<p>For example, the teenage son may feel the need of a new colour TV Set, before the football world
cup. He would ask his electronics engineer uncle about the different brands and which of them gives
the best value for money. The head of the family, father in most cases, would approve of the purchase
and then the teenager with the uncle may go to actually buy the TV. All the family members would
watch the TV albeit at different timings.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management246
<p>Once the buyer has decided about the product he wants to buy, he would arrange a series of dis-
cussions with his friends, relatives and experts in the fi eld, and form his own opinion about the
available brands of the product. If he has used the product earlier, he would have built attitudes and
preferences on various brands available in the market. The differentiated products can cause peculiar
buying behaviour when the product is costly, diffi cult to maintain and complex in nature. At times,
price and ease of purchase can be the deciding factors. Servicing Networks can become the products
USP, as is the case of Maruti cars today in India. When the level of differentiation is low, price, service
and guarantee play a role in purchase decisions.
<p>In case of products not much differentiated, the buyer decides on price and ease of buying, location
of the shop and of the service centre. Once the product is purchased, the buyer/user forms another
opinion about the product, which may be consistent with pre-purchase opinion or it may be entirely
different, if the experience of product-use has been negative. Market communication must there-
fore be uniform in telling the customer about the true benefi ts he will accrue by the use of the product,
and this must be reinforced continuously when the customer is using the product, so that the opinion
remains favourable only.
<p>A degree of diffi culty in buying comes from buyer&rsquo;s lack of knowledge about the product. For high
technology products like cars, computers and air conditioners, buyers do well to seek professional
assistance to fi nd out which type of product would satisfy their needs. The expert advice is given in
the advertisements about the product, in the product literature and from the salespersons of the fi rm.
Once a need is felt or a problem comes up, the person looks for a product, which will be adequate for
his purpose and within his budget. The selection between brands is made by analysing the attributes
of different brands, their prices and benefi ts they would provide to the buyer. The seller would do well
to know the information gathering process of the buyers, the language they understand and the ideal
channel of communication in order to reach the majority of buyers in the target market segment.
<p>In products where the difference between brands does not exist, and are expensive, the buyer would
opt for the one giving best service, having ease of buying like nearness of the shop and the product
price. For FMCG products, which are low in cost, the buyers tend to stick to a favourite brand. Hence,
to make their brand popular in a competitive situation, fi rms need to promote them through special
offers. The market leading fi rms wanting to continue to dominate the market, use the push strategy of
high inventory, merchandising and reminder advertising. The follower fi rms need to use pull strategy
of heavy advertising, lower pricing and frequent promotional activities.
<p>Buyers seeking information about the product use the following tracks:
<p> Retail shops, dealers of the product.
Friends, relatives, colleagues.
Product testing like car test drives.
Advertisements.
<p>In order to reach the buyer, the fi rms can modify the product like offering bigger storage capacity
in PCs, brain washing through focused advertising, redefi ning the main attributes of the product and
laying emphasis on the variety of attributes the product possesses and more importantly the benefi ts
the customer will obtain from using the product.
<p>Purchase decisions are taken in the sequence shown in Figure 10.6.
Opinion of an advisor becomes important depending on the advisor, his relationship with the
<p>buyer, his knowledge and expertise on the product. Location of the shop, service facilities are other
factors considered while taking the purchase decision. Decisions are also taken on the imminence of </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Strategic Marketing 247
<p>the need, like the decision to purchase an air conditioner just before the beginning of summer in the
northern part of India. The decisions to be taken are as follows:
<p> Which brand to buy.
Which dealer to buy from.
Whether to pay full amount or buy on hire purchase.
How many to buy.
When to buy the product.
<p>People delay purchases, as they do not want to part with the money unless it is essential to do so.
The buyers view product quality, its relevance to the need, its utility value and its value as a second
hand product as decision pointers.
<p>Buyers are also aware that after sometime, they will not be using the product and will have to get
rid of it. In the West, repair of defective goods is expensive; people tend to dump the old products and
buy new ones. In India repair is still possible and therefore people tend to keep their products with
them much longer. A new promotional plan has emerged in India&mdash;that of exchange offers&mdash;in which
the buyer can give his used product to the seller, who will offer a price for it and deduct that amount
from the price of the new purchased product. In many countries the owners of old cars have to pay
the transporters to carry their cars to the junkyard.
<p>International Marketing Game 10.1
<p>The teams should hold discussions with some personnel of the company under review to fi nd
out the qualitative strengths of their workers and their learning standards. Organisations must be in
the learning stage if they want to maintain and increase their market share and brand equity. Hence,
organisational analysis is the most important area that needs to be analysed with care. Viewing
the behaviour pattern of an organisation&rsquo;s people can help assess the organisational culture; do

<p>they look up and about, and moving with a purpose, or do they have a laid-back attitude towards
the fi rm and its results. Are all the members of the fi rm committed to the vision, mission, goals
and objectives of the fi rm? These soft areas of a fi rm provide a candid refl ection of the direction
the fi rm is going to take.
The better-managed fi rms permeate a positive sense of urgency in their managers. They keep
comparing their own results with the results of their competitors. They keep raising the bar of
excellence to push themselves to better performance, even if they are the best in the business.
Innovation and creativity form the bedrock of their enthusiastic working energy, which separates
winners from non-winners.

<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
Companies have been operating in the domestic markets with one real goal in front of them, that
of continuously improving their bottom lines and bring in profi table results. Today, however, only those
companies will survive in the domestic as well as the international markets that take care of their
stakeholders. In the process they create a double bottom line, which includes, taking care of, besides
the shareholders, all the other stakeholders of the company as well. This chapter gives a detailed
account of corporate survival and initiates the students in the intricacies of double bottom line paramount
for today&rsquo;s business success in the international market that covers the interests of the stakeholders
besides that of the shareholders that envisages only the profi t bottom lines.</p>

<p>Firms or businesses are a refl ection of the society in which they operate. Firms have to respond to
the demands of society. The fashion trends, luxury items, daily need products and the famous
4Ps&mdash;product, price, promotion and placement&mdash;have to be totally geared to a society to be suc-
<p>cessful. Similarly, society can be a refl ection of how a fi rm operates. The much-maligned public sector
fi rms and a few Good Samaritan private fi rms have been in the forefront in this area. These fi rms have
started schools and hospitals, adopted parks and sometimes even villages. They provide these vil-
lages education and healthcare. Firms are giving away some of their profi ts and in the process gaining
brand equity. As a next step, fi rms are putting-in pollution control devices in their manufacturing
plants to remove pollutants from their factory discharges. Firms are creating social and environmental
value, besides economic value for their stakeholders. It can be safely predicted that in the future only
stakeholder-inclusive fi rms will survive and prosper.
<p>Peter Drucker has aptly said, &lsquo;the talk you hear about adopting to change is not only stupid, it is
dangerous. The only way you can manage change is to create it.&rsquo;
<p>The main point, therefore, is that in the twenty-fi rst century it is the stakeholder-inclusive fi rm,
which would attain success, as against the stakeholder-exclusive fi rms. Therefore, business can now be
defi ned as follows: Business is not about right and wrong, good or bad; it is a guideline for best practices
and techniques for stakeholder inclusion, which aims to deliver optimal business performance.
<p>Firms must keep the interest of stakeholders in mind along with commercial value and social
causes. The success or failure of fi rms will depend on the fact whether they are stakeholder-inclusive or
stakeholder-exclusive in their operations. The following are the stakeholders of a fi rm (Table 11.1):

<p>THE WORLD BUSINESS SCENE
<p>Firms with limited liability provide opportunity to the management to take risks, which are part of
entrepreneurship. However, it also creates, at times, a monster, which indulges in frauds and abuse
of the power, as any student of commerce and economics in India and the world would vouch for.
(So many scams, fi nancial frauds have surfaced in the last one year, which makes one wonder about
the cases going undetected.) Stakeholder-inclusive corporations create accountability and hence
ensure that these scams and frauds do not occur at all.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Stakeholders 251
<p>The second point in favour of stakeholder-inclusive fi rms is that while we believe in free trade
and competition, we do everything in our power to become the market leader, through mergers,
acquisitions and monopoly.
<p>Large fi rms infl uence world economics, create wealth and do good; but they also have the power
of abusing their economic strengths.
<p>Hence, the long-term value of a fi rm depends primarily on the knowledge, ability and commitment
of its employees and managers, and its relationship with its customers and other stakeholders. Firms
run in the interest of the wide range of its stakeholders are more likely to behave responsibly. A fi rm&rsquo;s
operations need to be transparent and if fi rms start becoming transparent, the scam graph might go
down. Firms must understand that they can successfully create both commercial and social values as
they are mutually reinforcing and lead to greater stakeholder loyalty and corporate resilience. Add-
itionally, social and commercial transparencies provide an identity to the fi rm as well as improve
its effi ciency.
<p>It is to be noted that only economic value is shared with the stakeholders, while social and en-
vironmental concerns remain under the wraps. However, it needs to be kept in mind that a fi rm&rsquo;s
involvement in environmental and social issues brings it the public&rsquo;s goodwill. Thus it can be
summarised that stakeholder-inclusive fi rms will always outperform stakeholder-exclusive fi rms.
To make an analogy between a fi rm and the human body, it is known that the human body functions
well only if all its organs work well. Firms neglecting any of the stakeholders would be doing so at
their own risk and peril.
<p>At the present time, most fi rms are focusing on the benefi t to their shareholders, who in a way are
the owners of the fi rm. Surprisingly, such fi rms are self-centred and they create imbalances that affect
people and the planet, imbalances that are dysfunctional and unsustainable in nature. The theory that
manufacturing done by the cheapest labour anywhere in the world will add to a fi rm&rsquo;s wealth appears
short-lived as low wages do not create markets and the products remain unsold as the wealthier
markets have reached saturation point. Global imbalances are creating global crises.
<p>Stakeholder-inclusive fi rms start to restore the balance by considering a variety of stakeholders
in addition to their shareholders.
<p>Looking at the free enterprises of the free markets, how free are the free markets? If we look at the
US, they have imposed a quota system for imports from other countries, while due to their monetary
strength they can sell their products anywhere they see a market. They make the rules of the game
and expect everyone else to play by their rules. The line judges of the business game are from the
affl uent countries and the fairness of the judges is in the least doubtful. Is the capitalistic business
controllable? If yes, who can really control it?
<p>The current shareholder-fi rst free market system is not delivering a just and sustainable future for
the present generation and it will certainly fail the next, as some players keep winning at the expense
of others. This has brought about a universal crisis of confi dence in business as an institution.
<p>Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations written in the seventeenth century stated: &lsquo;Rules of free
enterprise are not applied in their pure form in any market economy on earth. The rules of free
enterprise completely understate the human and social dimensions.&rsquo; It is as true today as it was in
the seventeenth century.
<p>Coming to market globalisation, it will result in further regression of the industrial, commercial
and social aspects of the world polity. There are chances that unless care is taken, the global economy
could kill social and cultural norms, local economies, ethics and religions. To avoid this catastrophe,
national laws must prevail along with economic globalisation.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management252
<p>Business espousing free trade has a tendency of aiming for market dominance and monopoly
through mergers. Mergers usually cut down on a fi rm&rsquo;s personnel and bring about unemployment.
The unfortunate part today is that no one is powerful enough to put a stop to it, not even the World
Trade Organization. There is no provision for trade protection for products from less affl uent
nations. The free market has become the hunting ground of the rich nations and it is in a mess as far
as the other nations are concerned.
<p>Firms worldwide should think what they can do for improving the life on the planet. Rich cor-
porations worldwide should emulate SmithKline and Beecham who gave a US$ 1 billion for the
eradication of diseases in the world. This is a kind of paying back of what the fi rm has earned from
the markets. Such sustainable community developments would establish strong relationship between
a fi rm and its stakeholders.
<p>PROFITS&mdash;THE BOTTOM LINE
<p>Firms in the free market economy are concerned only about the profi ts they are making, take home
and the bottom line. They little realise that once a fi rm starts taking care of its stakeholders, profi ts
become the by-products of the fi rm&rsquo;s operations and accrue automatically. They should, however,
go for the double bottom line, that is, besides economic value creation, they should add social and
environmental value to the bottom line.
<p>The time has come when managers will be accountable not just for the economic bottom line but
also for value creation on the social and environmental levels as well; those not performing could be
asked to move out of the fi rm. On the other hand, those managers successful in creating economic,
social and environmental value would be adding to the competitive advantage of the fi rm.
<p>CORPORATE STYLES
<p>Firms need to be managed; however, the need today is of more than just management. Corporate
governance must include the stakeholders. This cycle of inclusion makes the fi rm move forward.
Governance covers social and environment audit besides fi nancial audit. It works well when the
fi rm puts people and their needs ahead of its own. Sustainable governance comes from looking
after the totality of stakeholder stakes in the fi rm. Unfortunately, fi rms, leaders, investors, bankers,
chief executive offi cers (CEOs) and employees strive for self-centred success at the expense of the
environment. Polluted rivers with dying fi sh, polluted air in the metros, bad infrastructure, treeless
hills, periodic fl oods and droughts are symptoms of a sick nation; a nation made sick by the lust of the
business leaders for money. Chimneys spouting soot-fi lled smoke, cars throwing out polluting smoke
are evidence enough of that lust. This makes capitalism an individual pursuit. Since the surround-
ings are our own creation, they are naturally meant to assist us in obtaining what we desire. If we
want to receive the maximum at all times, we must have an attitude of giving. If you want to receive,
you must give; this is the law of nature.
<p>Increasing the stakeholder value is the overriding moral obligation of a fi rm. Adam Smith&rsquo;s
&lsquo;invisible hand&rsquo; has failed to materialise, and instead, radical wealth imbalance has been created. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p>International Stakeholders 253
<p>Businessmen are not bad people; they have to operate within an economic framework, which in-
creasingly rewards short-term autocratic behaviour. As managers succeed in the system, they further
improve the same for following the economic framework.
<p>EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS
<p>Employees and customers must be heard. A business&rsquo;s long-term growth and sustainability depends
on incorporating their voices in the management decision-making process and in strategic planning.
Conventional business has for a long time considered employees as non-living beings, who come
with their hands and feet leaving their brains at home, so that they can perform mundane tasks as
told by their boss.
<p>Customers have been classifi ed, segmented and cast into different moulds, while in reality they
are all individual living entities with separate personalities, behaviours and desires. The leaders of
business should realise that if they do not listen, they do not know! Sustainable development will
not come from technical solutions, eco-effi ciency, risk management, helpful though these may be
in reducing pollution and waste in the short term. Business leaders have to go deep into the malice
facing the country and the planet to enable them to leave the world a better place for the coming
generations, better than what they got. You reap what you sow, or rather your children will reap what
you sow today.
<p>Different fi rms, investors, bankers, business leaders, CEOs, employees and customers, separately
compete for the same resources, in a win&ndash;lose scenario; ultimately it becomes a lose&ndash;lose scenario
in terms of sustainability. Suffering and struggle is not inevitable. Stakeholder-managed fi rms
divide the resources more evenly amongst the competing groups to create a win&ndash;win situation.
Therefore, the stakeholders must participate in the management of the fi rm and their interests must
be aligned at the corporate and individual level in order to best deliver what the customers and other
stakeholders need. Coherent functioning of all components of a system leads to synergic strengths
of that system. Corporate invincibility emerges when all the stakeholders are in a synchronous and
synergetic mode.
<p>VALUE-BASED MANAGEMENT
<p>There is a trend today in the management of fi rms towards accountability and stakeholders interests;
enhanced role for strategic planning; ethical standards and professionalism. Besides, familiarity with
international markets is a prerequisite for a globalised economy. Professionalism can be defi ned as
individuals working in the fi rm keeping the fi rm&rsquo;s interest on top and their own subservient to the
fi rm&rsquo;s interests. The best situation is when the individual interest is directly in line with the interests
of the fi rm. With scams, that is, employees cheating customers as well as, at times, cheating fi rms,
professionalism has reached a low point, and if individuals want to progress in the fi rm and not just
gain one time benefi t, they must become thorough professionals.
<p>Therefore, management must be regulated and controlled with auditing and benchmarking both
qualitative and quantitative indicators, taking the stakeholders perceptions into account. The success
of a fi rm will depend on its knowledge of these perceptions and the level of quality with which these </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management254
<p>are administered. Participative management, which includes all the stakeholders, provides the bedrock
of principled management necessary for the creation of wealth for the common good.
<p>A FIRM&rsquo;S RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS ITS
WORKERS AND CUSTOMERS
<p>Firms must look after the occupational safety and health of its workers. Workers in a noise-free, clean
atmosphere produce better results, adding to the profi ts of the fi rm. However, if the management
keeps a big difference between their home ambience and that of workplace, they are doing it at their
own risk. Firms have so far been taking care of their white-collared workers only, whereas it is the
blue-collared workers who produce the wealth of the fi rm. With reduced stress and fatigue levels,
and a happy working environment, workers get motivated to work. This also reduces union activity.
Exploitation of women workers by paying them less than their male counterparts for the same amount
of work, using child labour and denying children their right to education have been in existence for
too long and should not be tolerated any longer.
<p>Health and safety of the customers are also in jeopardy with unscrupulous fi rms ready to supply
substandard products. (Imagine a faulty electrical gadget, impure food items, spurious drugs and
immediately the essence of the problem would come into focus.) The safety and psychological well-
being of customers, who can buy products without fear of being cheated, is of paramount importance
to fi rms. Only this feeling can create sustainable loyal and profi table relationships.
<p>A manager must manage himself fi rst and then his fi rm, and only then can he have an enriching
infl uence on the fi rm&rsquo;s environment. The manager&rsquo;s own health and safety, linked with the health
and safety of his workers and customers, must be taken care of in a proactive manner, as they are
important in day-to-day management.
<p>Managers need to train themselves to focus on motivating the workers and improving their behav-
iour. Monitoring should be as much about the physical and psychological well-being of the individual
as about the usual accident statistics and costs incurred as a result. Business losses occur due to
accidents and absenteeism of the workers. Managers cannot shun their responsibilities for violating
international laws like laws governing intellectual property rights. China has been the biggest culprit
in this area but are we far behind? Pollution and nuclear wastes will take thousands of years to clean
up and till then they will keep affecting the stakeholders, the people of this planet.
<p>A sustainable-stakeholder fi rm proactively creates a caring workplace and fosters dialogical
mutually nurturing relationship with the customers.
<p>ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION
<p>Firms have been exploiting customers through ubiquitous and manipulating advertisements, at times
imposing the cultural values of the fi rm, which undermine the customers&rsquo; free choice and genuine
needs. Advertising, which is customer-inclusive and participative, would build lasting relation-
ships and increase the fi rm&rsquo;s market share on a long-term basis. The question bothering both the sellers
and buyer is the product cost versus price versus quality, and advertising based on the customer&rsquo;s
viewpoint would help solve the tangle.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Stakeholders 255
<p>SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS
<p>Firms need to provide products of outstanding quality to their customers and develop a seamless
relationship with their suppliers and business partners. This leads to market power, operational effi ciency
and creation of wealth. (In fi ve-star hotels, guest comments cards are available to enable the hotel to
improve the quality of service.) Quality is not some predetermined physical criteria; it is a refl ection
of products and processes, which satisfy and ideally delight the customers. Those needs and desires
in turn may be economic, social, physiological or psychological.
<p>For maintaining the quality in the product, the fi rm depends on its suppliers. In the new century,
there is a diffusion of traditional boundaries between fi rms and their suppliers as business partners.
From the era of suspicion of the suppliers, we are now in an era of mutuality and transparency, where
retailers and manufacturers are suppliers of goods and services as an extension of their operations.
<p>If, in a conventional fi rm, there is delivery of faulty products to the customers, and the fi rm has
tightly controlled boundaries with the suppliers and business partners, it would lead to market
atrophy and operational ineffi ciency. Firms must expand their web of economic relational intimacy
by incorporating the needs of customers, suppliers and business partners.
<p>GOVERNMENT AND THE SOCIETY
<p>Companies operating in host countries have a special responsibility towards the host country&rsquo;s stake-
holders. The host government needs to be nurtured well, else the chances of the company&rsquo;s success
in that country will be low.
<p>Firms, through political pressure, public relations and fi nancial muscle and infl uence, often un-
scrupulously and selfi shly manipulate their relationship with society, and the legislative process for
their narrow benefi ts. Firms&rsquo; enlightened self-interest would lead to more possibilities for wealth
creation, sustainable development and good management. Firms, which support the involvement of
the communities in which they operate, will help create a more vibrant local economy from which
they will inevitably derive benefi ts, moving beyond the paternalistic gift (social cause gift) mentality
and fully engaging the community. Firms must gift to the society without any expectations in return,
in an altruistic manner. Only then can the fi rm reap the benefi ts of increased brand equity. Firms
should make profi ts and then give a part of it back to the society. Gifts like a fl ash in the pan are not
going to help at all. Gifts, like adopting a village for literacy and health care, which make a difference
in the life of people concerned are really required. This happens when the fi rms have transparency in
their actions. (Most of the time, the major part of the money allotted for community welfare is used
for either personal benefi t, or in some corporate activity under the guise of helping others.)
<p>Partnerships between the fi rm and its stakeholders are going to become the most important drivers
for creation of wealth, sustainable development and good management in the future. In international
business, the goodwill of the banks, capital market system and the politics of trading blocks are be-
coming more useful than the country&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s partnerships. Firms are now becoming truly
multinational, not just for the nation, but for the world over. Americans buy more Japanese cars than
their own. National identity is trying to increase the differences to set the national loyalty back in focus
and they are even changing the rules of the game. However, the concepts of one world open business
could just be creeping, despite the power blocks and political differences. The world economy has to
cry out loud to see that these differences are removed and everybody gets a level-playing fi eld.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management256
<p>The management of each country should fundamentally be based on the cultural values of the
country and on the ground of spontaneous ability to maintain culture values. The use of modern tools
and techniques of communication will be suffi cient to compete successfully in the local and inter-
national competitive markets.
<p>Unfortunately several fi rms, who resist public opinion and government regulations, try to reshape
the communities and society, to feed their fi nancial bottom line. However, the unbounded self-interest
atrophies the profi tability and sustainability. Stakeholder fi rms utilise intimate dialogical and par-
ticipatory relationships with the stakeholders to build sustainable profi table fi rm.
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
<p>India does not need to be reminded of the great tragedy of Bhopal, when the gas leak at the Union
Carbide plant caused a huge loss of lives. After several years, even today the victims&rsquo; families are
trying to get compensation from the fi rm. The oil spills in the oceans caused by leakage in oil tankers
transporting oil in the world have brought about many catastrophes for the undersea fl ora and fauna,
disturbing the ecosystems of the affected areas.
<p>The physical environment and non-human species related issues are rapidly reshaping the
fundamentals of economics and business practices. Sustainability of the stakeholder system depends
on a deepening integration of environmental emergence and the fi rm&rsquo;s commitment to eco-friendly
stewardship. Unfortunately, some initiatives of business enterprises are divisive, defensive or down-
right disingenuous. Several people are trying to make quick money out of the real concerns of the
general citizens on the state of the planet.
<p>The benefi ts to business of effective environment management are the positive contribution to
the fi rm. Shared responsibility and values as the main planks of their culture would enhance the
reputation with the fi rm and its stakeholders leading to improved morale and greater loyalty, cost
saving&mdash;especially in energy and raw materials, market opportunities, contributions to effi ciency,
productivity and the fi rm&rsquo;s success.
<p>Task for Students
Analyse the role of a stakeholder-inclusive fi rm and discuss how it can outperform other fi rms.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>SUMMARY
<p>In the twenty-fi rst century, if any fi rm considers that it can thrive with only a profi t motive, it is sadly
mistaken. The ultimate test of success has shifted from profi t to stakeholders&rsquo; concerns. The CEO who
creates an environment of success with inputs from the stakeholders, is the one who will come out a
winner in the future. A stakeholder-inclusive management will have far better chances of success as
compared to a stakeholder-exclusive fi rm.</p>

<p>Quantitative Analysis
This is done to understand the viability of the fi rm and its intrinsic strengths and weaknesses.
A close look at the profi t and loss statement and the fi rm&rsquo;s balance sheet for the past few years
gives a clear picture. The following ratios need to be seen:
<p>1. Liquidity ratios:
<p> Current ratio = current assets/current liabilities (availability of current assets to pay current
liability).
<p> Quick ratio = current assets-inventory/current liabilities (ability to pay current liabilities
and inventories through current assets).
<p> Cash ratio = cash and cash equivalents/current liabilities (availability of cash to pay current
liabilities).
<p> Inventory to net working capital = inventory/current assets &ndash; current liabilities (affect of
changes in inventories on playability from current assets).
<p>2. Profi tability ratios:
<p> Net profi t margin = net profi t after tax/net sales.
Gross profi t margin = sales &ndash; cost of goods/net sales.
Return on investment = net profi t after taxes/total assets (rate of return, management
<p>effi ciency indicator).
Return on equity = net profi t after taxes/shareholders equity.
<p>3. Activity ratios:
<p> Inventory turnover = net sales/inventory.
Assets turnover = sales/total assets.
Account receivable turnover = annual credit sales/account receivable.
Fixed asset turnover = sales/fi xed assets.
<p>4. Leverage ratio:
<p> Debt equity ratio = total debts/shareholders equity.
Current liability to equity ratio = current liability/shareholders equity.
Earnings per share = total dividend declared/number of shares in the market with
<p>shareholders.
<p>Besides it is important to know the following:
<p>1. The fi rm&rsquo;s ability to raise additional capital.
2. Cost of the capital.
3. Relationship with creditors and stockholders.
4. Dividend policy.
5. Match between resources and usage of funds.

Brands have, in several cases, become synonymous with product quality and its usage. Brand plays
a major role in developing business worldwide, as students must have perceived, with the myriad of
international brands on offer in India that have taken a vice-like stranglehold on the customer&rsquo;s psyche.

<p>Note: &lowast; Stakeholders not affected by brand equity to any extent.
<p>PRIMARY SOCIAL STAKEHOLDERS
<p>Customers
<p>The group of people most affected by brand names is the customer group. They learn about a product,
its features and benefi ts it would provide to the customers. Brands often gain an emotional stranglehold
on the customers who fi nd it diffi cult to shake off the brand&rsquo;s hold on them. If a company&rsquo;s brand has
acquired the status of an emotional anchor for its customers, it is all for the good. However, if it is
the competitive brand that has occupied that place then the major task of the company is to dislodge
that brand and bring their own brand to the forefront. It must, however, be understood that brand
loyalty of customers has been diminishing fast over the last few decades. New, and at times, better
brands make their appearance in the market place with incessant regularity.
<p>A good product of acceptable quality that has sustained over long periods of time may do well
in the market even without a lot of advertising fanfare. However, advertising a good brand would
only add to its intrinsic value for the customers. The customers are looking for value for money and
a good brand provides additional value that goes much beyond the accepted benefi ts as it adds to
the prestige value of its buyers as well. Just imagine a buyer of a Mercedes car who feels proud of
his car even when he is not driving in it, as he knows the ownership of Mercedes puts him in a class
of his own.
<p>Suppliers
<p>Good brands that are well advertised cannot remain in hiding for long. The entire market place in-
cluding the raw material and component suppliers gets to know about the brand and its company. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 261
<p>A good brand that sells well makes the company cash-rich and the suppliers remain fully satisfi ed
regarding extending credit facility to the company. The suppliers are also sure that the company&rsquo;s
requirements would keep on increasing as long as the product stays in the growth and maturity
stage of its life cycle.
<p>In order to have the prestige of the product rub-off on them, suppliers too advertise their buyer&rsquo;s
names. The fact that they are the suppliers to such a prestigious company adds value to their own
operations. As a consequence, they get better terms from their supplier as they are in a position to
offer continuity of purchase that is dependent on the buying requirements of the company they are
supplying to. They can offer better payment terms as they get the same from the company.
<p>Suppliers do not have to spend a lot on selling nor have they to make a great deal of efforts as the
company keeps them supplied with orders as long as they keep to the required quality standards
and business terms.
<p>Investors
<p>A good brand is a guarantee that loan repayments and interest payments on the loan amount would
be made well within the stipulated period. Such assurances help the company investors in making
easy decisions regarding making investments in the company.
<p>Besides easy access to money, companies with a good brand name can get better terms for loans.
While the company has to provide the requisite collaterals towards the loan, the rigidity of the in-
vestors starts disappearing. Individual investors, like shareholders, look at investing their money
in these blue chip companies, that is, companies with a good brand name and place their trust in them.
They are assured of payment of dividends as well as of increase in share prices.
<p>Managers and Employees
<p>Managers of a company are the persons responsible for creating a good product for sale and a good
brand. Once the brand is established as a good one, the managers of the company enjoy the freedom
of getting the best employees to work in the company and getting the best trade partners. The employees
are normally willing to work for a company with a good brand name even at a lower salary package.
They believe that the prestige value of working in a company with a good brand name far outweighs
any monetary loss. They remain optimistic that in the long run the company will grow fast and with
it they too will grow.
<p>Managers are able to get the best trade partners, distributors, dealers and retailers because of the
good brand name of their company. The trade people believe that with a good brand they will enjoy
the following benefi ts:
<p> 1. Good sales with less effort.
2. Lower expense in advertising, sales training, low total selling costs.
3. They can obtain premium prices for the product, product line, brands and brand extensions,
<p>where prices are fi xed by the resellers on a cost plus basis.
4. Good brands provide entry barriers to outside companies when they fi nd that the possibility
<p>of market penetration is low; thus reducing the risk of new entrants.</p>
<br>

<p> 5. More profi ts through higher inventory turnover.
6. The stocks are always fresh.
7. Lower expenses in after-sales service.
8. More satisfi ed and happy staff, because with higher profi ts they get bigger pay packets
<p>and bonuses.
9. More satisfi ed customers who advertise the brand through word of mouth.
10. They can reduce their inventory levels by shedding some unprofi table brands.
11. Better product displays possible by using the brand&rsquo;s colour scheme.
12. With reduced sales time per customer, they can serve more customers.
13. Personal selling efforts become simplifi ed when the same approach, dialogue, statements,
<p>sequence of talk are kept for segment customers (that is, the canned approach). Such an ap-
proach has been used with success in the marketplace. Salespersons need to fi rm up their sales
talk almost in a brief repetitive repertoire (as customers do not give a lot of time to them give
their presentation) after several fi eld trials and then fi rm up the same for use in the future.
This is the canned approach.
<p>14. Trade channels can target better media as per the market segment, as the media would give
preference to good brands.
<p>Employees selling reputed brands are more satisfi ed than others. They develop pride in their work,
in the brand and hence can sell the brand with relative ease. With a buoyant company, employees feel
secure regarding their jobs and career prospects. They have a sense of belonging with respect to their
company and this accelerates their work speed, improves their quality of work and productivity.
<p>Local Communities
<p>Local communities and the public at large get indirect benefi ts from a company which sells brands of
good repute, apart from being able to purchase these brands. The company opens up job opportunities
to the residents of the locality where it operates. With a good organisation around itself, the citizenry
considers itself more safe and secure.
<p>Global Citizens
<p>Global citizens become aware of products of good brands coming from anywhere in the world and
they try to obtain the products to satisfy their needs. Brands help in international business in no
small measure. The success of Coca Cola, Pepsi, Nike, Ford, Chevrolet and Honda can be ascribed to
the good brand image these companies built up that was spread around the world. It enabled these
brands to reach a position of eminence in the world, wherever they chose to operate. With such brands,
international fi nancing, researching and locating managers worldwide becomes easy. Similarly, a good
brand helps in obtaining raw materials and components more easily. Outsourcing the manufacture
of the products or even sub-assemblies becomes easy.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 263
<p>As a good brand creates its own value, it helps the company in operating with a positive attitude
where developing new products through marketing research becomes a daily activity. Marketing
plans are organised with optimal precision to upgrade their market presence and improve their market
share. Personal selling and service get more focused with good support from most of the customers
who become loyal to the brand and the company. The customers therefore are ready to purchase new
products coming from the company with brand associations.
<p>Training of the sales and marketing team becomes unidirectional as the company forces its sales
direction towards the brand, its extension and its brand umbrella products.
<p>SECONDARY SOCIAL STAKEHOLDERS
<p>Host Government
<p>The host government gets benefi ts from a company with a good brand name as the company pays its
taxes and duties on time without delays. Besides, the government draws indirect support from good
companies by way of the social services they provide. Several companies in India maintain parks,
run hospitals, schools and charitable trusts.
<p>Society
<p>Society gains from a good brand as it can look forward to better products in the future from the same
company. They can also gain the company&rsquo;s support to become suppliers, sub-assemblers, outsourcing
agents and suppliers of human resources.
<p>Unions
<p>Unions fi nd that good companies with better brand equity are more amenable to improving the
condition of workers and therefore negotiations with the management of these companies is smooth
and needs less effort on the part of the unions.
<p>Media and Communicators
<p>Companies with good brand equity gain easier access to the media of their choice as the media,
including the press and audio-visual media fi nd these companies to be better paymasters and big
buyers of media, which in turn adds to their prestige too.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management264
<p>Trade Bodies
<p>Trade bodies like FICCI, ASSOCHAM and CII are funded by the corporate world. These bodies trust
good companies for getting timely fi nances for their operations. In times of need, these trade bodies
support them, albeit unwittingly, even more than they support other companies.
<p>Competitors
<p>Competitors gain from rival companies with a good brand equity as they keep them on their toes,
always keeping them alert. Competitive business has in the twenty-fi rst century become a sprint race
rather than a rat race. Ability to keep continuous vigil on competitive activities is what makes for a
good competitor.
<p>PRIMARY NON-SOCIAL STAKEHOLDERS AND SECONDARY
NON-SOCIAL STAKEHOLDERS
<p>Primary non-social stakeholders are the fl ora and fauna of the region that get disturbed or even
destroyed by pollution, which changes the ecological balance, creating untold problems for the
community, the country and the human race.
<p>The secondary non-social stakeholders are the trade bodies like FICCI, CII and ASSOCHAM that
help the fi rms in putting pressure on the government by raising issues concerning like-minded fi rms.
Besides they maintain statistical records about the industry as a help to the member fi rms.
<p>International Marketing Game 12.1
<p>Select a company in the international marketing business and understand how it is gaining
competitive advantage in the international market, using differentiation as its key factor.
<p>Differentiation
<p>Differentiation can be made in any of the 4Ps, in the fi fth P&mdash;personnel and in the service provided
by the fi rm. Differentiation in a product comes from technological innovations, aesthetics in product
design and profi les. Before the Kinetic Honda scooter came on the Indian roads, other scooters looked </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 265
<p>almost the same. Dove soap is declared to be not a soap; Ayurvedic cosmetics including shampoos
are unique products, differentiated from the usual run-of-the-mill products.
<p>Differentiation in price can be made by keeping either penetrating or skimming prices, giving
underhand discounts, long credit periods and product bundling.
<p>Distribution is differentiated by direct marketing, telemarketing, internet sales and interactive
sales through television channels.
<p>Advertising and promotion is full of differentiation as can be seen on any television channel,
magazine or newspaper. No two products or two advertisements are similar, as the sellers believe
that it is the uniqueness of advertising that catches the prospective customer&rsquo;s eyes.
<p>Differentiation can come from the following areas or actions:
<p>1. Unique product
2. Customer value
3. After-sales service
4. The fi rm&rsquo;s reputation
5. Brand equity
6. Status symbol
7. Technological innovation
8. Uniform quality of the product
<p>Differentiation can be achieved in both line and staff functions of a fi rm as given here:
<p> 1. Infrastructure: Extensive customer database.
2. Top management builds its image through personal actions.
3. Human resource management encourages high-quality production through training and
<p>incentives.
4. Technology helps to produce products much superior to those of the competition.
5. Technology patents ensure that the competition does not produce duplicates.
6. Purchase of only branded components.
7. Cost-effective media planning for advertising the products.
8. Superior quality raw materials and components.
9. Products conforming to their specifi cations.
10. Just in time (JIT) supplies from vendors.
11. Effective advertising.
12. Timely and courteous service.
<p>Brand loyalty brings less sensitivity to price changes. Differentiation brings with it barriers for
newcomers to enter the race.
<p>INTERNATIONAL BRANDS
<p>Brand value or equity of a product is almost a permanent asset for a company (till something much
better and lower in cost comes along in the market place). Thus, the stored value, like a tag can be
utilised for gaining the same support for other products from the company by offering it under the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management266
<p>same brand name. However, in case the extended product does not come up to the expectations of
the customers, the use of brand extension could prove counterproductive, almost disastrous for the
company.
<p>Customers used to a brand would take the other product under the same brand name or brand
umbrella as having the same level of quality and providing similar type of satisfaction to them.
However, the success of an extended brand would come only from the money spent by the company,
the importance given to the product development process. Therefore companies would be well advised
to pre-test the brand extension products as these tests would not only give the company assurance of
successful extension but would augment the brand value even further.
<p>Based on this brand can be defi ned a set of images and associations linked to a commercial product.
It has the following special features:
<p>1. Brand distinguishes the product from similar other products.
2. Brand creates specifi c customer needs and expectations of their fulfi lment.
3. Brand can predict buyers&rsquo; behaviour of buying the product or just avoiding it.
<p>Brand equity can be defi ned as the stored value built up in a brand for achieving competitive
advantage. It is diffi cult to quantify, as there can be several ways of gaining brand equity as given
next:
<p>1. Resilience of the brand, its intrinsic strength as compared to the competitive brands.
2. Trials and test marketing of new products as brand extensions.
3. Premium prices secured by the company for the existing branded product and brand extended
<p>products.
4. Leverage of brands in gaining access to the best channels of distribution.
5. Access to the best media required by the target market segment at reasonable rates.
<p>Brand equity, as it is known today, and the company&rsquo;s goodwill as it was known in the early part
of the twentieth century, has a complex relationship between the product, the company, its service
and its customers, and hence it becomes diffi cult to place it on a graduated scale. The other interesting
point about brand value is that the company acquiring or buying a brand fi nds it more relevant than
the company that possesses the brand.
<p>Brands provide leverage for brand extensions, as several products can be sold under the brand
umbrella. For example, Coca Cola offers under the same brand Cola Lite and Coke. The company
offers orange and lemon drinks, too, but uses a different brand name for those products. While brand
extensions offer the customers an equally satisfying product and service quality, in case the extended
product fails it could affect the main brand product adversely. If Diet Coke fails in India, the company
can blame it on Indian taste or the water used in making the product. With the superior hype given
to Coca Cola, minor mishaps would in all probability not diminish its brand equity at all.
<p>Success of products using brand extensions is also dependent on the company&rsquo;s marketing efforts.
Brand heredity, however, remains useful for keeping the extensions in the customers &lsquo;top of the mind
recall&rsquo; zones.
<p>At times, there is little to choose between two brands. For instance, there is little to choose between
Coke and Pepsi, as both are bottled water-based soft drinks. Brand equity therefore depends on the
consumer&rsquo;s viewpoint of brand competence, brand personality (in the case of Coke, the taste, its
viscosity, its colour can be taken as projections of the product&rsquo;s personality), styling of the packaging </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 267
<p>and the like. Brand equity or brand value can help in the consumer&rsquo;s approval of the extended brands.
However, companies would be wise to organise marketing research for getting the consumer&rsquo;s
understanding of the brand extensions and similarity of consumer equations between the main brand
product and the brand extension products. If there is more than one brand extension, each one would
require a separate marketing research to understand the brand extensions thrust on the consumer&rsquo;s
psyche. It can therefore be safely said that marketing research for brand value should become a
continuous process in a progressive company.
<p>The marketing research process should evaluate the consumer factors for brand extensions as
discussed next:
<p>1. Qualitative research should help evolve the brand extension channels, usage boundaries
between main and extended products, extension limits like similarity in usage or complementary
usage (toothpaste and toothbrush). The research should also discover new approaches to
marketing techniques, like brand extension pricing, promotion and projections of brand equity
enhancement or depreciation with the brand extensions.
<p>2. Quantitative research should quantify the results of the qualitative research.
3. Secondary analysis should be undertaken to narrow down the number of products or product
<p>categories that should be permissible per brand beyond which the brand extensions would
cease to have any effect on the consumers.
<p>Companies should have brand competencies and brand personality as their research goals. If the
brand defi nes a single product, then what is the special quality and attributes of the product that
help the product deliver the benefi ts and also opens up opportunities for continuous usage and any
additional benefi ts? The researcher should take the brand personality in account while conducting
the research. For example, Heinz ketchup, besides its tanginess, has a viscosity, which ensures that
the ketchup does not drip like other ketchups in the market. Advertisers use the personality as they
project creative images for the customers. This gives them the opportunity of not only describing the
features and attributes of the product but also creatively disclose the benefi ts the customers are going
to derive from the product. The Hero Honda brand is trendy, youthful and sleek, and is meant for
young bikers. IBM is a sober brand that is known for its good service and responsiveness. Pepsi, as a
brand, is aimed at teenagers and those who want to have fun!
<p>Product personality images can come from the following:
<p>1. Product specifi cations and design
2. Packaging
3. Technology
4. Sales team
5. Advertisements
6. Target market segment
7. Product applications and usage
<p>However, if the brand or brand extension behaviour becomes inconsistent then it loses its appeal
and takes the customers by surprise. Brand extensions need to have the same styling, otherwise the
extended brands will fail inspite of product competence. Brand competence and styling may not
refl ect the performance of the product at all. Brand, should therefore be separated from the product
to match with additional products. In such cases, a company brand can cover the entire range of
products like the Godrej brand.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management268
<p>Given next is an example of brand personality that can be used to project the brand:
<p>Ragu pasta sauce has been created with recipe dimensions as given here:
<p>1. It is a rich, thick sauce.
2. It contains only tomatoes.
3. It is sweet in taste.
4. It has added spices that enhance its taste.
5. It uses only fresh ingredients.
<p>The character of the sauce can, therefore, be described as:
<p>1. It is Italian.
2. The manufacturers have expertise on the subject of tomatoes.
3. The manufacturers are pioneers in the fi eld of sauce making.
4. The sauce is considered as sophisticated and contemporary.
<p>The marketing research team should use projective techniques during questionnaire-fi lling time
by giving the respondents key metaphors1 for describing the product. One research report had sug-
gested that the users of the sauce were people with fi nesse and had savoured intellectual achievements,
while the non-users were full of aggression. The researchers had used an exploratory qualitative
research technique.
<p>PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUES
<p>One method of structured disguised questions is the use of the projective technique. These are most
useful when the stimuli provided to the respondents are not clear or cannot be defi ned accurately.
Else, the stimulus is not complete, is vague and yet it is important to accurately understand the
responses of the respondents. Most purchases made by us have an element of subconscious content
in decision-making and the respondents do not disclose their true feelings as the answers may refl ect
negatively on them or they want to please the interviewer with the right answer or they may not be
even aware of their unconscious feelings.
<p>In the projective technique, no direct questions are asked on the subject. Since the answers are for
a vague stimulus, they tend to come from the heart and depict the true feelings, beliefs and attitudes
of the respondents. So the main features of the projective technique are:
<p>1. Unclear stimulus.
2. Incomplete stimulus.
3. Interpretation of response is important.
4. No direct questions.
<p>1 Metaphors can be defi ned as the application of a word or phrase to somebody or something that is not meant
literally, but to make a comparison, for example, &lsquo;somebody is a snake&rsquo;. Second, metaphors are all languages
that involve fi gures of speech or symbolism, and do not literally represent the real thing. Finally, metaphors can
be the things used or considered to represent another thing.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 269
<p>5. Answers are projected in vague stimulus.
6. Answers are based on true beliefs and attitudes.
<p>Given next are some of the projective techniques used in marketing research.
<p>TYPES OF PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUES
<p>1. Comment on a third person&rsquo;s behaviour: When it is assumed that the respondent is not likely to
open up on a delicate subject it is best to ask him about the possible response of a third person,
who the respondent knows well enough, or whose behaviour can be judged by the respond-
ent. An interviewer made two shopping lists for two sets of women shoppers. They included
Nescaf&eacute; Mix in one and plain Nescaf&eacute; in another. The interviewer asked the respondent about
what she thought of the two groups of buyers. While preliminary reports had shown Nescaf&eacute;
Mix as lacking taste, the actual picture came from these interviews: The woman with Nescaf&eacute; on
her list was considered as practical, a housewife who was economical, while the person who
bought Nescaf&eacute; Mix was perceived as being lazy, a spendthrift and a show-off. The fact that
the product was a time-saving one and the issue of the product&rsquo;s taste got sidelined. Marketers
had to take note of these true feelings in their business communication plans for changing the
attitudes of a majority of women.
<p>2. Word association: This technique is used for selecting brand names, advertisement slogans and
themes, and for measuring attitudes towards a particular product, package or advertisement. For
example, a whiskey maker tested the brand names Frost, Verve, Ultra and Master&rsquo;s Choice for his
clear-coloured whiskey. Frost was seen as a modern, upbeat name and the right choice to touch
the respondent&rsquo;s psyche, while Verve was common and Master&rsquo;s Choice was not bouncy enough.
<p>3. Benefi t stepladder: This is a version of word chain association. The respondent is asked about
all the benefi ts he derives by using a product. Then he has to give two more benefi ts for each
benefi t. This keeps going on till no more benefi ts can be named. One benefi t of a luxury car
could be lifestyle projection. When asked about the benefi t of lifestyle projection, the respondent
may say that it gives higher status, which in turn may evoke the response of improvement in
business prospects. A toothpaste may have fresh breath as a benefi t, which may result in the
respondent talking about gaining confi dence leading to making new friends easily, added to
which could be having a great time. Marketers can use the information in product positioning
and for brand advertising.
<p>4. Sentence completion: In this technique, the respondents are asked to complete an incomplete
sentence. Direct questions on topics like cigarettes and liquor may not get the right response,
as smokers and drinkers would say that since they enjoy these, why should anyone else
have any objection? They might say that moderation is okay or that their pleasure is important
to them. When the same people are asked to complete the sentence, &lsquo;people who never smoke
are __________&rsquo;, the comments might be: they are better off, happier, smarter, wiser, more in-
formed. Question like, &lsquo;teenagers who drink are__________&rsquo; got the response that they are
foolish, stupid, crazy, immature, showing off, wrong.
<p>5. Story completion: As the name suggests, the respondents are told a part of the story. Since
they do not know how the people in the story react, they have to create the end of the story
based on their own experiences and attitudes. It gives an insight into the buying behaviour of
the respondents in a subtle way. Suppose a new sports car is introduced in the market with
innovative features and it sparks off a great degree of interest in the car. But the car does not sell. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management270
<p>A story can be made that a family consisting of a husband, wife and their two teenage children
are returning from a car showroom when the wife says, &lsquo;the car is nice, but__________&rsquo; and the
interviewer asks the respondent to complete the story. Firms have used this technique for de-
veloping new successful products.
<p>6. Story making: In this technique, the respondent is asked to construct a story, dialogue or descrip-
tion, which offers more leverage to the respondent than what he gets in the story completion
technique. A method used is of cartoon blurbs. In the case of cartoon blurbs, one or more cartoons
are shown to the respondents, where one character says something and the bubble above the
other character is blank, which the respondent has to fi ll in. The person can write whatever comes
to his mind, irrespective of whether it is guided by the subconscious or is socially wrong.
<p>7. Third person technique: Most people feel confi dent when they have to comment on another
person&rsquo;s actions or viewpoints. The other person could be a neighbour, an average woman, a
boss or a teacher. Questions that may evoke a hostile reaction can be asked in this manner using
the third person technique.
<p> Most people feel offended when asked about their unnecessary spending on luxuries instead
of saving for the future. Using this technique, respondents were asked what they thought others
were splurging on. The information thus received was more indicative of what respondents
were spending on themselves.
<p>8. Picture response: In this case, pictures are shown to elicit response from the respondents as
stories, which they can make up after seeing the pictures.
<p>9. Fantasy narration: Respondents are asked to talk about their fantasy about a product or a brand.
10. Metaphors: Researchers can draw out metaphors from respondents by asking them to visually
<p>represent their experiences with a product by cutting and pasting pictures from magazines. In
the US, women were asked why they wear pantyhose and the response was negative: &lsquo;they wear
them because they have to, and they hate them&rsquo;. During the metaphor study, they agreed that
wearing pantyhose made them feel sensual, sexy and more attractive to men. This information
was of a lot of value to the makers of pantyhose.
<p>11. Personifi cation: The respondents are asked about the personality they associate with a particu-
lar brand. They are asked to give a description of the buyers of a particular brand. They can be
shown a photo gallery of different personalities from which they can make their choice.
<p>12. Consumer drawings: These can show the hidden motives or perceptions of the respondents.
When asked to draw what happens when they use an insecticide, many women drew pictures
of the men in their lives undergoing physical pain revealing a lot of the feelings of the powerless
frustrated group.
<p>13. Thematic apperception test: This is used mainly for understanding psychological problems and
hence is not used in market research too often. The respondents are shown a series of pictures
and they are asked to provide a description or a story about the pictures.
<p>PROBLEMS OF PROJECTIVE TECHNIQUES
<p>Since a lot of psychoanalysis is required during the projective process, the following are the problems
that researchers face during the research process. Trained interviewers are needed for projective
techniques and they are expensive. The high costs result in having a smaller sample, with increased
possibility of errors. Besides the other causes of errors are given below:
<p>1. Mostly non-probability sample add to errors.</p>
<br>

<p>2. Respondent&rsquo;s unwillingness.
3. Interpreter&rsquo;s bias.

<p>BUILDING BRAND LOYALTY
<p>The business theory associated with building brand loyalty starts with the information about who are
the customers, where the market is, what satisfaction the customers are looking for and how much
they are willing to pay for the same. After getting the answers for these questions through marketing
research, the company positions the product in the market place as discussed next:
<p>1. Find out the right market segment for the product.
2. Focus the 4Ps directly towards the selected segment. For example, the product and its pack-
<p>aging should be directly as per the needs and requirements of the segment customers. The
distribution channels should be selected with the best access to the segment customers and
the advertising campaign should use the media best suited to the segment customers and the
message should refl ect the language best understood by the customers.
<p>3. Offering surprise gifts, extra unasked for guarantee and replicating these every time a purchase
is made can strengthen brand loyalty. However, the most important ingredient for brand loyalty
will always be top-quality unsolicited service with courtesy provided to the customers. Imagine
a general manager of a hotel who, whenever he is free, seeks out guests, personally serves
them the dishes they order, helps them carry their luggage in case the bell boy is not present
for whatever reason. Or can you visualise a senior doctor wheeling in his patient in the absence
of a ward boy.
<p>Sales promotion plays an important role in building brand loyalty. The sellers should be able to
assess the time when the customer loyalty is on the decline and at that point of time they should start
a promotion campaign to bind the customers likely to drift away to the competition.
<p>The sellers should plan the following activities in the decline stage of brand loyalty:
<p>1. Understanding the reasons for the decline with the help of marketing research, focusing on the
specifi c requirements of the customers and then, without any loss of time, modifying the 4Ps
to suit the customers.
<p>2. Product innovation or giving something extra, like an accessory with the product. Product or
service differentiation.
<p>3. Personalised service tailor-made to suit the individual customers, tastes, moods, personality
and status are offered. In some hotels, for example, for well-known guests, the checking is done
in the hotel rooms or suites allotted to them and not in the lobby as is customary everywhere. </p>

<p>The guests are taken directly to their rooms, offered a complimentary drink and then they are
requested to sign the registration coupon. You treat your guest or customer like a lord and
you may end up becoming one, as your custom grows along with your profi ts in geometric or
spiralling proportion.
<p>POSITIONING STRATEGY
<p>Positioning strategy for a brand can be organised as follows:
<p>The defi ning idea could be the satisfaction or delight level of customers along with the advertising
slogan.
<p>The market category would decide the following areas:
<p>1. Endorsements of the product: Who are the best community leaders for endorsing the product,
the people who would relate to the attitudes, thinking process, desires and needs of the
customers.
<p>2. Proof of the product&rsquo;s success in usage through customer certifi cates.
3. Certification from technology research organisations regarding the product&rsquo;s quality
<p>standards.
<p>The brand can be for a product or a group of products or for a company. The company has to decide
on methods to build a naming convention that would include the following:
<p>1. Product features.
2. Product attributes.
3. Product benefi ts for the customers.
4. Service that goes with the product sales.
<p>In advertising campaigns, the message should cover the demographic segmentation along with the
other segments like geographic, psychographics, income and benefi t segments. The customers must
be given the right inputs through the campaigns. The media used should have effective presence in
the segment and allow for product exposure on a long-term basis.
<p>The company can acquire moral leadership of the product by meeting the aspirations of the
customers and offering them quick redress of complaints.
<p>Most chief executive offi cers (CEOs) have understood the importance of having and continuously
improving a good brand and therefore have taken the role of leading brands upon themselves. Brand
becomes a bond between the buyers and the seller.
<p>Brand interests focus on relationships, the current theme of marketing&mdash;relationship marketing&mdash;
that could be as given next:
<p>1. One to one in case of the service industry and at times in the case of business-to-business
situations.
<p>2. One-to-many in the case of the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry.</p>
<br>

<p>International Marketing Management274
<p>Customisation of brands in case of consumer durables could be affected by offering customers
customised brands that could have a combination of the brand&rsquo;s name and the customer&rsquo;s name.
As an example, LG could sell their specially-made refrigerator for Mr Gupta as LG Gupta refrigerator.
Maruti could sell its Esteem as Esteem-Mathur to Mr Mathur. Wrapping the product with specially
printed paper with a message like &lsquo;specially packaged LG TV for Mr Verma&rsquo;, can make the cus-
tomisation of the brand and packaging more easy. It can even go to the extent of saying, &lsquo;specially
selected components for Mr Verma used in the TV&rsquo;. Certain large retail chains get products made
which carry the retail chain&rsquo;s brand imprint. Companies that sell to these retailers fi nd it diffi cult to
establish their brands, unless there is dual branding for products, one for the company and one for the
retail chain. The company&rsquo;s brand effect, however, gets diluted by doing so and hence is undertaken
only for really big outlets with large volume sales.
<p>A good acceptable brand spreads and fl ows to cover the segment through advertising and word-
of-mouth publicity. Brand story telling process starts with awareness and goes through the following
milestones: It starts with awareness then it goes to involvement followed by trial of the product,
leading to commitment, interest to positioning in the person&rsquo;s psyche, leading to product adoption
and communication with friends and relatives before it goes through the repeat purchase process.
<p>A company&rsquo;s CEO has to recognise the brand identity and use the proper channels as discussed
next:
<p>1. Advertising, promotion, personal selling.
2. Publicity, packaging, retailing, training the retailer&rsquo;s sales team.
3. Industrial package design, product aesthetics, counselling the prospective buyers.
<p>Brands get their focus and strength from the following:
<p>1. Product names.
2. Trademarks.
3. Branded components used.
4. Affi liate names that gain strengths from the more famous &lsquo;big brother&rsquo; brand names of the
<p>company as compared to competitive brand names.
5. Phonetic spelling like seezers for scissors, cofi for coffee.
6. Misspellings like Kwality Restaurant.
7. Homonyms, that is, names that are spelt alike but mean different things.
8. Family names like Birla, Tata, Modi.
<p>Good brands are created by interaction between the design team of the company or its advertising
agency. It can take the process and people of the company into account. Once the team has suggested
a brand name, it is carefully spread in the localised market place and feedback is taken about its
effectiveness from the following:
<p>1. Selected customers
2. Trade partners
3. Service providers
4. Media planners
5. Discussion forum
6. Focus groups
7. Stakeholders</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 275
<p>Researchers can use top-of-the-mind recall questions and get answers from the selected customers
and stakeholders and the feedback can be used to take a decision about the brand name.
<p>Creating brand loyalty requires interface with the product users from among the community
members where the company operates. Besides this, time needs to be spent studying the customers&rsquo;
purchase process, the products they buy, the price they pay and their usual business terms during
such purchase action.
<p>It is useful to learn the profi les of the customers as discussed next:
<p>1. Demographic
2. Technographic
3. Preference yardstick
4. Possible substitute products and brands in the customer&rsquo;s mind
5. Expectation options regarding product benefi ts for the customers
<p>Companies must understand the primacy of selling locations as they represent distance travelled
and time spent on each purchase. Does the seller accept any penalty clause in case of non- or below
par performance of the product? The other areas for brand strengthening are:
<p>1. Information on product updates.
2. Replacement of unacceptable products.
3. Proper documentation of such defects.
4. Help desks for getting redress on complaints.
5. Reduction in search costs incurred by the customer before he actually makes the purchase.
<p>No company can ignore the buyer factor in determining its brand policy. A company has to create
value with its brand for the customers. For this purpose, it needs to get continuous feedback regard-
ing the brand&rsquo;s effi cacy in the market segment for which the product is meant. Good brands get into
a win&ndash;win situation as the customers become loyal while at the same time they help to add more
customers to the list of the product&rsquo;s users through word-of-mouth publicity. Companies further
augment their brand equity by proclaiming to the customers and prospective customers that in
case of any problem the company guarantees 24 hour replacement, seven days a week without any
problem and without questioning the customer. It may be understood that these companies are so
sure of their product quality that they can offer easy replacements knowing fully well that such an
event is highly unlikely to happen.
<p>Brand names should become the product identity and for that purpose they should be relevant,
simple, trusted through high quality of product and customer service. Brands reduce or can even
eliminate the competitive risk factor. However, the level of identity should not be such that it makes
the brand a generic name, for instance all hydrogenated vegetable oils are called Dalda and all motor
oils are referred to as Mobiloil although both Dalda and Mobiloil are only brand names.
<p>The seller of a good brand should feel privileged and this feeling can be achieved by the following
means:
<p>1. Pre-release special test marketing.
2. First-use premium.
3. Availability of search tools, like industry diaries, press releases, internet browsing tools.
4. Availability of product, timing the product launch to coincide with the festive season, or time
<p>when companies pay bonuses to their employees.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management276
<p>5. A company can think of a limited edition of the product or it can fl ood the market with it. This
could create curiosity in the customer&rsquo;s minds or it could make the customer believe that the
product has no takers.
<p>6. The company has to decide if it wants to market the product in the local market, nationally or
in the international market. Brand names need to be selected accordingly. In the international
market the brand name could mean different things in different languages and this should be
a major consideration while selecting a brand name for the international market.
<p>If a company sells several brands then it should fi nd if any cross-reference of brands is possible or
not, as it could be used to augment the brand value.
<p>USE OF BEST PRACTICES
<p>Best practices for the development of brands are:
<p>1. The brand name itself should add value to the product. When a customer buys the product,
the purchase should boost his ego, his status as a person and refl ect his intellect as a discern-
ing buyer. The brand should reduce the product selection time, save money spent in searching
for the product, avoid the need for testing the product and give consistent quality of product
and service.
<p>2. The brand management should be ready to provide high-quality service seven days a week,
24 hours a day to enable customers to fruitfully use the product continuously.
<p>3. The product should match international quality standards even if it is for local sale, as it must
be able to successfully face international competition in the domestic market.
<p>4. Product marketing efforts, including sales promotion, advertising, personal selling, publicity
and public relations, must all be integrated for the achievement of the common goal of the
company. Brands should provide the core for such efforts.
<p>5. Brand development activities should be done on a time frame basis to keep tracking the market
position of the brands.
<p>INTEGRATED FOCUSED COMMUNICATION
<p>Business communication is carried out between the sellers and the buyers. Advertisements, promotion
and personal selling are some of the ways in which this is accomplished. The main purpose of
communication is to improve brand benefi t valuation by the buyers. Second, the brand should reduce
the thinking time of the buyers.
<p>Advertising is used to evoke positive feelings for products and minimise or totally eliminate
negative thoughts about them. As the customer uses a product, he gains experience in its usage.
If the experience is interesting and a happy one, it leaves a positive attitude towards the brand in the
customer&rsquo;s mind. The customer starts looking at advertisements about that product to further rein-
force their attitude and belief about that product. In such situations, the product goes into the psyche
of the customer and &lsquo;gets the top billing for brand recall&rsquo;.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Brands 277
<p>Such brand reinforcement helps the company in improving the peripheral and associative effect
that covers the brand extensions under the brand umbrella, homogenising the stranglehold of the com-
pany&rsquo;s products on the customers. Such advertisements create a conditioning effect as the customer&rsquo;s
mind gets conditioned to receive the message given through the advertisements in the manner it is
meant to be received. Hence, the repeat value of advertisements leads to conditioning and associative
effects that help in selling the brand extensions too with the same brand equity. Advertising cam-
paigns create an aura, help in repositioning not only products but also customers&rsquo; feelings about a
company&rsquo;s products.
<p>A good example of brand repositioning is from the US, where a soft drink company was selling the
drink 7 UP. Most people felt that it was a lemon drink for the elderly. However, a survey showed
the company that lot of people preferred non-cola soft drinks. They started calling 7 UP an &lsquo;Un-cola&rsquo; soft
drink and targeted a wide market segment including teenagers and improved their market share.
<p>International Marketing Game 12.2
<p>The team should understand the way the company is trying to create cost leadership. Most of
the discerning customers are looking for value for money products. With better looks and mass
production, Japan has taken a lead in car entertainment electronics and watch sales the world over.
With lower production costs, they are able to use the money for research and development, product
innovations and for fi ghting price wars if required. Cost is built up of two factors:
<p>1. Fixed costs
2. Variable costs
<p>The fi xed costs include the cost of money, salaries, rentals and depreciation, while variable
costs include cost of raw materials, labour and consumables. Fixed costs per unit of manufacture
get reduced when the economies of production scale are achieved and variable cost gets reduced
with the effect of experience curve.
<p>Suppose the total fi xed cost of manufacturing 10,000 cars is Rs 3,000,000. The fi xed cost per car
comes to Rs 300. Now if the production is increased by 20 per cent, that is, to 12,000 cars and if
the fi xed cost does not change, then the fi xed cost per car would come to Rs 250 per car (worked
in a straight-line method). Such an ideal situation may not occur as an increase of production by
30&ndash;40 per cent would result in an increase in the total fi xed cost to some extent with an increase
in the number of shift managers, requirement for bigger fl oor space and the like. The fi rm can get
the benefi t of larger purchase of raw materials, bigger, and hence cheaper, advertising campaigns
because of the bulk rates offered by the media.
<p>Variable costs decreases due to the time experience factor. When the workers start the
manufacture, in the initial stages the rejection rates are high. As they become familiar with the manu-
facturing process the rejection rate falls and this decreases the cost of raw materials and labour.
<p>(continued)</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management278
<p>A typical example is of electronic semiconductor devices. In the beginning the rejection used to be
up to 70 per cent and hence the price of integrated circuits was between Rs 200&ndash;300. Today, when
the rejection rate has reduced to 1 to 2 per cent, the prices have come down to Rs 20&ndash;30 only.
<p>Firms use the low-cost benefi t to their advantage as follows:
<p>1. Enjoying extra profi t and using it for expansion.
2. Innovating the product and other Ps for maintaining their market share.
3. Cross Parry, that is, fi ghting price wars. This is done by hitting the competition at its weak
<p>links if they start a price war and hitting the competing fi rm in its vulnerable market.
<p>Costs leadership in fi rm works as follows:
<p>1. Flatter fi rm, less costs.
2. Employee-oriented policies to reduce their turnover.
3. Training to reduce wastage and increase productivity.
4. Long-term relationship with the vendors.
5. Economies of scale in production.
6. Experience curve to reduce variable costs.
7. Long-term advertising budgets for lowering costs.
8. Expert servicing for being right always.

<p>13 International Marketing Concepts
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
The study of this chapter will help students understand marketing from an international perspective
as it deals with some basic concepts and useful ideas. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management280
<p>To understand marketing it is useful to understand some basic concepts and useful ideas:
<p>MARKET SEGMENTATION
<p>Market segmentation is required because products can be used or are needed by only a part of the
entire population. The concept of segmentation focuses on the particular group or class of customer
who would be defi nitely interested in the product. A history textbook will be of interest to students
and teachers of history. Spices used in cooking will be needed by cooks, both in homes and in hotels.
Can a customer group afford to buy a product although it may be requiring the same? For example, can
low-income people buy an expensive watch worth Rs 4,000? The population can therefore be divided
on the basis of whether they belong to a rich income group, poor income group or mid-income group.
Depending on the product to be sold, further narrower classifi cation can be done.
<p>TARGETING MARKETS
<p>Markets have evolved from purely physical locations where buying and selling took place to super-
markets where a lot of products from diverse manufacturers are sold under one roof. Then there
are need-based markets like healthcare products market, sports goods market. Markets can be for
different age groups, different religious groups. Today there are also people markets, where jobs are
offered to jobseekers. Marketers have to decide which market they want to sell their products and
these become the targets for the fi rm.
<p>CUSTOMERS AND PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS
<p>These are the people or organisations that either need a product or could be brainwashed into buy-
ing a product. As they have a number of sources from whom they can buy, the sellers need to have
really effi cient persuasion or brainwashing techniques in order to get them to buy their products.
At times, buyers are also users, but it is not always so. For example, one family member might be
buying toiletries, which are used by the rest of the family. The decision to buy one particular brand
could be the buyer&rsquo;s, or it could be of the family member who uses that product; in India servants
do a lot of the shopping for the family they work for and they are mostly guided by the dictates of
the family members.
<p>WHAT THE CUSTOMERS NEED
<p>Starting from the physical needs of food, clothing, shelter, healthcare and education, people have a
need for recreation, sports, entertainment and other leisure-time activities. Sellers stimulate these needs
by educating the customers through advertisements and personal selling. Some basic products like </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 281
<p>food are demanded by the buyers. However, the choice of branded food keeps increasing, for example,
for a product as common as salt several brands are available. Sellers keep focusing the attention of
buyers on their product by communicating with them about their brands. Demand creation is done
for totally new and innovative products like cellphones. For cellphones, a lot of concept selling about
the product usage was done even before the product was offered in the market. It must be accepted
that somewhere in the mindset of the target customers the latent need for cellphones existed. At times,
however, with demand growth and increased competition, improved or more innovative products
have to be introduced in the market, which helps in retaining or improving the fi rm&rsquo;s market share.
Firms with better research and development facilities fare better in competitive situations. Attractive
products or good-looking packages help in selling as they catch the customer&rsquo;s eyes. Apart from this,
social and peer pressure gives buyers the required motivation for buying a product, even if they do
not really need it. Credit cards or other credit sales make people/customers buy more than their need
or more than they can actually afford and hence several social scientists consider pressure selling as
an incurable modern-day malaise.
<p>PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
<p>Products and services satisfy the customer&rsquo;s needs or provides the benefi t sought by the customer.
Branded products have an identity of their own and their sales can be quantifi ed accurately. Firms
look for enhancing the value of their brand through its quality, advertising and personal sales.
<p>PRODUCT BENEFITS AND ITS VALUE TO THE CUSTOMERS
<p>This is an important area for sellers as the greater is the customer&rsquo;s perception of the product having
value for money, the greater are the chances of his buying the product. Value to the customer can be
defi ned as:
<p>Value = product benefi ts and its emotional value to the buyer as compared to its cost
to the customer, including the cost of time and effort.
<p>SALES CONTRACTS
<p>For sales to be made in a legally valid and binding manner, the following conditions must be met:
<p> There must be at least two parties to the contract, both have something for the other; one may
have a product and the other money to buy the product.
<p> Each party can offer its product/money and also accept the offer.
Each party accepts the other as a reasonable party and the contract as genuine and
<p>reasonable.
The product or service on offer is not a contraband item like drugs or an illegal activity like an
<p>offer to kill someone. Hence, it can be seen that when one party gives a gift to another party it </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management282
<p>cannot be considered a sale as there is no payment involved in the transfer of goods from one
party to the other.
<p>The ideal sought by sellers is that the buyers become their friends and to do so they sell quality
products, offer good service and attractive terms of business, which, over a period of time makes their
customers their friends interested in a long-term relationship with them.
<p>RELATIONSHIP MARKETING
Relationship marketing has become the keyword in today&rsquo;s marketing language with a lot of effort
and money going in to it. Marketers having to cover a large geographic area need to have sales out-
lets at numerous places in their target market place. They need a distribution channel, which goes up
to the retail stores where the customers go to buy their products. New channels like the internet and
teleshopping have come up to enable customers to have interactions with the sellers without them
having to take time off to do shopping. Sellers need to communicate to the buyers all the time about
their products, their benefi ts and prices, which is done through personal selling at the retail outlets
and through advertisements. Interactive channels like the internet and teleshopping help customers
gather information about products and also buy them.
<p>COMPETITION
As there are several sellers of the same product, the customers have those many choices. It is competi-
tion that keeps fi rms on their toes, as they have to constantly endeavour to provide a good product
at a reasonable price from which the customers can derive benefi ts they want and which makes them
happy and delighted. Competition can be of several types:
<p>1. Similar product competition where competitive products offer same or similar benefi ts to the
customer at the same type of prices. In the Indian automobile sector, Maruti Zen, Santro, Matiz
and Indica are in the same competition bracket.
<p>2. Same industry competition where the fi rms make the same products. For cars, all the car
manufacturers, irrespective of the size and price become competitors.
<p>3. Usage competition is where different products providing similar usage are considered to be in
competition. For cars, motorcycles, scooters, buses become competition.
<p>4. Competition for customer&rsquo;s money is where different products compete for the customer&rsquo;s
money. For example, car sellers can consider sellers of consumer products or vacation travel
as competition as they too want the customer&rsquo;s money.
<p>MARKET ENVIRONMENT
Competition is a signifi cant factor that creates the business environment for the fi rm. Besides, its
suppliers, buyers, new competitors planning to enter the fi eld and substitute product sellers make
up the environment in which a fi rm operates.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 283
<p>The general environment factors that affect marketing are demographic, socio-cultural and political-
legal factors, the country&rsquo;s economics, technology and global business. Marketing mix factors are the
factors that assist the marketing team in achieving the targets.
<p>Marketing Mix Factors
<p>In each of the product cases, there are some common and some different factors for profi table sales.
These are called the marketing mix factors, which can be compared with ingredients like herbs, oil,
condiments, vegetables and meat, using which a chef can cook a delicious meal. Similarly, the marketing
manager can plan profi table sales using the following factors, known as marketing mix factors:
<p> 1. Marketing research
2. Product
3. Packaging
4. Brand
5. Trademark
6. Label
7. Price
8. Transportation
9. Distribution
10. Sales promotion
11. Advertising
12. Retail sales and merchandising
13. Personal selling
14. Credit and its control
15. Training of sales personnel
<p>PRODUCT
<p>There are the following types of products in the market for which different fi rms look for markets:
<p> 1. Consumer durables
2. Fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs)
3. Industrial capital goods
4. Industrial raw materials and components
5. Industrial consumables
6. Service
7. Events

<p>International Marketing Management284
<p>PACKAGING
<p>An attractive package defi nitely catches the customer&rsquo;s eyes and it becomes an important factor
especially for FMCG sales. It also helps in brand and product recall, when the customer goes to the mar-
ket to make a purchase. Packaging helps in shelf displays and shops can utilise the shelf space optimally
with the right kind of packaging. It is also used in advertising of the product, thus, creating a &lsquo;top of
the mind&rsquo; recall for the product.
<p>BRAND
<p>It is the most visible form of advertising, as the product gets noticed in the shop counters, display
windows and shelves. Buyers can be prompted to buy once they have seen the product&rsquo;s brand.
An easily pronounced brand creates a positive memory of the product in the customer&rsquo;s mind. Repeat
advertising is used to strengthen the brand name. The value of the brand or its equity determines its
usage and sales. Brand names are normally chosen from the following:
<p>1. Manufacturer&rsquo;s family name.
2. Town&rsquo;s name, for example, Champagne.
3. Product use name.
4. Fancy name, which the manufacturer likes.
5. Name which is easy to pronounce.
<p>TRADEMARK
<p>Sometimes the brand name and the trademarks are the same. Trademarks are legal signs by which the
products are identifi ed. Two competing products cannot have the same trademark. Any infringement
of the trademark act can be sued in the court of law.
<p>LABEL
<p>The trademark or the brand name is usually placed on the package, which is called the label. Label
gives, besides the brand name, the product specifi cations, method of use, ingredients, expiry date,
and date and batch of manufacture. It is mandatory by the government to give some information like
the expiry date for products like food and medicines.
<p>PRICE
<p>It is perhaps the most important of the factors as it defi nes the buying decisions for most products.
Price changes bring about changes in quantity; what is sold at a higher price may limit buyers, while
a lower price encourages them to buy the product. Most products have price elasticity of sales.
However, some products do sell in certain markets irrespective of price variations, which may occur, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 285
<p>like the high value Mercedes car. While offering a price to customers, sellers give the price in one of
the following manners:
<p>1. Price includes excise duty and applicable sales tax.
2. Price excludes sales tax but includes excise duty.
3. Price excludes both sales tax and excise duty.
4. Furthermore, the applicability of price at which location, like ex-factory, FOR, FOB, C&amp;F and
<p>CIF.
<p>TRANSPORTATION
<p>Movement of goods from the manufacturing plant to the distribution system is important because the
timely availability of goods can make sales easy. A competitive situation calls for speed and economy
in the movement of goods.
<p>DISTRIBUTION
<p>Ideally, if the manufacturers can reach their customers directly without the middlemen, a lot of savings
can be made as then no middlemen commission needs to be paid. However, in reality, it is seldom
possible and that is the reason that a large range of distribution channels is required. Some of the
popular chains of distribution are given in Figure 13.1.
<p>Figure 13.1 Chains of Distribution
<p>Detailed discussion on distribution, which include having fi rm&rsquo;s own shops and franchise operations
is given in a separate chapter.
<p>SALES PROMOTION
<p>Sellers resort to promoting their products by offering incentives to the buyers, which makes the
purchase attractive. These days it is common to fi nd &lsquo;buy two and get one free&rsquo; offers. Different sellers </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management286
<p>are offering different types of incentives. These promotional offers are for both the customers as well as
dealers or retailers. As the customers including retailers are offered an instant benefi t, they are gently
forced into buying the product.
<p>ADVERTISING
<p>Sellers are also trying to get customers&rsquo; attention on the product through non-personal communica-
tion by advertising through suitable media. In the last 10 years newer media have emerged and
with computer-aided design facilities, advertising has become more forceful as well as widespread.
Advertising provides customers the right to choose a product, which best fulfi ls their needs. It is also
used to combat severe competition.
<p>RETAIL SALES AND MERCHANDISING
<p>Retail shops bring consumer products close to the customers and they fulfi l a major need. In each
shop, there are a number of products and several brands of each product. How these are displayed
and which brand gets the best place on the shelf are important areas of merchandising, which help
fi rms in increasing sales and gaining market shares.
<p>PERSONAL SELLING AND SALESMANSHIP
<p>With the best of displays and products it is not very likely that the fi rm will get the eye of the customer.
It is the persuasiveness of the seller or his salesman, which makes a difference. The salesman has to
learn to talk the language that the customer understands best. The salesman should be able to drive
home the benefi ts and the satisfaction the customer is going to derive out every rupee he is spending
in purchasing the product.
<p>Consider the following scene:
<p>At a readymade garments shop, a salesman is trying to sell a shirt to a customer and he says,
&lsquo;Sir, the shirt is made of terry silk, has good pastel shades and stud buttons&rsquo;. The statement is
a fair description of the product.
<p>Another salesman says, &lsquo;Sir, this shirt will just fl ow smoothly on your body as it is made of terry
silk, its shades go well with your complexion and the matching buttons create a distinctive look.&rsquo; This
statement catches the mind of the buyer instantly.
<p>CREDIT AND ITS CONTROL
<p>A credit buyer normally buys a little more because he is not paying for the product just then. It is
human psychology that immunes the buyer of the thought that fi nally he has to make the payment and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 287
<p>perhaps with interest. Credit can, therefore, be used judiciously as a sales tool with ample safeguards
against fraudulent buyers.
<p>TRAINING OF SALESPERSONS
<p>As new products are introduced by a fi rm, new markets emerge with increase in competition, and con-
sequently the fi rm has to innovate and bring into place new methods as well as structures and systems.
The sales people must be, therefore, continuously trained into the latest so that they always keep their
work optimised.
<p>The Concept of Buyers and Sellers
<p>From the early days of the twentieth century, the concept of sellers and buyers has undergone major
changes as discussed next (see Table 13.1):
<p>Table 13.1 Changes in Industrial Concepts
<p>Period Concept
<p>1935&ndash;55 Production
1956&ndash;65 Product
1966&ndash;91 Selling
1992&ndash;to present Marketing/customer
<p>In the stage when the prevalent concept was that of production, sellers in India believed that what-
ever was produced in large numbers and sold widely would be bought by the customers.
<p>During the product stage, the focus shifted to the quality of the products as people became more
quality conscious than before. During the period when the concept of selling held sway, competition
started raising its head and sellers had to resort to aggressive selling techniques. Advertising became
a useful tool in the game of marketing.
<p>Marketing concept focused on the customer&rsquo;s needs, combating competition through better ad-
vertising and promotion plans. From that period on, the customer became king, pursued by competitive
sellers. Business is conducted by fi rms in order to earn profi ts and for businesses to grow. This is
possible by proper selection of customer groups through market segmentation, understanding the
fi ve needs of the customers and dovetailing products to meet those needs, selection of the right dis-
tribution channel and well-directed communication to the customers through advertising. Profi ts thus
generated help the fi rms to grow further for gaining greater market share and profi ts. The decision-
making process in the customer-based concepts of marketing starts with the customers and also
concludes with business relationship with the customers. The ideal system would be when the entire
organisation, including functions other than marketing like fi nance, production, human resource
development and purchasing, all view the business from the customer&rsquo;s point of view. Only then will
the fi rm&rsquo;s customer orientation become complete. Customers have their needs, which fi rms want to
satisfy with their products. A customer&rsquo;s needs are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management288
<p>1. Known needs: These are needs clearly perceived by the customer, like the need for a house.
2. Unknown needs: These are needs that are not clearly perceived by the customer like the need
<p>for a low-cost house in the vicinity of an offi ce and school complex.
3. Unspecifi ed needs: These are needs like the need for easy power, water and phone connections
<p>in the house.
4. The need for customer&rsquo;s delight: These are needs like free membership of a nearby club with
<p>the purchase of a house.
5. The need for social approval: These are needs like the need for one&rsquo;s peer group&rsquo;s and friend&rsquo;s
<p>approval and appreciation of one&rsquo;s house.
<p>To be really effective, the marketing efforts need to have a continuous approach, as can be seen
in Figure 13.2.
<p>Figure 13.2 Continuous Marketing Process
<p>An integrated plan for marketing results in profi ts and growth for the fi rm. For other departments or
functional areas like purchase, the purchase manager should visualise the ultimate customer&rsquo;s benefi t
by purchasing the raw materials of the right specifi cations with no compromise on quality. This would
minimise the rejection at the initial inspection stage, improve productivity and reduce losses. The
human resources manager should keep the customer in mind while recruiting the marketing personnel
or even training his own team of human resources people to enable them to better understand the
needs of marketing in terms of training and motivation.
<p>PROFIT AND PROFITEERING
<p>Profi ts come from sale of a product at a price higher than the cost to manufacture it. However, if the
price is kept high, especially in monopoly markets, it is called profi teering and it is unethical and illegal
in most cases. In today&rsquo;s world, which is full of competitors, the price keeps getting depressed because
of competitive forces. A fi rm has to provide value for money and customer delight to be able to claim
a good price with reasonable profi t. It is the fi rm&rsquo;s ability to deliver the goods at a reasonable price
that ultimately benefi ts the fi rm with profi ts. However, if the customers do not derive the expected
benefi ts from the product, the sale and profi ts will be only short-lived. Competition is always around
the corner watching the fi rm&rsquo;s activities like a hawk and proactive actions for customers&rsquo; benefi ts are
required for really sustained profi tability. Price plays a signifi cant role in determining a fi rm&rsquo;s profi ts,
and yet price is most of the time linked with product quality or customer&rsquo;s perception of the product
quality. The idea of increasing sales by lowering price could become counterproductive at times.</p>
<br>

<p>Firms need to assess the needs and demands of the target market segment and provide the prod-
uct to satisfy the same with more value addition and cost-effective marketing than their competitors.
Firms must also adhere to the laws of the land about product usage safety in order to be of real value
to the customers.
<p>Firms need to optimise their plans, policies and actions in order to come out on the top and remain
there. A fi rm&rsquo;s organisational structure should be dynamic and fl exible enough to cope with envir-
onmental changes and should have the ability to fi ne-tune itself for achieving its goals. Mobilisation
of resources, timely and correct deployment of resources and process control all add up to benefi ts to
the stakeholders of the fi rms, like its buyers, suppliers, employees and the government. Doing good
to the buyers should not be at the expense of the suppliers. A fi rm should have a highly-motivated
workforce who will generate top-quality product and services for the ultimate delight of the buyers,
and be able to bring in repeat orders, better profi ts and dividends for the stockholders. It is said that
successful people do not do things right, they do the right things. Effi ciency in people can be defi ned
as doing things right and effectiveness as doing the right thing. Hence, if a fi rm is doing the right
things rightly, it is both effi cient and effective.
<p>Firms need to have core competencies in most of the functional areas of business like resource
generation, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, human resource management, product devel-
opment and government relations. The best technicians can become the best service managers with
motivation and training. With fl at organisations, multi-tasking and cross-functional teams are the
order of the day as without these the goals of the company cannot be achieved.
<p>The usual functional structures of fi rms are giving way to cross-functional structures as shown
in Figure 13.3.
<p>Figure 13.3 Functional Structures
<p>The usual functional structures of fi rms are giving way to cross-functional structures as shown

<p>As can be seen in cross-functional structures, product development involves research and devel-

management includes setting up distribution systems, sales force management and order fulfi lment </p>
<br>

<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management290
<p>relates to manufacturing, inventory management or even outsourcing the production activities. Such
cross-functional activities help in bridging the connectivity of functional areas and hence prove their
worth.
<p>A fi rm needs the following resources for its operations:
<p>1. Financial
2. Human
3. Technological
4. Infrastructural
5. Information
6. Capital/manufacturing goods
<p>With the rate of obsolescence shortening the product life cycle (PLC), it may be prudent not to
invest in capital goods and instead of buying equipment they can be leased or rented. Outsourcing of
sub-assemblies manufacture can be another option. Most shoe suppliers in the US have outsourced
their product to fi rms in the Far East.
<p>ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE
Organisational culture is one of the important areas that creates excellence in fi rms and leads to the
achievement of the goals of organisations. Organisational culture can be described as &lsquo;The way we do
things here&rsquo;. It is what an organisation will do and will not do. The culture of a corporate entity can be
felt, seen, but it is diffi cult to defi ne. There is culture of brisk polite activity, culture of sluggishness,
of customer orientation and of employee orientation. Firms with a laid-back culture fi nd it diffi cult to
shed it and become more active and dynamic. However, it is possible to change the culture of a fi rm.
It is a long process that needs patience, perseverance and continuous effort.
<p>Informal groups and teams play an important role in modifying a fi rm&rsquo;s culture. It starts with in-
fusing stories of success in the informal groups, which have an effect on these groups over a period of
time. The fi rm&rsquo;s goals and objectives, its vision and mission statements must be known, understood
and accepted by the entire team of the fi rm. All the workers and management must be committed to
them. It is the unity of purpose that helps a fi rm to become one holistic organisation and helps build
its cultural base.
<p>Congruence of culture becomes extremely essential in case of mergers and acquisitions as any major
cultural clash could jeopardise the success of the new organisation. The best of fi nancial resources,
technology and human resources cannot ensure success unless there is a cultural meeting of minds
as well.
<p>With the ever-changing environment of business, most fi rms are busy trying to dovetail their op-
erations to suit the environment. Firms that remain proactive, which have long-range policies and
plans and people committed to them are most likely to become achievers.
<p>A fi rm needs to have a customer-oriented approach to its operations. It should focus on making
and keeping its employees motivated and committed. It should have a quality plan for continuous
improvement. It should understand its responsibility towards its stockholders. The leadership of a
fi rm should have a far-sighted approach for creating a future for it.
<p>Marketing strategies of planning a proactive stance in the market come from a value system where
excellence is encouraged, despite emphasis on teamwork. Leadership qualities in a person at any </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 291
<p>level or hierarchy need to be given due recognition. The best employees are committed to customer
satisfaction and customer delight at all times.
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
<p>A fi rm that can optimise the operations of its supply chain gets an in-built competitive advantage.
The supply chain for a readymade men&rsquo;s suit manufacturer can be seen in Figure 13.5.
<p>Figure 13.5 Supply Chain Sample
<p>If the supply chain can be managed such that each buyer gets products when needed and of uni-
form quality, they can all optimise their operations. The concept of JIT can be introduced effectively
only when the entire chain is ready for it.
<p>STRUCTURAL SUPPORT TO THE CUSTOMERS
<p>In France, the telephone company gave its customers Minitel a computer terminal free of cost. Using
Minitel, customers can access, through the French telecom network a large number of services like
ordering air tickets, buying items of daily needs, purchasing cinema tickets and a whole lot more.
Such gifts make the customer loyal for a long time.
<p>INDIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT
<p>&lsquo;Our motor bike gives 20 per cent better mileage than the competitive bike. Hence if you run our bike
for 2,000 km per month, you gain up to Rs 10,000 a year.&rsquo; The salesperson should be ready with actual
calculations to prove the point. In industrial selling, that is in business-to-business sales, it is at times
easy to demonstrate the potential savings that a customer may make. The customer starts questioning
the competitors about the savings they can provide. &lsquo;Use our lubricating oils and the wear and tear
of your equipment will reduce by 10 per cent.&rsquo; Even better is saying that your maintenance time will
reduce and you will be able to produce 10 per cent more because of this factor.
<p>MARKETS&mdash;THE CUSTOMERS
<p>A number of new innovative products were introduced in the second half of the twentieth century like
television, speed cars, SST jets and in India several products got a countrywide spread like telephones, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management292
<p>railways and air travel. Therefore concept selling was a regular feature in the market place. Today, for
most products there are a number of suppliers and marketers have to be fi ghting competition. Only
for a few new products like mobile phones did the concept or the idea of using the product have to
be accepted by the target market segment and hence concept selling had to be resorted to.
<p>Sellers want to know on a continuous basis the reasons why customers buy a particular product in
comparison to another product. Buyers are looking for the following: One or more than one benefi t that
the product is offering to the buyer. How these benefi ts compare with those offered by the competing
fi rms. As against the benefi ts what does it cost to obtain the product, use it and fi nally sell it as junk?
Buyers balance the costs and benefi ts and decide to buy the product or not. Even while buying low-
cost items or making instant decisions, these activities take place, albeit quickly, in the buyer&rsquo;s mind.
A major deciding factor is product usage, which is guaranteed by the sellers through a written guarantee
as also availability of service personnel, spares at the right place and time and at the right price.
<p>Brand image plays a major role in the buying decision, besides product benefi ts in relation to its
price, the salesman&rsquo;s behaviour and thoroughness of the service needed and provided for optimising
product usage by the customer. Product price, the time and effort it takes to organise the purchase and
the customer&rsquo;s mindset are the factors that are weighed against the benefi ts the product offers.
<p>In case of industry purchase, there are other extraneous factors that decide the purchase:
<p>1. The purchase manager&rsquo;s personal likes and dislike regarding the product, brand or seller&rsquo;s
people.
<p>2. The management&rsquo;s policy of buying only the lowest-priced product (its use may turn out to be
the most expensive in the long run).
<p>3. The management&rsquo;s long-term relationship with a seller.
4. Underhand dealings between the seller and the buyer.
5. Proximity of service facility of a product.
6. Product endorsement by close friends and associates.
7. Buyer&rsquo;s innovative nature.
<p>Marketers learn fast that by providing better benefi ts and value for money to their customers, they
always win the race.
<p>CASE STUDY
ABC Cooperative Sugar Mills was coming up in western India. The order for the plant and machinery
was placed on a fi rm in Maharashtra. Tenders were fl oated for transportation of the plant and
machinery from Maharashtra to north India. The lowest tender got the order.
<p>Now imagine each piece of large equipment being hauled by two long wooden rails fi tted with
steel wheels of 6-inch diameter pulled by two oxen covering about a 1,000 km. There were at least
eight derailments and 90 per cent of the equipment reached in damaged condition. It is diffi cult to
calculate the resultant losses. Such buying decisions need careful study of the actual delivery process
and not just the one promised by the seller. Hence, the sellers must give not only value for money
but a proper usable product too.
<p>There is a saying, &lsquo;you can use the earthen pot for cooking only once&rsquo;. If the product does not
satisfy the customer, there is no repeat sale to the same customer. Besides, one dissatisfi ed customer
can infl uence potential customers into not buying the product through word-of-mouth publicity.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 293
<p>It is important to keep a track of customers&rsquo; buying patterns. There are usually three types of cus-
tomers: (a) company&rsquo;s customers, (b) competitive customers and (c) non-customers.
<p>Firms want that customers from the other two groups should shift their loyalty to them. There are
basically three methods of increasing a fi rm&rsquo;s market share:
<p>1. Take the competitor&rsquo;s customers.
2. Get new customers.
3. Convert non-loyal customers to loyal customers.
<p>Firms trying to steal customers from their competitors must be aware of the fact that their com-
petitors are trying to do the same thing. A lost buyer, one who has gone to the competitor, can provide
valuable information about the lacunae of the fi rm. He can provide information about where the
problem lies&mdash;whether it is in the product itself, whether the competition has come out with a better
product, whether it is due to the fi rm&rsquo;s terms of business like price or whether it is the fi rm&rsquo;s service.
Gaining a lost customer is a more diffi cult task than gaining a new customer. Firms need to have
senior people listening to the negative aspects of their business from these customers. Most fi rms
have a complaint cell. Some have suggestion plans also where customers can offer suggestions to
the fi rm for improving their operation. Listening to and taking care of complaints and giving serious
consideration to the customer&rsquo;s suggestions not only help in keeping the customers loyal, these are
also useful ways of augmenting customer relationship.
<p>Firms adopt customer surveys to understand customers&rsquo; attitudes towards the fi rms and their
products. Service industries like hotels, airlines and private telecom fi rms resort to these surveys.
Some fi rms have a continuous system of conducting these surveys for keeping their systems and
skills honed all the time. The surveys provide loyalty indicators for the fi rm&rsquo;s customers and fi rms
can device strategies on their basis to upgrade the same.
<p>Customer forms the market and a lost customer is market lost. If it is better technology that takes
the customer to the fi rm&rsquo;s rival then the fi rm can offer sops like discounts prior to improving and may
be bettering its own technology. If it is price or some competitor&rsquo;s promotional scheme then fi rms
must be able to react in order to regain the customer. Otherwise they can plan to hit the competitors
where it will hurt them and the fi rm will regain its market share. This is known as Cross Parry.
<p>The best approach is that of being proactive to the market needs and demands and fi rms should
be able to fulfi l these in their own innovative style before the competition tries to catch up with them.
The secret is to remain one step ahead of the competition all the time. This calls for a high degree of
management skills, a sense of urgency and proper timing.
<p>PLANNING FOR SUCCESS
<p>In the last century, success came from a fi rm&rsquo;s own plans for profi t and growth. If the fi rm was able
to declare dividends to the stockholders, it was enough. Today unless the fi rm is ready to take full
care of all its stakeholders, success may remain illusive.
<p>Stakeholders can be categorised into two types:
<p>1. Internal stakeholders&mdash;the management and the employees.
2. External stakeholders&mdash;the suppliers of the fi rm, buyers, distribution channel members,
<p>fi nancers, bankers, the government and the community.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management294
<p>While the management tends to look after itself, are they taking good care of the employees too?
Similarly, if the suppliers do not get a fair deal from the fi rm they will not be loyal and it could cause
problems for the fi rm. The buyers&rsquo; group is naturally important for the fi rm, as after the initial pur-
chase if the fi rm wants them to keep buying their products, the fi rm must build relationships with
them. Distribution channel members are, in fact, the fi rst buyers and they must be always on the right
side of the fi rm. Finance is the bloodline of any fi rm and therefore fi nancers need to be nurtured, not
just by abiding by the written agreements, but also by the fi rms behaviour pattern. Bankers provide
working capital; they should be treated as fi nancers. The government of the land feeds on the taxes the
fi rm pays. Firms must obey the laws of the land. The community provides the fi rm with employees
and as a good corporate citizen, the fi rm must look after the welfare of the community. The fi rm should
not pollute the environment by releasing noxious fumes, polluted liquids or emitting a lot of noise.
<p>In order to be competitive (by gaining competitive advantage), fi rms should optimise their cumu-
lative skills&mdash;managerial, technical and fi nancial. Gone are the days when achieving excellence in
different functional areas like marketing, fi nance, production and human resources management
fi rms could thrive in competitive markets. It is important to have multi-tasking forces, cross-functional
teams in order to not just survive, but excel in the competitive world. Stress should be on gaining
superiority over competition rather than maintaining status quo. In today&rsquo;s market you either go up
or go down. There is no place for remaining where the fi rm has been (in fact, because of competitive
forces, if a fi rm tries to increase its position, it may end up where it started).
<p>High performers work on cross-functional skills, unlike what was happening in the past when
excellence in functional areas could see fi rms reach the top. Outsourcing has become an important tool
in the manager&rsquo;s armoury. Manpower, technology, infrastructure like transportation and handling
of materials, power and market research can well be outsourced with less cost and better results.
Savings as a result of lower costs and managerial time that is freed up as a result of outsourcing can
be utilised for strategic planning.
<p>It all boils down to providing the customers value for money and mental and material satisfaction
in their buying transaction with the fi rm. And this has to be done in better ways than what the
competition is doing. Only then can fi rms gain a competitive advantage. Hence, fi rms have to start
working towards core processes rather than working on functional areas.
<p>Core processes are shown in Figure 13.6.
<p>Figure 13.6 Core Processes
<p>Suppliers Firm&rsquo;s resources&mdash;fi nance, HR, information Buyers
<p>Product development
<p>Demand management
<p>Order fulfi lment
<p>Controls
<p>As can be seen, the resources of the fi rm are outside of the fi rm. Once the fi rm decides on entering
a business, it has to acquire the same. Next, it has to identify the product it wants to market. It starts
with idea generation, study of the market (market research) and then obtaining technology by purchase, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 295
<p>reverse engineering or through research and development. Once the product has been selected it is
test marketed. It is followed by creating demand through advertisements and promotional plans,
marketing channels and retail outlets. The last step is delivery of the product against orders and getting
paid for it. The sales cycle gets completed and from this point it gets repeated for further orders. For
the system to succeed the management needs to have controls to ensure that the plans and policies
laid down by the fi rm are adhered to and it remains on track for profi t and growth. An important
aspect is retaining old customers and getting new ones. It is mainly the quality of the product and
the fi rm&rsquo;s service that are responsible for this.
<p>THE MARKET AND ITS CULTURE
<p>According to Maslow, people have some basic needs like, physiological needs like the need for safety,
sociological needs like the need for recognition and the need for self-actualisation. To satisfy these
needs people need products and in this way we are all customers at one time or the other. Our actions
are guided by, among other things, our culture. Likewise, fi rms too have their own culture and while
it can easily change its plans and policies, it is not easy to change its culture. Culture is a way of life,
shared experiences, stories, beliefs and ethical standards. In India, there is a big culture-linked market
for ethnic products and products connected to religious activities.
<p>So if people are customers and customers are markets, where do we start looking for them and
how do we retain them? The secret is to get more customers, make them happy and satisfi ed, loyal
and while doing so fi nd more customers.
<p>Firms need to select their business area, either through the geographic selection method or through
business-to-business marketing in industry clusters. Since, these contain customers and also non-
customers, market segmentation is required at this stage. Next, through advertisements and personal
contacts, the fi rm has to close on the most likely customers. Giving them product demonstrations,
presentations, supplying samples will convert them into customers. However, to retain them and
make them loyal customers, the fi rm has to supply good quality product and service. Customer
complaints, howsoever small they may be, must be looked at with a sense of urgency and the cause of
complaint removed fastest. A satisfi ed customer may help the fi rm get 10 more customers, while one
dissatisfi ed customer will defi nitely ensure the fi rm does not get 100 customers through word-of-
mouth publicity.
<p>Today, fi rms want not just to satisfy the customer, but also to delight the customer. A delighted
customer is a loyal one, usually buys the complete range of products offered by the fi rm, gives positive
word-of-mouth publicity to his friends about the products and mostly ignores competitive promotional
plans. Selling after sales, involves, periodic contacts with the customers with new developments in
product ranges, new promotional plans, reaching out with newsletters. In other words, building
relationships with the customers&mdash;relationship marketing. Even for FMCG, sellers are trying hard to
make the customer a client by offering gifts, which are found in product containers. (The client has a
one-to-one relationship with the seller, like a doctor&rsquo;s clients or a lawyer&rsquo;s clients.)
<p>Following is the list of what is sold and bought in markets:
<p>1. Products
2. Service</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management296
<p>3. Manpower
4. Technology
5. Property
6. Ideas
7. Organisations
8. Information
<p>Products can be divided into the following categories:
<p>1. Fast moving consumer goods
2. Consumer durables
3. Industrial capital goods
4. Industrial raw materials and components
5. Industrial consumables
6. Services
<p>An element of service is always included in all products. Customers have become discerning and
they demand top-quality products and its associated services. In order to upgrade this aspect of the
business, the fi rm&rsquo;s management has to adopt total quality management (TQM).
<p>In TQM, fi rms endeavour to keep upgrading the quality of their products and services continuously
in a planned manner. A fi rm&rsquo;s long-run profi tability depends on its customer&rsquo;s total satisfaction, which
in turn comes from adopting TQM. Firms get better customer satisfaction and resultant favourable
response, which improves the profi t picture for the fi rm.
<p>Let us understand what quality of a product or service is. Product quality can be defi ned as a product
meeting its specifi cations, which have been fi nalised by market research conducted to ascertain market
needs. A quality product is one, which while in use, satisfi es or delights the customer.
<p>The American Society for Quality Control defi nes quality as: the totality of features and character-
istics of a product or service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated or implied needs. Maruti and
Honda City both meet with their own respective quality standards and customers consider these
products to be of good quality. However, Mercedes, which gives a better performance than these two
brands, is known as a better or higher quality product.
<p>With training in quality management and worker empowerment, the worker in a factory and fi eld
salesmen can keep improving the quality of their product/service delivery and this is the essence
of TQM.
<p>GAINING AND RETAINING CUSTOMERS
<p>Firms that plan for short-term gain or profi t tend to lose in the long run. Careful planning and sustained
efforts to work the plans can make fi rms successful. There are four stages to the planning process:
<p>1. Environment analysis
2. Strategic planning</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 297
<p>3. Plan implementation
4. Built-in control systems
<p>Environment Analysis
<p>Firms operate in the business environment of the area/country in which they operate. The busi-
ness environment consists of the general business environment and the competitive business
environment.
<p>The general business environment factors are:
<p>1. Demographic: Factors such as population density and growth, migration from villages to towns,
income dispersion, languages spoken and the number of people who subscribe to a particular
religion form the demographic environment of the business area the fi rm wants to cater to. For
example, in India, lot of villagers keep shifting to towns. Sellers can look for opportunities that
arise out of the migration of people.
<p>2. Social environment: Social changes like the increase of women in the workforce provides a
big opportunity for sellers of home convenience products like vacuum cleaners, washing
machines, ovens, ready-to-cook foods.
<p>3. Cultural environment: India has a rich cultural heritage. Each state of the country has its own
set of festivals in addition to national festivals. Sellers fi nd the festive season in India a veritable
boon for their business as traditionally a lot of new products are purchased during festivals
like Eid and Deepavali.
<p>4. Political environment: Laws on pollution, emission norms for vehicles form part of the polit-
ical environment that infl uences businesses. Political will is required for sustaining a liberalised
economy. The government and its policies infl uence the way foreign players function in the
country. Firms need to understand the political environment to be able to take full advantage
of the same.
<p>5. Legal environment: The legal system of the country lays down the standards of business and
commerce. Consumer protection laws are meant to ensure that no seller can take any individual
for a ride, by overcharging or selling wrong products.
<p>6. Macroeconomic environment: The macroeconomic environment covers the prevailing interest
rates, balance of payment situation between countries, monetary reserves and surpluses and
exchange rates which all affect how a fi rm works.
<p>7. Global environment: The world economy and world politics are increasingly getting
intermingled as national political interests get subsumed in economic interests. With several
countries, including China, opting for an open economy, competition is forging ahead in
countries, including India.
<p>Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force Model, as discussed in Chapter 1, best describes the competitive
environment.
<p>As is well known, existing players provide the greatest challenge to a fi rm. Proactive fi rms try to
create entry barriers to dissuade new fi rms from entering the business. Patented products, unique
technology, strong hold on channel members, tight control of suppliers and product use delight of
the buyers prove to be good barriers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management298
<p>If the rail fare goes up people could fi nd it better to fl y. Firms must know the substitute products
and their marketing strategies to be always ahead of them. If there are a large number of suppliers,
then, fi rms can pick and choose and keep their bargaining power. However, when there are only a
handful of suppliers and they have many buyers, it is useful to have long-term relationships and
contracts with them.
<p>In the same way, if there are only a few buyers and the fi rm has a number of competitors, the
buyers will have the bargaining power. It is best to provide value additions and superior service to
the customers. Brand equity provides the market edge to fi rms.
<p>Let us reiterate the obvious, markets or customers are people with cash. The marketing team of
a fi rm tries to lure them into buying their products in preference to competitive ones. The products
comes from manufacturing (own or outsourced), and the raw material, manpower, technology and
information about the market are the backbone of the fi nal marketing operations.
<p>It is also true that a fi rm with no specifi c aim goes astray. Therefore the management must provide
a vision to the organisation, get it accepted by the entire workforce to make it a way of life in the
organisation.
<p>CORPORATE VISION
<p>Corporate vision is an idea, theory or commitment for doing good to known and unknown persons&mdash;
the customers. In public life and in politics too, only the visionaries have achieved great successes.
Mahatma Gandhi had a vision of an independent India, with villages as the core of developmental
activities. Pundit Nehru&rsquo;s vision was of an India with a socialistic pattern of society. In business, Rahul
Bajaj&rsquo;s vision can be described as providing a low-cost two-wheeler of international quality to the
middle and lower-middle class of the country. There is no mention of setting up of factories, marketing
and making profi t in the vision statement. Vision is inspirational in nature. It can be written down or
even be unwritten. It should be accepted by the fi rm&rsquo;s team and they should be committed to it.
<p>STRATEGIC MISSION
<p>Strategic mission of an organisation defi nes its business, gives it its character, its reason for existence,
boundaries within which it operates, what it will do and what it will not do. It also provides behaviour
norms for its members. The mission statement is the fi rm&rsquo;s image before its stakeholders. It tells what
the areas the fi rm wants to enter are and with what product ranges. It is the binding force for the
different activities of the fi rm.
<p>GOALS
<p>They are the mission statements concretised, which give a fi rm its economic and non-economic areas
of operation. They provide a fi rm&rsquo;s team with a clear guideline about actions needed to be taken.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES
<p>The objectives are the end results for which the fi rm uses its resources and skills. They are time-bound,
talk of trade-offs and serve as bases for resolving confl icts in the fi rm.
<p>A FIRM&rsquo;S BUSINESS
<p>A fi rm has to decide the range of activities in which it will operate as follow:
<p>Industries
<p>Firms have to decide which industry it wants to work in. Will the fi rm work in the area of consumer
durables, FMCG or industrial products. If it chooses to work in the fi eld of consumer durable, will
it work exclusively with cars, motorcycles or white goods like refrigerators or will it work with a
combination of consumer durables?
<p>Products
<p>A fi rm will have to decide about the range and usage category it wants to work in. For example, will
it be a single hotel or a hotel chain, a fi ve-star hotel or any other category?
<p>Skills and Competencies
<p>Companies have to decide how they will get technical know-how, whether they will purchase tech-
nology or develop it through research and development. Companies also need to decide about
assimilation of technology and technology upgrades needed for gaining and maintaining its
competitive advantage.
<p>Geographic and Income Group Market Segmentation
<p>The company needs to decide whether its products are elitists, for the common people and will
the fi rm sell only in the local market or in the entire country. It also needs to decide whether it
will go global.</p>

<p>COST CENTRE OR PROFIT CENTRE APPROACH
<p>Large businesses, which become unwieldy for management, are made into cost or profi t centres where
each centre must look after its interests as a separate unit and show its profi t. Many loss-making areas
of fi rms take a piggy ride on profi t-making areas with no justifi cation at all.
<p>From the mid-1970s, major changes started taking place in the marketing process worldwide and
its effect reached India in the 1990s.
<p>The pre-1970 process can be described as shown in Figure 13.7:
<p>Figure 13.7 Marketing Process before 1970
<p>The post-1970 process is shown in Figure 13.8:
<p>Figure 13.8 Marketing Process Post-1970
<p>It can be seen that there is greater emphasis now while planning marketing strategies on market
information, competitive actions and changes in the business environment.
<p>Plans for the marketing department of a fi rm consists of the following three areas as shown in
Figure 13.9:

<p>Market Situation Analysis
This consists of understanding the general and competitive business environment and the opportunities
and threats that the fi rm faces. Marketing research gives an idea of the business potential in the given
market segment and information about new competition. An understanding of consumer behaviour and
trends of growth or decline in the market can also be gained through a market situation analysis.
<p>Market Segment
For each product there is a market segment from which the customers are most likely to buy the
product. Market research gives a clear idea of the segment/s, which would be the most likely buyers
of the product.
<p>Product Positioning
Firms try to place the product, both physically through the right distribution channel and psychologic-
ally through advertising in the right media, for example, the upmarket Mercedes would be advertised
in magazines read by the higher echelons of the business world in order for the company to effectively
communicate with its target audience.
<p>After the analysis is complete, marketing plans are made as follows:
<p>1. Market share: A fi rm tries to achieve market shares by ensuring a proper distribution network
through its pricing and promotional plans.
<p>2. Distribution network: Firms have to decide between conventional channels like distributors,
dealers, retailers and franchisees or consider newer methods like direct marketing, telephone
marketing or television marketing.
<p>3. Pricing: Firms have to decide about whether they want penetration price, skimming price or cost
plus price and decide about channel commission and credit sales as these have to be accounted
for in the pricing formula being adopted.
<p>3. Advertising and promotion.
4. Training: of salespersons including training for the channel salespersons.
<p>Marketing plan implementation is done as follows:
<p>1. Proper allocation of resources keeping the objectives of the fi rm in mind.
2. Implementing the plan by delegation of authority and responsibility to the team members. The
<p>fi rm must plan and act for time-bound results.
3. Benchmarking and controlling the results through a feedback system.
<p>MARKETING LOGISTICS
After the goods have been manufactured they need to be placed at the most convenient locations&mdash;
retail outlets&mdash;to make buying the goods easy for the buyers. The actual transportation, storage and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management302
<p>inventory management are part of background or secondary activities. Yet, one look at them would
make you realise that these are extremely important activities. The fi rm may have the most suitable
product for the customers, but if they cannot fi nd the same easily, the value of the product diminishes
drastically. Logistics can be defi ned in this context as follows: Planning, operating and managing with
the help of modern Information System, the movement of goods from manufacturers to the buyers,
in shortest possible time and in the most economical manner.
<p>Management guru, Michael Porter has structured a method of analysing the functional areas of a
fi rm. The functions can be divided into two major blocks: (a) the staff/support functions and (b) the
line/primary functions. Figure 13.10 represents this graphically.
<p>Figure 13.10 Value Chain Analysis
<p>Support activities&mdash;HRD, Technology,
Finance, Infrastructure, MIS
<p>Suppliers Line activities-inbound logistics, operations,
marketing, service, outbound logistics
<p> Customers
<p>Inbound logistics cover the movement of materials from suppliers to the fi rm, the cost of the move-
ment and timely supplies. Operations deal with productivity as compared to competition, production
control, and automation in production and factory layout. Marketing covers market research,
advertising and promotion, distribution channels, brand equity and products place in BCG Matrix
and PLC. Service covers the guarantee service, other external guarantee services and handling of
complaints. Outbound logistics cover the movement of fi nished goods from the fi rm&rsquo;s godown to
the customer&rsquo;s place. The analyses must be done keeping the customer&rsquo;s viewpoint in mind&mdash;&lsquo;Is the
new fi nance manager having a customer-oriented approach?&rsquo;
<p>The activities of any fi rm can be divided into two groups:
<p>1. Primary activities
2. Secondary activities
<p>As can be seen, Porter&rsquo;s analysis helps in understanding the various functional areas of a fi rm.
On the left hand are the suppliers who provide the raw materials and components, which are con-
verted into fi nished products through the operations or production process. On the right-hand side
are the customers, the ultimate destination of the fi nished products of the fi rm. And the value part of
the value chain is the value that fi rms provide through the entire process to the customers.
<p>It is important to understand that unless the fi rm is adding value to the customers through the
conversion or production process, the fi rm can never sustain itself in the market.
<p>In this chapter we are dealing with mainly outbound logistics. The area of outbound logistics starts
with the distribution system of the fi rm and can be divided as follows:
<p>1. Distribution network&mdash;wholesalers and retailers
2. The customers
3. Finished goods stores
4. Demand forecasting and management
5. Inventory management
6. Final packaging</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 303
<p> 7. Order processing
8. Transportation
9. Generation of information
10. Billing (in some cases)
<p>The distribution network of any fi rm depends on the range of products, existing patterns in the
trade, customer needs as also the practicality of the network. While the distribution systems will be
discussed in detail in the subsequent chapter, the following gives an idea of the distribution channels
currently in vogue:
<p> 1. Sole distributor
2. Area distributor
3. Stockists
4. Agents and commission agents
5. Dealers
6. Franchisees
7. Own shops
8. Retailers
9. Telemarketing
10. Teleshopping
11. Internet shopping
<p>The movement of goods from the manufacturers or sellers takes place on receipt of orders from
the customers (the distribution channel members are customers for the seller). The next steps are as
follows:
<p>1. Final packing of the product, if required.
2. Arranging for the means of transport.
3. Making dispatch documents, delivery notes and packing lists.
4. Actual loading on the carrier.
5. Transit insurance, if required.
6. Inventory update.
<p>It is important to look at the customer&rsquo;s instructions carefully and adhere to them meticulously.
In case some instructions cannot be met, these must be clarifi ed and modifi ed by communicating
with the customer. Any oversight in this matter could cause major problems at the time of getting
payments from the customer.
<p>As can be seen from Table 13.2, expenses on transport are substantial when the costing of the
product is done (the fi gures are arbitrary and meant only to give an idea). Selling price of Rs 100 is
made up of the costs as shown in Table 13.2.
<p>Table 13.2 Selling Price Components
<p>Cost of money Rs 16
Raw materials Rs 24
Transportation up to the customer. It can be higher for
<p>products meant for the international market
Rs 28
<p>Manufacturing or conversion Rs 8
Overheads/profi ts Rs 24</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management304
<p>As can be seen, while most CEOs lay stress on cost reduction in manufacturing expenses, the
place where real expense takes place is transportation. For inland transport, the following modes of
transport are used:
<p>1. Railways (goods trains or passenger trains)
2. Trucks
3. Air cargo service
4. River boats
5. Ships
<p>Within town areas, small tempos, hand carts, bullock carts or cycle carts are used.
<p>EXAMPLE
<p>One fi rm making television picture tubes had to send tubes all across the country and to a few
places outside the country from a centre in west India. The normal mode of transport used was
trucks, which carried goods over large distances. Due to bad roads and bad conditions of the
trucks, inevitably 10 per cent of the cargo used to get damaged in transit. Television picture tubes
being fragile were easily damaged in transit. While insurance fi rms reimbursed the company
for the physical loss of the product, the loss caused in the production of television sets for which
these picture tubes were intended could not be compensated. International despatches were
sent by truck to the ports where the cargo was laden on to ships.
<p>The answer to reducing damage in transit was found by calling the railway authorities. They
suggested the use of their container service, which also included the provision of door-to-door
service. The containers would come to the factory on special trucks, get loaded and then they
would go on the trucks to the railway yard to get connected to a goods train meant for the
required destination. In one stroke, the problem of damages to goods was solved. Additional
benefi ts came by way of less money spent on packing as the containers were of the right size to
fi t in the required number of tubes with no extra space for the tubes to have any moving space.
Besides, it also brought in saving in transport costs and with the same money the customers
could buy more tubes. These containers were loaded on railway wagons up to the ports in case
of overseas despatches where the containers were laden on the ships.
<p>Since the movement of goods usually involves more than one organisation it calls for coordin-
ated efforts between the supplying fi rm, the receiving fi rm or individual and the carrier. The term
that encompasses the entire operation is logistics. The value of logistics can be increased by the
following:
<p>1. Integration of product movement, information system and cash fl ow.
2. Coordinated responsibility of both internal and external efforts.
3. Effi cient and effective methods of logistics.
4. Strengths and cooperation of external customers.
<p>Transportation for outbound logistics calls for the following decisions:
<p>1. Choice of transport company.
2. Selection of mode of transport.
3. Freight considerations.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 305
<p>Warehousing has the following areas of activities:
<p>1. Receiving and unloading the goods.
2. Inspection of the goods.
3. Receiving the orders.
4. Repacking, if needed.
5. Billing, if required.
6. Shipment or transportation.
7. Inventory records management.
<p>Decision-making depends on a good planned information system. The information process fl ow
is shown in Figure 13.11.
<p>Figure 13.11 Supply Chain Information Process Flow
<p>For example, look at the plight of sugar mills. The mills run usually on a seasonal basis as sugar cane
is cultivated only during a short period every year. The most important raw material in a sugar mill
is sugar cane. Each sugar mill has a limited capacity for using sugar cane. At times the sugar farmers
bring huge amounts of cane, which the mills cannot use as the space for storing cane gets fi lled up.
In order to regulate the fl ow of cane, some mills have provided farmers with walkie-talkie systems.
Using these they communicate with the farmers and tell them exactly when they should bring in the
sugar cane. This way the farmers do not have to wait for a long time in queues and the mills are also
happy that they get the cane just at the right time when they need the same.
<p>Tasks for Students
Find out a suitable system of logistics that would help the fi rm in overcoming the problem. With
computerised inventory management, faster communication systems, fi rms can ensure that their
customers have the product just when they need them, reducing their inventory and cash blocking
burden (more relevant in the case of business purchasing).
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>One important method of gaining competitive advantage is quick response, which fi rms can
provide to the market demands. It is a well known saying that it is the early bird that gets the worm.
In the same way, in the market place, fi rms that can place their products before others get the customers&rsquo;
attention and become the market leaders. With prudent decisions it can keep the leadership position
for a long time as per its plans.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management306
<p>Logistics, including transportation, can be used judiciously to provide the market with products at
the most appropriate time. The Japanese have given the world an approach to the situation known as
the just in time (JIT) approach. This adds to the competitive advantage of the fi rm.
<p>Many fi rms spend a lot of money on new product launches. These are followed by major promotional
plans. Imagine a situation when, after all the expenses have been incurred, the market is devoid of
the product. The fi rm is likely to lose a lot of money in the process.
<p>With the emergence of e-commerce, while the entire transaction may take less time, the actual
receipt of goods by the customer must be as fast as possible. In the global market place, where most
fi rms have operations in India, outsourcing of fi nished goods is becoming a common phenomenon.
It calls for a thorough knowledge of logistics, which the fi rm can plan internationally. International
shipments, air cargos, ships and, in some cases, road transport are the usual means of transport and
each one has its own set of advantages and problems. Payment terms, banking regulations, currency
fl uctuations and delivery date sanctity become important criteria for decision-making.
<p>Going back in time, till the 1960s, the business scenario in India was quite different from what
it is today. Competition was practically non-existent, there was great emphasis on government or
public sector enterprises and lots of benefi ts were given to the small-scale sector. Core products like
telecom, defence and power were meant exclusively for government agencies. In fact, it would not
be an exaggeration to say that the private sector was looked at by the government with suspicion.
Business was regulated and controlled through licenses and permits, which were doled out to the
private sector which made heavy investments with great reluctance. With little or no competition, the
fi rms entrenched in business were making money even with indifferent product quality.
<p>The supply chain of that period is shown in Figure 13.12:
<p>Figure 13.12 Supply Chain 1960 Model
<p>SUPPLY CHAIN PRODUCT PUSH
<p>Products are pushed on to the channel members to build push pressure. The fi rm&rsquo;s own fi nished goods
stores are stocked to service the market demand. In case of consumer goods, the dispatches are made
to the fi rst-line customers&mdash;the distributors. For small towns, the distributors are unable to take full
truckloads. In such situations, point to multi-point supply is made to more than one destination,
serving several distributors.
<p>A fi rm&rsquo;s fi nished storage depots have the following tasks to perform:
<p>1. Unloading goods from the trucks.
2. Stacking goods in the depot.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 307
<p>3. Inventory management.
4. Repacking or un-bulking if required.
5. Transport to the channel members.
6. Transit insurance, if required.
<p>Logistic costs vary from 7&ndash;35 per cent depending on the product and the market. Logistic movement
has a bearing on the profi tability of a fi rm as also its cash fl ow. Hence, the decision on the following
need special consideration:
<p>1. Factory site
2. Geographic markets
3. Sources of main raw materials and components
4. The location of the factory&rsquo;s own depots
5. Transport facilities, local and international
6. Inventory management
7. Packaging
8. Material handling equipment
<p>The role of the government in planning logistics is quite important due to the following reasons:
<p>1. Taxation on sales&mdash;local and central
2. Excise duty
3. Octroi and entry tax
4. VAT
5. The Motor Vehicles Act
<p>Central sales tax is charged when a sale is made from one state of the country to the other, like from
Delhi to Gujarat. Local sales tax is charged when a sale is made within a state. Excise duty is charged
on the manufacture of products. Octroi is charged when a product enters some municipal areas. VAT
is value-added tax. The Motor Vehicle Act controls the movement of trucks.
<p>International marketers must fi nd out about the taxation plans of the host country, otherwise they
might get caught in the taxation trap and may have to pay heavy penalties or face legal action by the
host-country&rsquo;s government.
<p>MARKETING ORGANISATION STRUCTURE
<p>Business in India has been undergoing changes much faster now than ever before. The business
environment, both general and competitive, is changing rapidly. Hence, an organisation structure,
which does not match up to the needs of the changes, loses its share in the market in no time. It is
therefore imperative for fi rms to keep themselves abreast of the changes to enable them to modify
themselves according to the circumstances and market situation. Flatter organisation where decision-
making is spread across the tiers is taking roots at present. In marketing, no manager can survive by
remaining away from the market place. The days of an ivory tower existence are over.
<p>In the fi rst half of the twentieth century, with no or low competition, the stress used to be on
manufacturing and sales. The idea of marketing as we understand it today was not even remotely </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management308
<p>known, at least in India. Hence, the organisational structure for selling in the 1950s was as shown in
Figure 13.13:
<p>Figure 13.13 Organisational Structure Based on Sales
<p>The sales manager with his regional managers and a team of salesmen with each regional manager
was engaged in selling the fi rm&rsquo;s products. Any market research or advertising was got done by
outside agencies.
<p>As the fi rm&rsquo;s business expanded and competition became a reality, the designation of sales manager
got converted into that of marketing manager, who assumed integrated responsibility of the different
functions of marketing. Thus, the marketing department was born with an organisational structure
as shown in Figure 13.14:
<p>Figure 13.14 International Marketing Department Based Organisational Structure
<p>Later on, product or brand managers were introduced depending on the product group and severity
of competition. Product or brand managers are responsible for the products or brands they handle.
In Hindustan Unilever, there could be a manager for soaps and shampoos, another one for cooking oils.
Or they can have a brand manager just for the Lux brand of toilet soap. The task for these managers
is to plan the total marketing strategy for their brands like the selection of the product (after market
surveys), pricing the product, organising the distribution network, planning advertising and sales
promotion for the product and related tasks of training salesmen, both the fi rm&rsquo;s and those from the
channel members, for achieving the best results. Some of their other tasks are:
<p>1. Sales forecasting, management of the market share of the fi rm.
2. Expense budgeting and control of expenses in the area in their control.
3. Obtaining feedback from distribution channel members and users about the product and starting
<p>product improvement action.
4. Continuous market watch for activities of the competition.
5. Assessment of needs for new products akin to the products being handled.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 309
<p>6. Improvement in retail trade through follow-ups, better merchandising support, including shop
layouts, window dressing, colour schemes and interior decoration.
<p>7. Proposing improvements in packaging of the product, including planning variety of sizes and
shapes of the packages.
<p>When the brand/product managers do their job well, the job of the marketing manager becomes
easy.
<p>Product/brand managers have to interact with several inside and outside agencies in order to
perform their tasks like:
<p>1. Advertising agencies.
2. Promotional agencies like public relations fi rms.
3. The packaging and purchase group of the fi rm for package purchase.
4. Sales force.
5. Market research group, within or outside the fi rm.
6. Legal cell of the fi rm for brand registration and legal action in case of brand infringements by
<p>outside parties.
7. Product development group in the fi rm to pre-empt market demand changes.
8. Finance manager of the fi rm for getting fi nancial allocations for advertising, promotion, changed
<p>packaging and training of personnel.
<p>Product management suffers from lack of coordination with other functional areas like quality man-
agement, purchasing and processing and human resource management. To enable the product
managers to function to their full capacity and utility, their role must be clearly defi ned. Any ambiguity
or transgression into other roles would cause not only hardships to the product managers but also
hinder smooth operations of the department and therefore of the fi rm.
<p>Understanding the problem areas and building a confl ict-resolving mechanism into the system can
help sort out the friction between the functional managers and product managers. Besides, the ob-
jectives laid down for the product manager should be measurable and once the managers understand
the result orientation they would themselves avoid confl icts, which in any case only impede their
work and therefore hamper results.
<p>MARKET-BASED MARKETING ORGANISATION
<p>For products that are purchased by a distinct variety of customers, the marketing organisation needs
to take into account the special requirements of the customer groups. Let us take an example. Personal
computers (PCs) are sold to the following category of customers:
<p>1. As home PCs.
2. For business and industry.
3. As part of the manufacturing process.
<p>For each category, special types of selling efforts and technical expertise are needed. The marketing
department can therefore be organised as shown in Figure 13.15:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management310
<p>Figure 13.15 Special International Marketing Department Structure
<p>CORE PROCESS-BASED ORGANISATION
<p>Functional structures have been found lacking, as they do not provide for inter-functional coordin-
ation, which results in each functional head becoming a feudal lord with little or no empathy for other
functions. Lack of coordination can be removed by two methods.
<p>Making Teams with a Member from each Area
<p>Creating teams with one member from each functional area, for example, one member from marketing,
one member from operations or production, one member from human resource management and one
member from fi nance (Figure 13.16).
<p>Figure 13.16 Cross-functional Teams
<p>Cross-functional Structure
<p>There are three areas of activity in any fi rm and the cross-functional structure takes into account the
best way of operating through these activities:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 311
<p>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
<p>Activities connected to new product idea development, manufacturing technology, purchase of
technology or indigenous development through research and development, market research to fi nd
its market, pilot production, leading up to test marketing.
<p>DEMAND MANAGEMENT
<p>Once the product has been accepted in the market, the demand for the product has to be created through
more comprehensive market research, advertising and promotion, setting up the right distribution
channels, training the sales people, both of the fi rm&rsquo;s and of the channel members, procurement of mar-
ket information from secondary sources, merchandising and publicity to enhance the brand equity
of the products.
<p>ORDER FULFILMENT
<p>These activities start once the order is received and start with materials management including in-
ventories and the latest innovation of JIT supplies from the vendors to ensure that the current assets
remain at the lowest possible levels and money is not blocked in inventories more than is really
essential; conversion of raw materials into fi nished saleable products, fi nished goods inventory and
outward logistics of dispatches to the cusomers.
<p>These cross-functional activities, along with resource management&mdash;the fi nancial, human, tech-
nology and information resources, infrastructure and fi nally the management controls, where the
activities are rated against benchmarks, complete the fi rm&rsquo;s activities in their entirety. This is shown
in Figure 13.17:
<p>Figure 13.17 Cross-functional Structure
<p>Resources: fi nance, human resources,
infrastructure, technology, information
<p>Product development
<p>Suppliers Demand management Buyers
<p>Order fulfi lment
<p>Controls: benchmarking results
<p>FLATTER ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURES
<p>The need for faster decision-making and coming closer to the customer has led to fl atter organisational
structures. The person in the fi rm who is the fi rst point of contact for the customer is one who knows
the customer and his problems the best. He should therefore be taking decisions about the customer </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management312
<p>within the guidelines of the fi rm. This has lead to CEOs having closer interactions with people at the
fi rst level of the fi rm (the company&rsquo;s fi rst point of contact) so that they can motivate them and give them
moral support when necessary. In the area of information technology (IT), most fi rms have become
popular, as there are only three tiers in a usual IT fi rm&rsquo;s hierarchy as shown in Figure 13.18:
<p>Figure 13.18 Flat Organisation Structures
<p>Other small/medium-sized organisations are considering having a fl at structure, which allows
them to make quick decisions, shortens the response time with regard to both internal and external
customers and gives them competitive advantage.
<p>NETWORKING TEAMS
<p>An extension of fl at structures is networking teams, where the functions are divided into teams,
which are homogenous in nature, work for a common goal and extend their arms to other teams for
coordination. These are inter-fi rm and intra-fi rm teams. A few examples are given in Figure 13.19:
<p>Figure 13.19 Networking Teams
<p>Marketing team can be subdivided as sales, advertising, after-sales service and marketing research
teams. The concept of networking is new in India but is likely to catch up due to its fl exibility, ease
and speed of decision-making.
<p>VIRTUAL ORGANISATIONS
<p>The concept of a virtual organisational structure is not new to India. As stated earlier, even in the
fi rst half of the twentieth century, sales departments of fi rms did not have a separate market research </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 313
<p>cell. When the need arose, outside agencies were given the task of conducting the research. Virtual
organisational structures are those which do not form the fi rm&rsquo;s own structure, but which are avail-
able to the fi rm. Many fi rms farm out selling functions by appointing a sole selling agent to look after
the same. Others farm out research. Advertising and publicity are most common areas given to outside
agencies. The virtual part of the organisation is non-existent in the organisation chart of the fi rm and
yet it exists; it performs the given tasks and takes away a lot of burden, expense and worry from the
fi rm. Some fi rms have even given the task of maintaining their accounts and fi nance including billing
and payrolls, at a nominal expense, to agencies outside their organisation. Farming out the manufacture
of sub-assemblies has reduced the manpower required to a great extent in many fi rms; all they need
to do is keep a strict vigil on the quality of sub-assemblies coming from the fi rms to which they have
outsourced. The structure would look like the one given in Figure 13.20:
<p>Figure 13.20 Virtual Organisation Structures
<p>As can be seen in Figure 13.20, the sub-assembly has been farmed out and it fi gures in the organ-
isation chart only in dotted lines.
<p>Task for Students
Please discuss if the organisational structure can have any bearing on an organisations success as a
marketing fi rm. If yes, what are the options available today for making the structures more customer-
friendly?
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>SUMMARY
<p>With the globalisation, liberalisation and privatisation of the Indian economy, a large number of
international fi rms have started their operations in India and more are likely to enter the Indian
market. Managers have to therefore upgrade their concepts and systems. Some measures that need
to be adopted are:
<p>1. Satisfying customers with a long-term commitment for the supply of good quality goods with
innovative features and life-long service support for the products with easy availability of spare
parts and service engineers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management314
<p>2. Offering a complete range of products under one brand umbrella of consistently good quality
for enhancing customer loyalty.
<p>3. Customisation of even mass-produced products to cater to discerning buyers. Maruti cars can
be purchased with the customer&rsquo;s own interior specifi cations like seats, ceiling and stereo sys-
tem. De-massifi cation of the message in advertising is meant to speak the language of a single
representative of the international market segment.
<p>4. Relationship marketing helps in keeping customers loyal for a long period of time. Newsletters,
special events and regular personal contacts help in building relationships for increased and
sustained profi ts.
<p>5. Data fi les for constant contacts at several levels. These contacts may be personal or done via
advertisements and direct mail. They are useful in combating competitive forces.
<p>6. Partnership with suppliers and dealers help in a fi rm&rsquo;s effort by keeping products of top quality
on the top of the retailer&rsquo;s displays. The greater the involvement of the fi rm&rsquo;s personnel from
each area and of every level, the better the chances of continuous improvement in sustained
growth and profi ts.
<p>7. The customer is king and any deviation from this thought process would bring only grief to
the fi rm.
<p>8. Logistics play an important role in the planning process for profi table sales.
9. Organisational structures are undergoing major changes in order to keep pace with market
<p>dynamics, as buyers have less and less time to take buying decisions.
<p>International Marketing Game 13.1
<p>1. Do you believe there is any connection between international supply chain and cash fl ow?
If yes, discuss in detail.
<p>2. Who are the internal and external customers in the supply chain? Describe their role in
creating an effi cient supply chain.
<p>It would be interesting to know the response time of the company during changes in customer
needs. As the saying goes, &lsquo;the early bird catches the worm&rsquo;, so does the marketer who can understand
the customer&rsquo;s demand or intrinsic demand (that of cellphones before they came to India and be-
fore anyone knew about them, there was an intrinsic demand which had been dormant due to lack
of knowledge of the product as also its unavailability). Customers appreciate new products if they
are useful to them in one or several of the following areas:
<p>1. Physiological needs
2. Safety
3. Social status
4. Personal esteem
5. Self-actualisation</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Concepts 315
<p>Customers are looking for customised products, faster delivery and response to changing markets
and most of all to settlement of their complaints as quickly as possible. These factors are responsible
for giving a fi rm a competitive advantage.
<p>Factors helping achieve competitive advantage from quick response are:
<p>1. Updated knowledge of the market.
2. Superior training for immediate results.
3. Faster new product development and improved manufacturing processes for cost reduction.
4. Latest technology components.
5. Ensuring no shipping delays.
6. Low down time for maintenance.
7. JIT deliveries to customers.
8. Faster movement of documents like purchase orders.
9. Well-located service centres for quick response to service needs of the customers.

Worldwide
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
To understand the international competitive environment, it is useful to use Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force
Model. In the good old days competition meant only the players in the fi eld. Today, students need
to understand the different areas of the competitive business environment that affect a company&rsquo;s
business. This chapter will help students in gaining an insight into the competitive business environment
as this knowledge is essential for gaining competitive advantage in the international market place.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 317
<p>The Five-force Model makes a comprehensive statement on what constitutes competition and is
given in Figure 14.1:
<p>Figure 14.1 Michael Porter&rsquo;s Five-force Model
<p>New entrants&rsquo; threat
<p>Supplier&rsquo;s bargaining power Present competitors Buyer&rsquo;s bargaining power
<p>Substitutes
<p>NEW ENTRANTS
New entrants pose a disguised threat as the time of their entry and the manner of their entry is not
known till the very last moment. Each country has some entry barriers and exit barriers. If the entry
barrier is high and exit barrier low then it is the best place to be, because new fi rms will not enter and
low-performing fi rms will quit instead of trying to undersell and make everyone lose profi ts. Entry
barriers can be one or more of the following:
<p>1. Government regulations like licenses required to operate in the host country.
2. High project costs, including cost of travel, transportation, import custom duties and taxation
<p>costs.
3. Diffi culty in obtaining or patenting technology.
4. Market in the maturity or decline stage in the host country.
5. Paucity of the raw materials needed in the host country.
6. Non-availability of channel members in the host country.
<p>More players in the fi eld means excess production capacity and lower profi t margins for the
players.
<p>SUBSTITUTES PRODUCTS
They need to be watched carefully as with innovation and new technology they can pose a major
threat. Home interior walls can be covered with lime wash (chuna), emulsion paints, wallpaper or
wood panels. Each has its own pricing formula and its plus and minus points.
<p>SUPPLIERS
The suppliers of a fi rm play a key role in product costs. If the buyers are few and the suppliers many,
then buyers will enjoy the power to bargain. In case there are only a handful of suppliers and several
buyers, the suppliers hold the advantage.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management318
<p>BUYERS
<p>The buyers of a fi rm&rsquo;s product are always the most important part in the game of marketing. With
large number of buyers and few suppliers, the buyers can be at the supplier&rsquo;s mercy.
<p>COMPETITORS
Competitors need to be analysed. It needs to be ascertained whether they are strong, large in number
and aggressive. If not, then the fi rm can lead the pack of competitors. How to locate competitors is a
vital question for fi rms. Pepsi knows that Coke is its biggest competitor, and yet they cannot neglect
minor competitors. In the area of television sets in India, Sony, Samsung and Philips, are the known
competitors and yet there are several small assemblers in each major centre who account for nearly
25 per cent of total sales of television sets. The same thing is true for many industries including the
computer industry. For this purpose, fi rms should arrange regular feedback from their marketing or
fi eld sales force so that the real picture of the competition, its business terms and prices can be known.
Without this kind of information, the fi rm is fi ghting a battle with ghosts.
<p>COMPETITION TYPES
<p>There are several types of competitors in the market:
<p>Monopoly
When there is only one supplier of a product in a given geographic area, the situation is called a
monopoly. In India, the government enjoys a monopoly in the fi elds of railways, power and some
defence supplies. In such cases, there is a tendency of putting skimming prices and giving less value
for money. Only when there is social commitment can price and service be in line with the rest of
the market in a monopoly situation. Internationally, host countries may have similar laws leading
to monopolies in certain products.
<p>Oligopoly
When the supplies are made by a small number of major fi rms, the situation is called an oligopoly.
Firms making core raw materials like iron, steel, oil belong to this category.
<p>Differentiated Competition
This is a phenomenon perhaps essentially of the Indian market. When an industry is divided into
large-scale organised players and small-scale assemblers and sellers of pirated goods, the competition
is called differentiated competition.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 319
<p>Fragmented Market
<p>In a fragmented market there are several suppliers of the product with similar products and hence
pure and perfect competition rules the market.
<p>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
<p>Firms get their competitive advantage from the following sources:
<p>Differentiation
<p>Differentiation can be made in either the product or any of the other marketing mix factor like price,
promotion and placement.
<p>Cost Differential
<p>With the help of economies of scale and experience curve, fi rms can achieve lower costs and strategise
their pricing to suit the market conditions for gaining market leadership.
<p>Response to Market
<p>Understanding market needs and satisfying them at the appropriate time gives fi rms an edge over
competition.
<p>Market Focus
<p>Getting into a niche market and using marketing resources like advertising, promotion and personal
selling in that market give fi rms a competitive advantage.
<p>Service
<p>While products can be copied, it is very diffi cult to copy service. Many &lsquo;me too&rsquo; products come into
the market no sooner than a successful product is launched in the market. However, it is very diffi cult
to replicate the service provided by a fi rm.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management320
<p>Vertical Integration
<p>When a fi rm takes to manufacturing upstream products like raw materials and components and also
does its own retailing in the downstream area, it gains cost-effectiveness due to better availability of
materials, low or no transaction cost, acceptable quality and better inventory management. It saves
on costs and is also able to have superior production planning.
<p>UNDERSTANDING COMPETITION
<p>Firms manufacturing the same products and targeting the same markets are fi rst-level competitors.
In order to compete, a fi rm must know its fi rst-level competitor&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, core
competencies, plans and policies and its keenness as a competitor.
<p>The competitor&rsquo;s strengths could lie in the following areas:
<p> 1. Product differentiation.
2. Prices and discounts.
3. Distribution channels.
4. Cost of capital and ability to borrow funds at low interest rates.
5. Loyal customers.
6. Purchase.
7. Manpower that is committed and loyal.
8. Research for new product technology as per market demand.
9. Government contacts.
10. High brand equity and the fi rm&rsquo;s image.
11. Resource allocation.
<p>Competitor&rsquo;s Plans
<p>To stay one step ahead, competitors keep modifying their plans, as reactions to environment changes
or as a proactive approach to anticipated competitive moves. In either case, the fi rm needs to con-
tinuously monitor its competition&rsquo;s plans and changes made by it as they keep occurring. It will give
the fi rm an insight into what the competitors are hoping to achieve by way of market share, geographic
coverage and profi ts. It will also give an idea of the cash fl ow situation of the competitors. Besides
the mindset of the competition&rsquo;s management, it is also the size of their organisation that matters.
A small manufacturer who is able to sell his product in a local area will not attempt to upset his
market by any drastic strategic changes unless he is setting up additional facilities for manufactur-
ing larger volumes. A cash-rich competitor can indulge in selling at a loss to stave off new competitors.
Usually a competitor&rsquo;s fi nancial results of the last three years can give a good indication of their
strengths and competencies. Competitors can be classifi ed as per their strengths and the mindset of
their management as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 321
<p>MARKET LEADER
<p>They have the highest share of the market. They spend a lot on retaining their position of leadership.
As the market starts declining, they try to reassess their options and strategies. They can hardly fi ght
price wars.
<p>MAJOR COMPETITOR
<p>They have a dominant share of the market. They can spend on a price war and take a leadership
position if they so desire. They are price leaders in the market. Others follow their pricing policy with
regard to an increase or decrease in prices.
<p>MINOR COMPETITOR
<p>They need additional resources and management efforts before they can take on the leadership
position.
<p>UNSATISFACTORY COMPETITOR
<p>They have major management problems and are directionless. They need a bold innovative manager
who can turn the organisation around. Such competitors should be monitored for their potential as
major threats.
<p>PROBLEM COMPETITORS
<p>They are mostly on their way out of the market and with sensible planning a fi rm can convert a
problem competitor&rsquo;s customers into its own.
<p>An assessment of competitors offers a major leverage in planning marketing strategies for the fi rm.
Firms can plan resource allocation, management stress and result benchmarking from knowledge
about the competition.
<p>The competitive cultural ethos of a fi rm plays an important role in its strategic planning with regard
to the market. The following gives an insight of different cultures prevalent in fi rms:
<p>1. Dynamic culture is one where fi rms never lose sight of their goals and objectives, are always
on the move in pursuit of these goals. They relentlessly strive to increase their market share
and brand equity. Coke and Pepsi are two such fi rms and they ensure that the other does
not get even an inch of their ground at any cost. Firms dealing with competitors who have a
dynamic culture should remain as second or third players and wait for the time in future when
the dominant player makes a mistake and slips down the ladder. Alternately, the fi rm could
bring a totally new concept product and invest heavily in marketing it to get the better of its
dynamic competitor.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management322
<p>2. A mystery competitor is one who keeps his cards close to his chest. New products, new package
are brought about to startle competition. Firms need to assess the viability of these competitive
moves before taking any competitive action.
<p>3. Follower competitor is one who tries to match others. Such competitors should never be taken
lightly as while copying they do try to improve on the original and avoid making the mistakes
the innovators have made. Patenting designs and technology could save fi rms from such loss
of business and embarrassments.
<p>Continuous Market Information
<p>Continuous market information from the fi eld force of a fi rm&rsquo;s salespersons and channel members
is the key to having an updated information bank on the competition. A fi rm&rsquo;s fi eld force should
therefore be the eyes and ears of the fi rm. The information should be analysed and competitive fi rms
categorised as weak or strong competitors. The management must use the information as a proactive
player and avoid sudden market share jerks.
<p>Customers&rsquo; assessment of competitors is the most effective way of categorising international
competition. A survey to fi nd the assessment should be done on a regular basis. A sample of information
to be acquired on a scale of 1&ndash;5 is given in Table 14.1:
<p>Table 14.1 Customer Assessment of Competitors
<p>Competitor/Attribute Product benefi ts Service rating
Channel network coverage/
<p>quality Price/value for money
<p>Competitor A
Competitor B
Competitor C
Competitor D
<p>Besides, competitors market segment, their niche markets need to be known. It will help the fi rm
in positioning its products for optimum results.
<p>IMPROVING MARKET SHARE
<p>Notwithstanding severe competition, fi rms must plan to increase their market share. Firms need to
look at the following methods for the purpose:
<p>1. Increase customer base by selling to more number of customers through market penetrating
prices. Customers can be added from new geographic areas, which have not been exploited by
the fi rm so far.
<p>2. Increase the way the products can be used. Maruti has marketed its Omni van as a multipurpose
vehicle. It can be used as a school bus, a delivery van and also a large family car.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 323
<p>3. Increase usage of the product. This can be done by telling customers to use their products more
frequently: Brush your teeth twice a day/shampoo your hair daily.
<p>In order to ensure that the competition does not take away the fi rm&rsquo;s market share it must make
its customer&rsquo;s brand loyal on a long-term basis. Relationship marketing helps in this venture when
a fi rm is not just waiting to counter the action of its competitors but is proactively interacting with
the customer to make him/her feel and believe that the fi rm is there only for him/her. When the
competition starts its campaign to capture extra market share the fi rm has to decide on the following
variables:
<p>1. Product price: Is it giving value for money as associated with the brand or does the product
price need any revision?
<p>2. Has the competition hit the fi rm in its weakest market? Is it worthwhile fi ghting competition
there or should the fi rm look for that particular competitor&rsquo;s weakest market and hit him there
(Cross Parry).
<p>3. Brand equity needs to be improved by advertising. The advertising efforts should be focused
on the target market segment.
<p>4. Sales promotion should be used to facilitate the customers to make up their minds in favour
of the fi rm&rsquo;s product and for making purchases. Countering the promotional activities of the
competition requires close watch of the market movements of goods.
<p>GENERIC PRODUCT AS COMPETITORS
<p>Other than the main competitors of the fi rm selling the same or similar products, there are other prod-
ucts too vying for the customer&rsquo;s rupee. The following examples will amplify the point:
<p>1. Motorcycles competing with cars: Both are means of transportation. With the availability of
several payment options such as leasing and deferred payments at low interest rates, it is
becoming easy for Indian customers to buy a car, although he may just be able to afford a
motorcycle.
<p>2. While goods like refrigerators compete with televisions and washing machines as also with
holiday packages such as a week&rsquo;s holiday at a hill station.
<p>3. A customer might be undecided between buying a new house, a foreign trip or a luxury car.
4. New cars compete with used cars. To cash in on this market, fi rms like Maruti have started an
<p>organisation which buys and sells used cars.
5. Firms offer low rates on exchange. If the customer returns his old product to the seller he gets
<p>a discount on the new product price.
<p>COMPETITIVE ACTION
<p>If the fi rm cannot beat the competitor, it should join in the game with similar/diverse strategies. The
ideal way, however, is to build the brand equity to such an extent that the competition cannot even </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management324
<p>come near the fi rm&rsquo;s product sales. Perhaps a change in the market segment or getting into a niche
market could be the answer. At a point when the fi rm is on a losing roll, it could plan to divest from
that product area. If the trend towards competitive upsurge is of a temporary nature, it may be a good
idea to just hang on to the product by getting into penetrating pricing.
<p>Cross Parry is another option. Here the competition is targeted in its weak area. Doing this simul-
taneously for several competitors is nerve-wrecking but an effective way of beating competition. It
creates the desired confusion among the competitors. They do not know what and who is hitting whom
and how. This requires continuous monitoring and a great degree of management commitment.
<p>CHECKLIST
<p>Firms need to monitor their competitors&rsquo; strategies and plans at the international level on a continuous
basis. For this purpose they can be guided by a checklist, which ensures that nothing is left out. The
checklist covers the essential elements of a marketing plan and uses it as a base. Firms can modify it
to meet individual requirements. Some points in the list may not be relevant to some fi rms and they
can be omitted. The numbering of points is not in any particular order and can be revised as per the
fi rm&rsquo;s convenience. The following are the uses for which the checklist can be used:
<p>1. Marketing plan: A comprehensive marketing plan can be developed by using the desired points
from the checklist.
<p>2. Information gathering during the market research phase can be simplifi ed for data collection.
Information on market forces, competition and the fi rm itself is required.
<p>3. Pre-testing and fi nal evaluation of the plan can be built into the process.
<p>MARKETING PLAN CHECKLIST
<p>Information summary for each competitive fi rm should cover information about the following:
<p>1. Its activities.
2. Its management.
3. Its performance.
4. The unique selling point of its products and service.
5. The stage of its market life cycle, that is, whether it is in the growth stage, maturity stage or in
<p>a stage of decline.
<p>Financial summary of information about competitors should include:
<p>1. The fi rm&rsquo;s capital resource.
2. Its future capital needs.
3. Its debt to equity ratio.
4. Its cash fl ow.
5. Finance deployment areas like salaries, purchasing and advertisements.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 325
<p>The summary should be easy to understand, investment friendly and exciting otherwise the
emerging marketing plan will also be drab and will not produce the desired results.
<p>Information summary of the competitors&rsquo; plan for markets should include:
<p> 1. The business in which they are involved.

2. Growth trends for the next two years.
3. Competitors and their product-wise share of the market.
4. New entrants and competitors who have just left the market.
5. Trends affecting business.
6. Economic factors.
7. Social factors.
8. Technological factors.
9. Government regulations.
10. Demographic factors.
<p>Product analysis should include:
<p>1. Description of each product in detail.
2. Product features and the customer benefi ts associated with each feature.
3. Negative elements of each product.
4. Patents covering the products and intellectual property rights.
5. Reasons for higher market shares like early entry in the market.
6. Possibility of covering the entire product range, related products, accessories.
<p>Market research analysis should include:
<p>1. Who are the major buyers?
2. Where are they located?
3. What motivates them to buy the product?
4. When do they buy it?
5. Is there seasonality in product demand?</p>

<p>MARKET SHARE AND SALES
For major customers with sizeable demand (industrial customers or distribution channel members),
the following information should be garnered:
<p>1. Type and quantities for which they can make yearly purchase commitments.
2. Last three years purchase of these customers, competitor-wise.
3. Last three year purchase from the fi rm.
4. Correlation with the following:
<p> Customers&rsquo; assessment of competition.
Customers&rsquo; product acceptance.
Production capacities and their utilisation of each competitor.
Market projections based on competitive strengths and weaknesses or on industry growth.
Effect of brand equity, assessment of goodwill of competitors as reliable suppliers of quality
<p>products, which give value for money.
<p>THE COMPLETE INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PLAN
It is presumed that with the help of marketing research and test marketing, the product has been fi nal-
ised, as also its market segment and geographic coverage. Competition has been identifi ed with its
strengths and weaknesses. Market potential has been judged and a business-monitoring organisation
has been set up for continuous feedback. In short the following have been done:
<p>1. Product fi nalised (with its detailed specifi cations).
2. Market segments identifi ed.
3. Geographic coverage fi nalised.
4. Competitive strengths and weaknesses known.
5. Feedback mechanism put into operation.
<p>The next step is to identify, in an unbiased manner, the fi rm&rsquo;s own strengths and weaknesses, by
doing a SWOT analysis. Monitoring the business environments, both general and competitive, is a
non-stop activity.
<p>Next comes the issue of product plan: Does the product need any modifi cations to cater to differ-
ent market segments? For example, the same wheat fl our could be sold in a low-cost package for one
segment and in usable packs for the other, with a price differential. Coke is another example, which
sells both in bottles and in cans. Cars can be sold with air conditioners and stereos or as no-frills cars
at a lower price. To lower the cost for repeat buyers, Bournvita, Horlicks and some cooking oils sell
in low-cost refi ll packs too.
<p>Products have been broadly categorised as:
<p>Consumer Products
<p> FMCG.
Consumer durables.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management328
<p> Industrial products:
<p> (i) Capital goods
(ii) Raw materials and components
(iii) Consumables
<p>Services
<p>The management has to decide in detail the products it wants to market. This also should answer the
question, &lsquo;What is the fi rm&rsquo;s business?&rsquo; Inaccurate judgements could lead to marketing myopia.
<p>MARKETING MYOPIA
<p>Myopia or short-sightedness in marketing comes from a narrow vision of the fi rm&rsquo;s business. Several
movie studios in Hollywood had to close down as they could not withstand the impact of television
because they felt that they are in the motion picture business. If they had rephrased their business
as that of family entertainment they would have started their own television channels. Some studios
which did that not only survived but also thrived. Firms therefore must defi ne their business clearly
taking the larger market spectrum into account.
<p>CUSTOMER TARGETS
<p>These are virtually the sales targets redefi ned to cover the market segment both on the basis of geo-
graphic and psychographic factors. The targets are then broken down sales area-wise. In practice, the
management gives the fi eld a target, which is infl ated by about 10 per cent. This is to drive or push
the team into action and with a sense of urgency.
<p>The distribution channels are the fi rst line customers for consumer products. In case of industrial
products, the actual users could be the target customers.
<p>SALES TARGET PLANNING
<p>The following need to be considered for deciding sales targets:
<p>1. Target period&mdash;yearly, six-monthly, quarterly or monthly. These can then be broken down into
smaller time dimensions.
<p>2. For FMCG fi rms, the targets are quarterly or monthly.
3. For consumer durables the targets are quarterly.
4. For industrial products, targets are quarterly or six-monthly targets.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 329
<p>5. Seasonality of sales is taken into account like warm clothes sale during winter months.
6. Historical sales during the same period of the last year or last few years.
7. Anticipated market growth.
8. Current market share of the fi rm and plans for changes in market share.
<p>With the concept of profi t centres, the targets are made for each profi t centre separately. The profi t
centre team with its leader has to accept the targets and devise plans of achieving the same. The key
to target setting is that &lsquo;Targets should be achievable but only with a big stretch of efforts.&rsquo; The fi rm
gets the best effort of the team from this approach and it puts a sense of urgency into the team effort.
On the contrary, if the targets are too high, the team starts getting disheartened and if they are too low
the team makes no or little effort and loses its enthusiasm. Team motivation and dynamism is vital
to the success of a fi rm and no management plan is complete without ways of keeping the team fully
enthused. Teams need to ensure that each member of the team fully contributes to its success and
weak links should be retrained, counselled or removed if everything else fails. Targets do take into
account changes in the business environment and the profi t plans of the fi rm.
<p>ROLLING PLAN
<p>For new products when no historical data about sales is available, fi rms have to depend on market
research information. In such cases, the sales targets need to be frequently updated in case of major
deviations from the market research projections. The best method is the rolling plan, where the plan
or target is made each month for a three-month period, which allows fi rms to make corrections con-
tinuously. On 1 January, the plan for sales is made for January, February and March. On 1 February,
the plan is made for February, March and April. The rolling plan also helps in meeting competitive
challenges as they can be changed midstream too. Since in international marketing it is more diffi cult
to predict a workable sales plan on a long-term basis, rolling plans prove to be most effective.
<p>For industrial products, purchase timetables of the industry, seasonality of demand and competi-
tive manufacture should be given due importance. Sugar mills buy most products of their use during
their cane crushing season except the products they need for maintenance during their off season.
<p>Sales target must consider the position of the product in the product life cycle (PLC) and the
fi rm&rsquo;s position, that is, whether it is a market leader or a follower. If the fi rm is a follower is it the fi rst
or second or nth follower. A fi rm&rsquo;s management has to take a decision if it wants to change its pos-
ition considering the PLC as well.
<p>PLANS AND POLICIES
<p>Once the sales targets have been fi rmed up, it is time to lay down policies, which would assist in
achieving the same. Firms must be able to realise their potential in getting a sustainable competitive
advantage (SCA).
<p>As most fi rms operate in perfect competition, it is necessary to differentiate in a manner to enable
the customers to appreciate the fi rm and its products. Firms need to appear to be different from the
competition and it can be done as follows:</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management330
<p>Product
Before the introduction of Kinetic Honda, scooters looked much the same. Kinetic arrived in the
market as a scooter that had a very distinguished look. Later, this led other scooter manufacturers to
follow suit. Dove soap, which is not a soap, is another example of product differentiation. At times
the package, trademark or logo can make a difference.
<p>Service
Service is perhaps the most important area of differentiation, as it cannot be copied by the competi-
tion. While successful products might be copied, service cannot be copied. Promptness of service
with a smile, product delivery, usage training, maintenance and availability of spares can make a fi rm
stand out from among its competitors. Ease of getting the product, speed of delivery, installation and
customer training in its usage are aspects of service, which can provide the fi rm its SCA.
<p>Distribution Channels
Geographic coverage, availability of ready stocks, merchandising and displays and innovative ways
of distribution can make the fi rm unique in the minds of the customers. Retail sales training and retail
service are two areas, which help fi rms in achieving SCA.
<p>Brand Equity
It is perhaps the most distinguishing feature of a fi rm and therefore fi rms must keep up continuous
efforts by way of advertising public relations and publicity to improve on their brand equity.
<p>Quality
Irregular quality standards and difference in batch quality can do a lot of harm to a fi rm&rsquo;s SCA. Firms
that exceed the quality norms by a good margin, gain SCA over fi rms that just meet quality standards.
They can ask for and they do get higher prices as well. Quality can be defi ned as the product meeting
with its specifi cations as given by the manufacturers. Can the quality be sustained over the period of
the product&rsquo;s life? Is it applicable quality both when the product is static as when it is in a dynamic
state? Can the product be repaired? If yes, then what are the parameters of availability of spares,
trained technicians for repair work and the like?
<p>Warranty
A fi rm&rsquo;s SCA can also come from extended warranty periods given for the products, which in turn
gets converted to peace of mind for the customer.</p>

<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 331
<p>Personnel
<p>The personnel of a fi rm, mainly personnel from the sales department as also the dealer&rsquo;s salespersons,
should be trained in providing a sustained quality of service for gaining a sustained competitive
advantage.
<p>Brand Equity
<p>It provides a built-in competitive advantage and fi rms spend a lot of time and money in trying to
built and improve their brand equity.
<p>MARKETING STRATEGY
<p>In the initial product offering, the fi rm may consider two levels of market segmentation, the fi rst one
being where heavy start up selling and advertising efforts will be concentrated. On the second level,
the buyers who follow the early birds will be targeted.
<p>The next level of strategy would be customer contact. Personal contacts in the fi eld of consumer
products are carried out through salespersons of the retailers and hence they need to be trained
in proper product selling techniques. For industrial products, the contacts could be the fi rm&rsquo;s sales-
persons or the distributor&rsquo;s salespersons, depending on the type of products being sold.
<p>Products should be differentiated in accordance with their unique selling proposition (USP), be it
product quality, price delivery warranty or service which goes with the product.
<p>For products that have seasonality in their sales like warm clothes or air conditioners, the fi rm&rsquo;s
marketing strategy should involve plans for out of season sales.
<p>Price should be planned with careful consideration of the PLC, competitor&rsquo;s pricing and the
fi rm&rsquo;s marketing objectives. For increasing market share, penetrating price could be kept while for
increasing profi ts skimming prices could be considered. The following need careful consideration:
<p>1. Is the fi rm&rsquo;s price lower than its competitors? Is the fi rm losing profi ts for no reason?
2. Is the pricing strategy carefully thought out?
3. Do the prices cover both goods and services?
4. Will the pricing strategy secure and increase product acceptance in the desired market
<p>segment?
5. Should the fi rm maintain or increase its market share as per it marketing objectives?
6. Does it provide profi ts?
7. Can a higher price than the competition be attributed to a product&rsquo;s innovative nature, quality,
<p>warranty or service?
<p>The increase or decrease of price infl uences profi tability as a result of the effect on sales. However,
the effect of price on sales is not always obvious. For example, price decrease often results in increase in
profi ts. A good example is the decrease in long-distance telephone rates, which have resulted in greater </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management332
<p>usage and a consequential increase in profi ts for telecom companies. Government regulations and
changes in taxation rates are also responsible for changes in prices but as these affect the competitors
also, their impact can be on changes in the total demand pattern but not on individual fi rms, unless
some fi rm loses the opportunity of price changes to win customer goodwill.
<p>A decrease in the price of its product by a fi rm will be normally be matched by its competitors
nullifying any advantage to the fi rm especially in the long run. It may result in price wars, which are
detrimental to all the competitive fi rms. However, price collaboration or cartel formation is illegal
in India and in most other countries.
<p>The prices of products offered through the distribution channels can be subject to modifi cations
by the channel members with or without the knowledge or approval of the fi rm. This helps the
channel members in increasing their profi tability. It, however, may result in damage to a fi rm&rsquo;s fair
name and brand equity.
<p>PRICE&ndash;QUALITY STRATEGY
<p>The price and quality of a product do get associated with each other as shown in Table 14.2:
<p>Table 14.2 Product Price Parity
<p>High price Medium price Low price
<p>High quality Premium goods Loyal customers Intensive growth
Medium quality Overpriced product Middle of the market Bargain goods
Low quality Fast profi t Shoddy goods Discount goods
<p>Consideration of the phase of the PLC of the product must be made. In the growth stage, volumes
of business and competitive action should be taken into account. High or skimming prices can give
short-term gains and low prices can lead to change in the customer&rsquo;s mind about the quality of
the product.
<p>SELLING STRATEGY
<p>It is a vital task of the marketing department of a fi rm to plan out strategy for selling the products.
A fi rm&rsquo;s salespersons, its distribution channels and their sales force are to be considered for the
plan. Additions to the sales staff, channel network and areas of coverage need to be considered.
The selection procedure for the additional staff, distribution channel members, their remunerations,
salaries, commissions, discounts and margin share-out between the different channel members like
retailers and distributors should be fi nalised. Turnover discounts and cash sale discounts need spe-
cial consideration.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Market Competitive Forces Worldwide 333
<p>The fi rm&rsquo;s service and warranty policy need careful planning. Depending on products these could
be either vital or inconsequential for purchase decisions. In consumer durable products, capital goods
service and warranty play a major role in purchase decisions. (Maruti cars claim to have the widest
service network in the country and this claim has become the fi rm&rsquo;s USP.)
<p>Handling of complaints needs special consideration as even in the best-quality products, problems
can arise. It is the promptness, courtesy and expertise with which the complaint is handled that makes
the difference in repurchase decisions or in dropping the vendor altogether.
<p>Even for the top-quality product, communication with the customer is vital. Plans for this are
made as follows:
<p>1. Advertising plans including creativity, market segmentation, media and timing of the
campaign.
<p>2. Sales promotion is done to counter customer resistance for the purchase of the product of-
fered by the fi rm. Planning sales promotion is done by taking into account the market share
objectives of the fi rm, PLC and it can be done both for the channel members as also for the
customers.
<p>3. Publicity is organised as a vital communication link where the customers get the product
information through editorial or expert comments, as it is not paid for by the fi rm and so is an
unbiased opinion. The sponsors do not have control over the message.
<p>4. Advertising includes all paid non-personal messages to the consumers. The selection of media,
budget, timing and contents of the messages are signifi cant and important areas for the fi rm.
<p>5. Sales promotion includes coupons, contests, money-back guarantees, free samples, gift items.
It plays a major role in the purchase decisions of the buyers. With severity of competition
increasing, sales promotion has become a way of life for most fi rms.
<p>International Marketing Game 14.1
<p>The team should analyse the importance given by the fi rm under study to customer service for
gaining sustainable competitive advantage.
<p>The fi rst three methods, differentiation, cost leadership and quick response, do provide com-
petitive advantage to the fi rm, but these could be temporary, as the competition knocks off the
advantage usually with a fl air by not only copying the differentiation, but doing one better than
the fi rm as they have seen the customers&rsquo; reactions on the differentiated product or the other Ps.
Service is one element of the product, which is less likely to be copied. It is not possible to copy the
genuine smile of a salesman, his ways of ingratiating himself with the customer, his relationship-
building techniques, which although they can be taught, remain in the realm of soft factors that
cannot be easily quantifi ed much less copied. Service therefore is one of the ways of creating and
maintaining sustainable competitive advantage.</p>

<p>15 Advertising and Promotion in
International Markets
<p>A I M S A N D O U T C O M E S O F T H E C H A P T E R
International advertising needs special focus on local issues of the host country and with huge moneys
involved students must become fully aware of the fi ner points of international advertising and pro-
motion to make each campaign count. For creating an effective advertising campaign, the advertiser
needs to have the answers to the questions who wants the product, for whom is the advertising campaign
created and how? These and several such questions will be answered in this chapter. Students will
learn how the advertiser can hit the bull&rsquo;s eye of international consumer psyche every time!</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management336
<p>Advertising often grips people&rsquo;s minds, their psyche, in such a way that a make-belief world,
a virtual world, gets created. So, what exactly is advertising? Who wants it, for whom is it
created and how? We will answer these and several such questions in this and the following
<p>chapters. We will also discuss how the advertiser can hit the bull&rsquo;s eye of the consumer&rsquo;s psyche
every time!
<p>Advertising management today has become an important area of business and that is why even
the common man is quite aware of the subject. However, for a professional it is essential that not
only the subject is learnt thoroughly but even subtle nuances are understood so that the person becomes
comfortable with it. With practice expertise can be gained to strengthen the skills. Advertising is a fast
moving, glamorous discipline and yet without proper concepts it can become quite banal.
<p>ADVERTISING DEFINED
<p>Texts on advertising have given a few defi nitions of advertising. With the thrust of media variants,
that is, several new media being available, the defi nition can now be modifi ed. First we take the most
popular defi nition, that of the American Marketing Association (AMA), which defi nes advertising
as, &lsquo;Any paid form of non-personal presentation and promotion of ideas, goods and services of an
identifi ed sponsor.&rsquo; The communication is non-personal, as nobody has personally conveyed it. What
we witness in retail shops when the salesman talks to us to sell a product is that he is personally
communicating with us and hence by the defi nition of the AMA it is not advertising.
<p>The presentation is meant for promoting the ideas, goods and services to create awareness and
assist in selling the product. A person or fi rm known to the company does the advertising. This be-
comes essential to avoid wrong messages being advertised, or sometimes the message becoming
useless, as the potential buyer would not know whom to approach for buying the product, idea or
service advertised if the advertiser is unknown.
<p>Advertising can be considered as the soul of marketing in today&rsquo;s world of complex and
severe competition. Or it can be a substitute elder brother who helps in taking purchase decisions.
Advertisement for the target audience: It is important that the people who are the likely buyers see
the advertisement message. Hence, advertisers cater to different market segments with the help of
separate media as also target-specifi c messages. Advertisements for a Toyota car would not have
any takers in a slum cluster; advertisement for low-cost clothing material would be of no use to the
wealthy elite.
<p>Consumer advertising deals with the actual buyers and users of the market segment and therefore
uses a language and a medium best suited to the target segment. Business advertising converging
on the target segment has to be in magazines seen by the purchase and technical persons of fi rms.
For instance, an advertisement for television (TV) picture tubes would be best seen in trade magazines
that cater to the TV manufacturing industry.
<p>The geographic area of coverage of the media assists in focusing on the target segment where the
fi rm believes there is maximum business potential. A fi rm wanting to distribute its products on an
all-India basis would have to look at the national press, magazines with a national circulation and
readership and national TV, including satellite and cable TV channels.
<p>Similarly, fi rms that want to do business internationally need to select the right media like satellite
TV, internet or the national press of the countries where the fi rms want to do business. Hence, it can
be surmised that advertising plays multi-faceted roles in business. Not only does it inform the target </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 337
<p>segment about the product or service offered by the advertiser but also persuades them to buy these.
Since the communication is non-personal, the one drawback is that no immediate and direct reaction
or response is available to the sponsor of the advertisement.
<p>PERSONAL SELLING
<p>In case of consumer goods, personal selling effort required is 20 per cent and advertising backup sup-
port required is 80 per cent. In the case of industrial products, personal selling required is 80 per cent
and advertising support required is 20 per cent (see Table 15.1).
<p>Table 15.1 Personal Selling Effort and Advertising

Industrial products 80 20
<p>TASKS FOR ADVERTISING IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
<p>Let us discuss the tasks before advertising in the twenty-fi rst century. In case of new innovative prod-
ucts, the target segment may not even be aware of the product hence and the fi rst task of advertising
is to bring about product awareness in the target segment. The steps that need to be taken are:
<p>1. From unawareness to awareness.
2. From awareness to knowledge about the existence of the product in the market.
3. From knowledge to desire of possession of the product.
4. From desire for the product to conviction about its utility value and related benefi ts.
5. From conviction about the product&rsquo;s utility to brand preference.
6. From brand preference to purchase action.
7. From purchase of the product to its continuous evaluation.
8. From continuous evaluation to repeat purchase decisions.
<p>Imagine the time when cellphones had not invaded our country. The marketers had to resort to
teaser advertisements to arouse curiosity in target segment, which created awareness and as the
product was launched fi rms got good response. It is worthwhile to mention that a bad product cannot
be sold and as a corollary should not be advertised.
<p>ADVERTISING MIX FACTORS
<p>Advertising is one of the marketing mix factors. Let us analyse the advertising mix factors. In totality
there are six sides to advertising. They are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management338
<p>1. Advertiser
2. Advertising agency
3. Media
4. Public relation consultants
5. Ancillary services
6. Freelance services
<p>Advertisers can be categorised as profi t making organisations and non-profi t making organisa-
tions. The fi rst category consists of the government and government bodies including public sector
companies. The government advertises for purchasing through tenders, selling surpluses and
recruitment through public service commissions.
<p>Manufacturers advertise when they want to sell (for example, power and industrial raw materials)
directly to consumers. They advertise to buy from the market what raw materials components they
need to manufacture their fi nished products.
<p>1. Service providers like travel agents, hotels and airlines advertise to sell their services.
2. Importers advertise to sell their goods to the target segment.
3. Distributors, retailers and other members of distribution channels advertise to sell their products.
<p>Since their area of operation is limited, their advertising is also confi ned to the geographic area
they serve.
<p>4. Mail order suppliers advertise so that their catalogues are purchased by their target segment,
which could result in their getting orders by mail. Burlington&rsquo;s and Reader&rsquo;s Digest are examples
of mail order suppliers.
<p>The second category of advertisers are non-governmental organisations, like family planning
groups, destitute children help groups, de-addiction centres.
<p>ADVERTISING AGENCY
<p>The main role played by advertising agencies is that of communication experts, who assist the ad-
vertisers in obtaining optimised benefi t for the money they spend in advertising by ensuring that the
target segment gets at least an opportunity to see (OTS) the product advertisement. The advertise-
ments are given in properly selected media, which result in improved brand awareness and
consequently improved sales and profi ts which is the major tasks of advertising.
<p>There are several types of advertising agencies operating in the market place to suit different
needs of advertisers. Many times one advertiser uses one agency for one type of advertisement and
a separate one for meeting other needs. The main types of agencies are:
<p>1. Large, full-function agencies
2. Medium-size, full-function agencies
3. Specialised technical agencies
4. Hot shops
5. Agency of records</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 339
<p>Large, full-function agencies comprises the following departments:
<p>1. Account servicing department
2. Account planning department
3. Creative&mdash;art, copy, visualiser
4. Media planning department
5. Electronic media coordinator
6. Research department
7. Budgeting and billing department
<p>In India, JWT and Lintas are two of the most famous advertising agencies.
Medium-sized, full-function agencies may not have research and account planning departments.
<p>Otherwise, they are similar to large agencies and they graduate to large agencies as their billing and
business increases.
<p>Specialised technical agencies are agencies working for a niche market, that is, fi nancial fi rms,
information technology companies and television companies. They normally keep experts in their
area of specialisation either on their rolls or on a consultants&rsquo; panel.
<p>Hot shops are small, lean agencies, which operate on low overheads and do quality work by hiring
experts on a project basis.
<p>Agency of records (AOR) is an agency with a large business portfolio and surplus resources. Such
agencies buy popular media space in bulk, use it at advantageous costs and sell it to smaller agencies in
times of need. For their investment they take a 2 per cent profi t margin from the smaller agencies.
<p>THE MEDIA
<p>From the early days of hand-painted posters, media has come with a long way what with the cable
and satellite television revolution. Joining the bandwagon is the internet and computer designing of
advertisements.
<p>Broadly media are characterised as follows:
<p>1. Press
2. Electronic
3. Computer, Internet
4. Outdoor
5. Point of purchase
6. Direct mail
7. Miscellaneous
<p>Press relates to newspapers in English, Hindi and the regional languages, magazines, in different
languages, targeting various segments&mdash;cultural, religious, sports, fashion, fi lms, wildlife&mdash;the list is
a long one. The advertiser has to look for the right paper or magazines which are read by the target
segment to ensure OTS. Many top executives have virtually no time to watch television and hence
they get the news and other information from newspapers and business magazines. Marketers of
products meant for this market segment should therefore use newspapers and magazines to reach </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management340
<p>the target segment effectively. Expensive cars, laptop computers and expensive dress materials could
fall in this category.
<p>Electronic media relates to television, radio and videocassettes. Television as a media for advertis-
ing has made the biggest impact on almost all the segments of customers. Satellite and cable TV have
invaded practically all homes. Viewership of TV has increased manifold and terms like couch potato
have been invented for people who are constantly viewing TV. This fact has opened up advertising
vistas for a majority of the products. The advertiser has only to understand the programme one seg-
ment views and then he can plan to place his advertisement during that particular programme.
Similarly, FM channels of the radio have become popular in metro towns and enjoy a large teenage
following. Products meant for teens can be advertised on FM radio with great certainty of success.
Telemarketing and teleshopping are making strides as the latest media. Products are sold through
telephones in one case while in the other TV is used for demonstrating the working of the product
and for soliciting orders.
<p>Computers and the internet are relatively new in India but they are making giant strides in the
advertising and marketing world. Hence, in the present day context, it is important to understand
these media in order to succeed. With on line e-commerce, banking and purchasing it is expected that
people with buying power will be more hooked to computers than ever before. It is important to note
that information technology is the future of communications with computers and telecommunications
joining hands to provide the safest, fastest and most economical means of reliable communication.
Advertisers need to understand the medium and take full advantage of the same.
<p>Outdoors relates to hoarding, billboards, neon signs, bus panels, kiosks, balloons and the like.
Advertisers use these as reminder advertisements as well as product launch advertisements too.
<p>Several marketers resort to sending technical literature by post to prospective customers, like
Readers Digest and Burlington. This is referred to as direct mail advertising. Point of purchase advertising
has been updated with technological advances. Retail shops were content earlier with posters, danglers
and innovative packaging of products. Today, largely due to advances in multimedia, interactive
screens are used for advertising products. Here customers can get any information about the shop
including availability of product, stocks and prices. Many shops run continuous programmes on these
interactive screens with animation and product advertisements in order to attract the customer.
<p>Teleshopping is becoming popular but gradually, as the Indian shopper wants to see and feel the
product before buying it. Additionally, shopping expeditions are often fun time outings for families
and it would be diffi cult to replace that experience with teleshopping.
<p>Telemarketing uses the telephone as a means to communicate with a prospective customer about
the services the marketer is providing and is at times a good approach to elicit the right response
from the customer.
<p>Coming to miscellaneous advertising media, we have all seen big balloons in the sky carrying
advertising messages, advertisements on bus panels, in the yellow pages, directories, rail and air
tickets and even on matchboxes. We have also witnessed advertisements on camels and elephants
especially designed for village fairs. Human with unbounded human imagination, newer advertising
media can be found or invented.
<p>India has witnessed a lowering of prices of newspapers from Rs 4 to Rs 1.5. This drastic reduction
has been possible because of heavy advertising revenue that newspapers get. In order to get a good
share of advertising, the press depends on its circulation fi gures. The higher the circulation, the greater
the advertising revenue. And yet, in view of heavy competition newspapers face, they resort to selling
and advertising their space too. Let us see how it is done:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 341
<p>1. Rate cards are mailed or given to advertising agencies and advertisers to make them aware of
the advertising costs for advertising in the newspaper.
<p>2. Direct mail with copies of successful campaigns and promotional folders.
3. Maps of geographic areas covered by the newspaper with its demographic details.
4. Availability of research material.
5. Copies of special numbers and advance programme of special issues.
6. For TV channels, information about programmes of interest, like fi lms, chat shows, are
<p>provided.
7. For outdoor advertising, the availability of hoarding positions and information about the
<p>number of vehicles passing that hoarding is provided.
<p>PUBLIC RELATIONS CONSULTANTS
<p>As we compare advertising with a newspaper&rsquo;s coverage, it becomes clear that editorial coverage
invariably gives better credence to advertisement, since it appears as the unbiased opinion of a third
party, that is, the newspaper editor. Advertisers always seek to boost their image and they look out
for public relation (PR) consultants who have good contacts with the press. With the help of these
PR experts, the companies get articles about the fi rm and its products printed in the press. This makes
an invaluable and signifi cant contribution towards the image building of the fi rm as customers give
greater credence to unbiased opinions about a product/fi rm (as expressed through newspaper articles)
than they give to advertising.
<p>Public relations as a function helps fi rms evaluate their standing, brand image and credibility in the
market place. Since brand building and brand equity come through advertising and PR, it becomes
imperative to integrate them at a certain level.
<p>ANCILLARY SERVICES
<p>Advertising agencies have to take the help of several ancillary service providers, as it would be too
expensive to have all the services under one roof. Major services, which are hired by agencies, are
as follows:
<p>1. Independent producers for making short advertisements for TV or cinema. Even large ad-
vertising agencies do not have a fi lm-making division. They all hire independent specialist
producers on contract. These producers are then briefed by the agency about their client&rsquo;s
requirements. From this stage on, from the selection of the fi lm script to selection of location,
selection of models and cameraman and other issues related to fi lm-making are arranged by
the producer in consultation with the agency and the advertiser.
<p>2. Manufacturers of point of purchase advertising material like posters and danglers.
3. Direct mail houses who take upon themselves the tasks of arranging to have an address databank
<p>and the advertising material to be sent along with its frequency of dispatch.
4. Manufacturers of containers, packing material and cartons who provide the advertiser with
<p>packages, which become part of advertisement.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management342
<p> 5. Printing presses, litho press and typesetters, who are required for print media advertisements.
6. Electrical and electronic panel makers.
7. Manufacturers of working models.
8. Gift suppliers.
9. Audio-visual equipment suppliers.
10. Merchandisers.
11. Desk-top publishers.
<p>Freelance service providers like copywriters, artists and visualisers, are hired for specifi c jobs by
small agencies like hot shops and at times by small advertisers themselves, who cannot afford to hire
an agency.
<p>The challenge of creating a powerful advertisement, which can change the mindset of the target
segment, has assumed great importance in the twenty-fi rst century. With advancements in the tech-
nology of communication as also in product groups and constant upgradations, more and more money
is going to be spent in the years to come on advertising. As marketers and advertisers, fi rms should
be ready with the necessary tools of the job.
<p>Advertising is, as understood now, is part of the marketing game. To better plan advertising, fi rms
will have to reinforce their marketing plans. Selection of markets for the product, distribution net-
work, pricing and the timing of its launch would affect and determine the type of advertisement
campaign that should be created and what would be the best media for the same. Therefore it is from
marketing plans and budgets that advertising plans and budgets would evolve (see Figure 15.1).
<p>Advertising is therefore part of business strategy as can be seen from Figure 15.1.

<p>Sales as Objective
<p>Business today aims at continuous improvement in the bottom line. Profi t remains the prime motive
and to achieve a reasonable return on investment fi rms have to struggle as competitors are equally
focused on the same subject. Advertising is a distinct aid to improving sales. Many advertising agencies
refute that advertising should directly increase sales. However, the ultimate use of advertising must
be to improve profi table sales.</p>

<p>Communication
<p>Advertising is used as a means of communication as marketers want to provide information about their
products to the target segment. Marketers also inform about new products in the pipeline, discount
offers, new retail outlets and of late exchange offers.
<p>1. Awareness: The fi rst step in business communication through advertising is of creating
awareness. For product launches it becomes critical that the target segment gets to know about
the product.
<p>2. Comprehension: Advertisement should result in the potential customer getting to know about
the features of the product.
<p>3. Acceptance: The third step is the acceptance of the product as a means of satisfying customers
needs, whether they buy it or not.
<p>4. Belief: Advertisements must give rise to the belief that the advertised product is the one that
the customer needs.
<p>5. Purchase action: Purchase action is the next step, as the customer has fully understood the value
he/she will derive from the product.
<p>6. Usage and repeat buy: Usage and repeat buys results from satisfaction of the customer. Products
that do not just satisfy the customer but also delight him are likely to have usage and repeat buys.
<p>Thus the chain goes on, which starts with a customer&rsquo;s awareness of the product.
<p>Price Changes
<p>Product prices convey to the buyers a lot more than just what they are paying for. Price denotes quality
of the product besides authenticity of supply. For industrial products, price could include packing,
taxes, duties and transport/insurance costs. Unless marketers make a clean statement of the prices
there can be lot of room for cheating the customers. Hence, good marketers invariably announce price
changes through advertisements in the media right for the target segment.
<p>Prompt Direct Action
<p>Buy today and get a 20 per cent discount, the offer ends in just two days&mdash;are some of the gimmicks
used to prompt the customer into action. These offers must be advertised for letting the target segment
know about the offer and to take advantage of it.
<p>Encourage Customers to Ask for Information
<p>Customers are encouraged to seek more information through teaser advertisement. When Bharti Telecom
introduced Airtel, their cellular phone service, in Delhi, the city roads were decorated with banners with
the message: &lsquo;There is something new in the air&mdash;Airtel&rsquo;. Several industrial product advertisements </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 345
<p>give only basic specifi cations to generate curiosity and interest which prompts customer to ask for
specifi cation details.
<p>Message about the Needs the Product Meets
and it&rsquo;s Satisfaction
<p>Message of the need of the product and its satisfaction has become one of the most common objectives
of advertising. In the summer months the emphasis is on thirst and how cold drinks help to quench
one&rsquo;s thirst. The cola companies are known to spend millions of rupees on advertisements. Advertise-
ments on college billboards for books pinpoints the need for books and how this can be fulfi lled.
<p>Product Success Stories
<p>Product success stories are advertised to reinforce the customer&rsquo;s commitment of purchasing the prod-
uct. Hero Honda have been advertising the fact that their scooter is the only one to have climbed the
high mountain pass of Khardungla, confi rming the high quality of the product, which in turn would
make the customers delighted and prospective buyers would strongly consider purchasing the scooter.
Customer&rsquo;s brand loyalty can not be taken for granted by any marketer. Such stories could improve
the chances of having brand loyal customers.
<p>Benefi t Story
<p>Benefi t story is usually the fundamental theme of most advertisements. It could be the promise of
fairer skin (skin whitening creams), better health (tonics), better mileage (fuel-effi cient cars) the list
is endless. Researchers say that people do not buy products; they buy the satisfaction or delight they are
likely to obtain from the product. A car is not just a car; it is a comfortable means of transportation.
The benefi t story for the Maruti Esteem brand of car is given in Table 15.2.
<p>The benefi t story can be made for any product as it sifts the features from the benefi ts, which can
be gained from a product. These benefi ts ultimately converge on the basic needs of people as per
Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs (see Table 15.2).
<p>Table 15.2 The Benefi t Story Relating to Maruti Esteem Car
<p>Car features Benefi ts from the feature
<p>Sleek sedan model Projecting high lifestyle
Comfortable seats, leg room Physical comfort
Big luggage boot Family car
High power engine High lifestyle/youth
Power windows Comfort
Countrywide service Peace of mind</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management346
<p>One advertisement of the Maruti Esteem featured a husband driving in his Esteem with his wife
and a child. He stops the car to buy something and the child brings out the cake from the dickey.
The wife puts on &lsquo;the happy birthday&rsquo; song on the tape player and they surprise the husband on his
return when he hears the song and sees the cake. Then the family drives away towards the horizon.
The advertisement tries to show that the Esteem is a luxury family car.
<p>Attitude Change
<p>When the marketer fi nds that the competitor is fi rmly entrenched in the target segment, the advertis-
ing becomes more aggressive, as it is necessary to have a change of attitude in the customer group.
A lot of comparative advertisements are used for this purpose. The customers are informed in great
detail about the shortcomings of the competitive products as compared to their products. However,
this approach is wrought with diffi culties, as it may not be possible to prove the point and then the
competitor can go to the court of law and claim heavy damages.
<p>Advertisements of Colgate toothpaste were too far-fetched as the claims made by them were not
easy to prove and hence they had to revise the advertisements.
<p>Reassurance
<p>Reassurance becomes imperative for marketers to keep their customers on their side as competition
is always trying to get them to their side. Reassuring advertisements that keep confi rming the quality
of the product, its availability at a reasonable price and in products with long life cycles are a must
to keep the sales going.
<p>Product Launches
<p>Everyday a new product is introduced in the market&mdash;sometimes with great fanfare and sometimes
tamely. Medimix soap was introduced with minimum advertising. It was only when its sales picked
up that the makers started a big advertising campaign, which the company hoped would raise the
awareness level about the product and hopefully would increase its market share. Whirlpool started
sales of their washing machines with much advertising and is reaping the bounty of a good share of
the market.
<p>Product launch provides the biggest challenge to both the advertiser and the advertising agency,
since the success of the product depends greatly on its launch.
<p>It is important to learn about product life cycle (PLC) at this stage. Each product goes through its
life cycle, which starts with its introduction, then comes growth followed by maturity and fi nally it
terminates in the decline stage.
<p>1. Introduction stage: When a new product is introduced in the market, as cellphones were, in
the beginning the fi rst buyers purchase it. These people are society leaders, innovators and </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 347
<p>experimenters. Naturally, they have the fi nancial power to back their purchases. Since the
number of such buyers is small the sales graph moves slowly during this stage.
<p>2. Growth stage: After the fi rst buyers (early birds), the fi rst followers buy the product, who wait
to see the utility of the product through the experience of the early birds. Since this category of
buyers is larger than the fi rst one, the sales jump up and marketers must provide for increased
supplies of the product in the market. (It can be assumed that in India most products are in the
growth stage as product demand keeps increasing as, due to the country&rsquo;s economic policies,
each year a small percentage of the lower-income group gets into the next higher income group
and acquires better purchasing power.)
<p>Figure 15.2 The Income Triangle
<p>In Figure 15.2, the top-most part is of the elitist group with a small percentage of population in it,
say 0.5 per cent. The second level is bigger than the fi rst and has a population of say 5 per cent. The
third level could have a population of about 15 per cent, while the fourth 20 per cent. The lower in-
come group could be about 25 per cent and the lower lower income group could comprise 30 per
cent of the population. Hence, any shift of even 1 per cent of the lower- lower-to-lower and lower to
middle income group could change the demographic pattern considerably.
<p>In the introduction stage of the PLC, the product needs major advertising efforts for product
launch, which could include concept selling, product introduction, price and distribution network
announcements for the target segment customers.
<p>In the growth stage, the early marketers have the initial advantage. They can not relax because
competition with &lsquo;me too&rsquo; or even better products comes into the market.
<p>In the maturity stage, as the market gets stagnant, sales is almost static, only replacement purchases
take place. In such situations, fi rms have to plan their strategies. They have to decide whether they
want to stay in the market with heavy advertisement or divest and quit.
<p>In the decline stage of the PLC, with severe competition many fi rms do quit, as can be seen in the
video cassette recorder market. If the fi rm decides to stay, it will have to create new market uses for
the product.
<p>Product modifi cations call for informing the prospective customers about what is new and what
it would do for the customer or what extra benefi ts are available in the new product. The computer
and IT industry is the most innovative one where everyday something new happens and marketers
want to be the fi rst one&rsquo;s to introduce the product. The PLC of such constantly developing products </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management348
<p>is short and the marketers have to reap the benefi ts of high sales in the shortest possible time. Hence,
heavy doses of advertisements are fed to the customers.
<p>Price Changes
<p>As is known, price is normally the single most important feature of a product, which helps customers
decide about its purchase. Price changes, discount offers, extended guarantees and warranties have
become part of marketing strategy. However, unless the customer gets to know about the changes,
he cannot take favourable decisions. Hence, there is the need to advertise price changes. In order
to motivate customers into buying action price changes are made. If the announcement of price
reduction is made well in advance, the competitors will get time to take pre-emptive measures,
negating any benefi t which could accrue by price reduction in terms of increased sales. Timeliness
is of great importance when fi rms want to announce price reductions. Maruti reduced the price of
their 800 cc car and made a sudden announcement of this, which gave a big boost to its sales during
the ensuing period.
<p>Package
<p>When a fi rm feels that some staleness has crept into their product and product modifi cations are not
possible in the immediate future, they change the package, giving it a modern look, which in turn
attracts the customer&rsquo;s attention resulting in increased sales.
<p>A look at the FMCG fi rms would confi rm that package change is a common phenomenon. And it
does tend to increase sales, provided the customers are made fully aware of the new package, else,
some customers may not buy the product considering it as a new untested product. This is done
through advertising.
<p>Promotional Plans
<p>Firms face loss of market share and sometimes the market shrinks albeit temporarily. In such events,
fi rms want to make purchasing of their products more attractive than that of their competitors. This
is done by means of promotional plans. Buy one get one free, buy a car get a stereo free, get a TV set
and get a walkman free; these and similar offers help fi rms to gain extra share of the market.
<p>In fact, such offers amount to price reduction to an extent. Yet, while price reductions have a tendency
of being of a more permanent nature, promotions can be withdrawn as and when the fi rm thinks it
has achieved its market share goal. Bringing back original prices gives the fi rm back its profi t margin.
However, Maruti took nearly a year before they could restore the original price of its 800 cc model.
<p>Address of the Distribution Channels
<p>Products sell through the distribution channels; the importance of the channels cannot be minimised
unless an alternative system of sale is found out. Firms have to inform the segment customers about </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 349
<p>the location where they can get the product. Therefore they advertise the names, addresses and phone
numbers of the sales outlets. As the channel members also benefi t from the advertisements, fi rms
like to have cooperative advertisement campaigns where the middlemen/persons in the distribution
network contribute towards the advertising expense.
<p>Educating the Customer about Proper Usage of the Product
<p>Some products are highly technical in nature and wrong or improper use of the product could
make it unserviceable. Even cars usage, mileage and functioning would improve if it is maintained
properly. During the sale of manufacturing plants, machinery and capital goods, such education
of the customer is almost mandatory. Even in smaller products like domestic electric appliances,
voltage and current specifi cations are part of the education programme, which is advertised to reach
the target segment.
<p>Retrieving Lost Sales
<p>Sometimes fi rms lose business due to reasons beyond their control, like strike by workers or natural
calamities. In such events, as customers who need the product have bought from competitors, it is
important to advertise the fact that the fi rm is back in business. To further supplement their marketing
efforts, fi rms can resort to some promotional plan and advertise it. This would be the best cover for
the earlier mishap.
<p>Reminder Advertisements
<p>Most general advertising noticed is in the reminder category. Pepsi and Coke advertising blitz,
which often takes the shape of business war, is an excellent example of reminder advertisements.
Amul has been in business for a long time now. It is a well-established brand with a good market
share, innovative marketing and successful reminder advertising. By the way, Amul uses cartoon clips
to good effect in these reminder advertisements. Comic or cartoon clips can be used if the product
justifi es it.
<p>Advertisements for Recruiting Staff
<p>Advertisements are given for the recruitment of staff by fi rms. These could be part of classifi ed
section of newspapers or these could be on special pages. These days most newspapers and business
magazines have sections devoted to recruitment by fi rms.
<p>Recruitment advertising too has an indirect effect as they subtly remind the customers of the
fi rm&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management350
<p>Advertisements to Appoint Distributors, Dealers, Agents,
Retailers, Franchisees and C&amp;F Agents
<p>Advertisements are given to appoint distributors, dealers, agents, retailers, franchisees and C&amp;F
agents. Marketers normally know the people who are in the same trade and they can opt from that
list when planning to appoint a channel member. Advertising can give fi rms a wider selection. In case
of new areas with geographic business expansion, advertisements can be a real boon.
<p>Announcing Financial Results of the Firm
<p>Firms have to declare their semi-annual and annual profi t and loss accounts and the balance sheet.
These periodic results can help in consolidating the brand equity too.
<p>Industrial Products Advertising
<p>For industrial products advertising is meant to assist the salespersons in getting appointments with
the customer personnel. Besides, since normally big money is involved in the purchase of industrial
products, customers need a lot more information in the fi rst instant even to arouse their curiosity.
Hence industrial product advertising takes two different forms as follows:
<p>1. Advertising details of the product.
2. Image-building advertising, which keeps the fi rm in the constant focus of the buyer.
<p>Attracting Investors
<p>Firms planning to get investors to buy their shares resort to heavy advertising to create not just a
ripple but a storm in the fi nancial market so that small and big investors queue up to buy their shares.
There are specialised advertising agencies like Saubhagya and Clea that have the expertise to make
such advertisements.
<p>Aid Firms in Going Global
<p>With global business becoming a fact of life, fi rms would be neglecting international markets at their
own risk and peril. Several Indian fi rms are already multinational corporations and more are to follow.
In such a situation, international advertising has assumed importance. Several MNC advertising agencies
have set up offi ces in India and are providing advertising support for multinational businesses.
<p>The main objectives of advertising are, to increase profi table sales, improve market share and the
brand image. Brand image builds brand equity, which in turn brings brand loyalty.</p>

<p>ADVERTISING AGENCY&mdash;ITS WORKING
In the new millennium, the business scene can be described as having increased competition, seen the
introduction of better products, the availability of new media and the constant threat of new entrants
and substitute products.
<p>Advertising agency have therefore becoming important and yet, background partners of fi rms.
As there are several different types of advertisers there are different types of advertising agencies
to cater to their demand. With specialised product groups coming in the market, like computers and
peripherals, video products, telecom products, the need of specialised agencies has been felt as never
before. Sure enough such agencies are evolving or existing agencies are hiring persons who are
technically qualifi ed to understand the new business.
<p>Let us see a typical organisation chart of a full function advertising agency (see Figure 15.3).
<p>Figure 15.3 Full Function Advertising Agency

<p>Client group 1 Client group 2 Client group 3 Client group 4
<p>Account management Creative services Media services Research services
<p>Account manager/executive Art director, copywriter Press In-house research
<p>Account planner Visualiser Electronic media Outside research agency
<p>A functional head, who has the experience and skills, is positioned in each of the areas&mdash;account
management, creative, media and research. In some agencies they do not have a research department
and they hire the services of outside research organisations like ORG Marg in India.
<p>Full-service agencies are capable of providing the entire range of advertising services to their
clients.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management352
<p>The work of an advertising agency work starts with a brief from the client to their account executive.
The brief constitutes of the following points:
<p>1. Details of the client&rsquo;s activities.
2. Clients market share, brands and their equity.
3. Competitive brands and their value.
4. Marketing objectives.
5. Advertising objectives.
6. An idea of budget meant for advertising.
<p>The role of the advertising agency in marketing efforts of a fi rm can be compared to that of a doctor
who treats a patient and must be told everything necessary for the patient&rsquo;s treatment and cure and
some type of confi dentiality is expected from the agency.
<p>The account executive (AE), works as a close link between the agency and its client. He represents
the client at the agency and ensures that the agency works within the framework of the client&rsquo;s brief
within the allotted time. The word deadline is perhaps the most used word in any agency as it has
to meet the target date of releasing the advertisement campaign to the media after its acceptance
by the client. The AE arranges the agency resources&mdash;creative, media and budgetary&mdash;to get the best
campaign for the client. The AE puts across the agency&rsquo;s plans and the campaign to the client to get
their approval. It is more of a sandwich kind of a role, yet it is very satisfying once the campaigns
planned are executed and bring the desired results.
<p>The creative department is equally important in an advertising agency, whose organisational
structure is shown in Figure 15.4:
<p>Figure 15.4 Advertising Agency Creative Department
<p>The creative director is responsible for the entire creative work of the agency, including copy-
writing, art design work and planning sketches for TV commercials. The visualiser&rsquo;s job is to ensure that
the copy and art is placed at the right places and the total effect of the advertisement is eye catching.
The copywriter writes the copy, the written word in any advertisement. The art director creates the
visuals, the drawings, photos and sketches in the advertising campaign. The art director also works
as the visualiser in most advertising agencies.
<p>They also focus on the suitability of the chosen market segment/s. For this purpose they either have
a research unit of their own or they hire an outside agency for gathering information. Some agencies
have research directors to head the department.
<p>In certain agencies, the trend is to have an account planning department which arranges for the
customers viewpoint, gathered from market research to interact with the creative and media depart-
ments for the best results.
<p>The media director heads the media department where the media research is conducted to fi nd
which would be the right media for the campaign. They plan the media, frequency for advertising; </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 353
<p>its cost and coverage. They are responsible for purchasing media space for print media and time
for the electronic media. The production department does the print, broadcast and telecast production
work, including hiring freelance TV commercial makers.
<p>The traffi c controller department coordinates the work of the different departments in the agency
and ensures that no client&rsquo;s work is side-tracked or delayed.
<p>The marketing department of the agency arranges information on the market segment, what excites
the customers, what are the electronic media, like radio and TV that the target audience uses.
<p>Agency management is conducted on a day-to-day basis, which, among other activities, involves
money and man management.
<p>An agency&rsquo;s organisation chart is given in Figure 15.5:
<p>Figure 15.5 Functional Areas of a Full Service Advertising Agency
<p>Most full-service agencies have similar structures; the designations may differ from agency to
agency. Full-service agencies are geared to provide a complete range of services to its clients, to plan,
create and implement the advertisement as per the client&rsquo;s needs. In India, HTA, Clarion and Lintas
are some of the full-service agencies. The agency proposes complete communication solutions to its
client&mdash;creative, budgetary and the media.
<p>Limited-service agency usually do not provide full service. They concentrate on the creative as-
pects of advertising. They are well appreciated and used by clients looking for high quality creative
work while depending on other sources for media planning and execution of the campaign. They
are also known as creative boutiques or hot shops. Because of their lean organisation, they can be
quite competitive.
<p>Agency of records is a large agency with fi nancial muscle as it buys media in bulk and sells the
space not needed by it at a profi t of 2 per cent to those agencies who are looking for media space at
the peak season.
<p>Specialised agencies operate to serve niche markets like fi nancial advertising, resorted to before a
fi rm plans to have a public issue of its shares. In India Clea and Saubhagya are two such agencies.
<p>Agency profi ts and payments come from commissions they get from the media for selling space
to their clients. The rate of commission in India is 15 per cent. Besides, agencies also get fees directly
from their clients, mark-ups and incentive-based commissions. For media like outdoor, special
boards and directories, the agency puts a mark-up on the price given by the media and gets paid for
its efforts. In the case of incentive-based commissions, the client pays the agency on the basis of the
results obtained by the advertising campaign.
<p>ADVERTISER AND THE AGENCY SELECTION
<p>The advertiser looks into the following aspects of different agencies while making a choice:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management354
<p>1. Experience the agency has in the fi rm&rsquo;s area of business.
2. How creative is the agency. For this purpose either the fi rm can ask for a speculative campaign
<p>or go by the agency&rsquo;s past records.
3. The agency should not be handling competitive products.
4. The agency&rsquo;s reputation for timely execution of campaigns and as being a good agency is
<p>considered.
5. The size of the agency is also a factor considered. Also, fi rms need to fi nd out if they are full-
<p>service advertising agencies or not. Many times the local offi ce may not have all the departments
and the agency might send its work to its head offi ce, a process which can be time consuming.
If the advertisement needs to be made very quickly, such agencies, even if they have a good
reputation, need to be given a miss.
<p>6. Whether the agency has experience of international advertising or not is another criterion to be
considered.
<p>7. The ability of the key persons.
8. Compatibility with the fi rm&rsquo;s personnel.
9. Cost consciousness of the agency. Do they throw away a client&rsquo;s money needlessly?
<p>When an advertiser decides to appoint a new advertising agency, he calls selected agencies to
present their credentials and advertising concepts mainly in line with the fi rm&rsquo;s advertising needs.
<p>The next step is asking the short-listed agencies to present a speculative campaign to the adver-
tiser. Since the speculative plans are time consuming and cost money, many agencies refrain from
making such a presentation. Advertising agencies seldom advertise to get clients. Usually, prospective
clients see their work and the clients approach the agencies. If any agency has to openly go after a client,
it is done subtly through direct mails or informally at social gatherings.
<p>The following gives an idea of how to select an advertising agency:
<p>ADVERTISING AGENCY SELECTION PROCESS
<p>The following is the method of selection used by the advertisers for selecting an advertising
agency:
<p>1. Account contacts: The agency should understand the client&rsquo;s business, both commercially and
technically. If required the agency should hire proper technical staff for the purpose as any
mismatch in understanding the brief could mean more time wasted with the agency and, in
the worst case scenario, the wrong advertising message going to the media and through it to
the ultimate customers.
<p>2. The agency maintains confi dentiality and does not handle competitive products.
3. The agency meets deadlines always as a habit.
4. The agency&rsquo;s staff turnover is within reason.
5. The agency gives great importance to its creative work which is usually good and unique and
<p>not just a distorted copy of some other advertisement, Indian or foreign.
6. The agency maintains a high standard of quality as per the fi rm&rsquo;s needs.
7. The agency has an eye on costs too.
8. The agency has a good rapport with the media and PR consultants.
9. The agency media plan is consistent with the target market segment for the fi rm&rsquo;s products.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 355
<p>10. The agency knows the competition&rsquo;s media strategy.
11. The agency knows the market and can confi rm their claim from their research work.
<p>The relationship between the advertiser and the agency:
<p>1. The advertiser should know the working of the agency and its key personnel.
2. Ideally, the agency should be used as an extension of the advertiser&rsquo;s marketing department.
3. Acceptance of the advertising budget and mode of payment must be clearly defi ned and
<p>understood by both the advertiser and the agency.
4. The agency should allow the advertiser to visit the agency.
5. The agency should simplify its paper work.
6. The AE should understand the structure of the competition.
7. The agency should always meet deadlines.
8. The agency should have specialised people to handle technical aspects of the client&rsquo;s brief.
9. The agency should inform clients about legal and ethical sides of advertising their products.
<p>For best results, advertisers do well by having an advertising manager in their marketing depart-
ment. These managers have to liaise with the advertising agency and other service providers. They
have to understand the 4Ps of their fi rm and of the competition too. They give the brief to the agency.
They have to plan the advertising budget in association with the marketing manager. They are also
required to arrange for press releases as publicity material.
<p>Advertising managers have to assess the effi cacy of the advertising campaigns by keeping a track
of communications both verbal and written received on the basis of the advertising campaign.
<p>A graphic representation of the working of an advertising agency is given in Figure 15.6.
<p>Figure 15.6 Advertising Agency in Operation</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management356
<p>Some large business houses have their own in-house agencies. The advertiser in such cases has
total control over the agency. The agency is tuned to the work culture of the fi rm and thus better
appreciates the type of work required from the agency. They know the product and the plans and
policies well and the brief requirements do become really brief. The agency becomes virtually part of
the fi rm&rsquo;s marketing team and this helps in better-coordinated efforts. The agency also is committed
to providing the same, good service and undivided attention to even smaller fi rms within the larger
organisation.
<p>In-house agencies have the disadvantage of making clients outside the group feeling neglected in
favour of house clients. Hence, the in-house agency has to understand the trade-offs required or it
has to let go of outside commitments.
<p>AGENCY RATING
<p>Advertising agencies are rated by the advertisers on the following parameters:
<p> 1. Creativity, originality and liveliness.
2. Keenness in understanding the client&rsquo;s problems.
3. Management team.
4. Understanding of the market and its problems.
5. Calibre of personnel, their consumer orientation and their experience.
6. Is it progressive and fl exible?

<p>ADVERTISING RESEARCH AND DEFINING ADVERTISING GOALS
FOR MEASURING ADVERTISING RESULTS (DAGMAR)
<p>We have seen that in order to be focused on a fi rm&rsquo;s overall goals, the marketing department has to play a
vital role as the revenue earnings of a fi rm are mainly from selling of products. Hence, once a fi rm&rsquo;s goals
have been formulated, the marketing and advertising people set their own goals and objectives.
<p>Hence, DAGMAR becomes effective only when continuous advertising research is conducted
as per requirements.
<p>ADVERTISING RESEARCH
<p>Advertising research is extensively used by both advertisers and advertising agencies, to pre-test
the campaign, evaluate the media&rsquo;s effectiveness and understand the market segment best suited for </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 357
<p>the fi rm&rsquo;s products. Most fi rms arrange for market research for obtaining the market segment&rsquo;s
viewpoints and preferences about products in their category. These researches tell about product
acceptance levels. Advertising research tells the advertisers about the type of creativity, the language
including slang and dialect that would stimulate the target segment.
<p>It will be diffi cult to fi nd an advertisement of a perfume, which gives its chemical formula. Instead,
the advertisement would talk about love and euphoria created by the perfume. Advertisement are the
result of the research conducted which says that in personal care products people are interested in
what the product would do to them. It is said that nobody buys a product. They buy the performance
promised or given by the product.
<p>Media research is conducted to establish the suitability of a particular medium. Some advertise-
ments have a dotted line cut-out telling the readers to cut it and post the same to the advertiser for
additional information, free samples or a demonstration of the product. The number of prints of the
media is compared to the cut-out responses to know about its readership and correctness of the media
for the target segment.
<p>Research on the advertising copy is done with the help of primary research, when individual
customers are contacted to get their reactions to the advertisement. It confi rms the acceptance level
of the campaign and can be used to determine the frequency of insertions in the media.
<p>Advertising research helps in making advertising campaigns more powerful so that they become
better able to perform the task of meeting the advertising objectives. Advertising costs are high.
Research ensures that the advertisement is creatively acceptable, in the right media with the correct
frequency and for the chosen market segment.
<p>The current Nescaf&eacute; advertisement starts with a woman enjoying a mug full of the brew. Research
had shown that women enjoy coffee during a lull in their work, be it household chores or offi ce work.
Later in the advertisement some men are also shown as it would be too risky to ignore a major customer
group, in fact, 50 per cent of the population.
<p>Advertising research results thus show the advertiser how to place correct advertisements at the
correct places and at the most appropriate times thus making them both effective and effi cient.
<p>After PR, advertisers are interested in fi nding out the likes and dislikes of the customers and reasons
for the same. Research is conducted by doing primary survey and by interviewing customer groups.
Such a research is similar to market research, as information needed is akin to the kind required in
market research.
<p>Advertising research can also be conducted by observation. Researchers stand near shopping malls
and observe the shoppers, their likes and dislikes, their behaviour pattern. Such a researcher has to
note down his observations without prejudice otherwise the deductions would be entirely lopsided.
It may be useful to note that watching/observing customers in shops for collecting data without their
knowledge may not be purely ethical. Also, asking questions may look like a selling gimmicks rather
than advertising or market research.
<p>The next type of research can be termed as idea research where an attempt is made to understand
how some changes in an advertising campaign would affect the result as far as the advertising ob-
jectives are concerned. For example, would an increase in advertising size improve its acceptance, or
its frequency improve top of the mind recall.
<p>Care should be taken in the following areas while planning the research:
<p>1. Time and money spent should be commensurate with the objective of the research. For example,
if the benefi t to be obtained from the research amounts to Rs 2 million, it would not be prudent
to spend Rs 2.5 million on research. In the same way, the time factor must be considered. If for </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management358
<p>instance, research needs to be done concerning the fashion industry it has to be very quick. A
research spanning one year is of no use in the fashion industry where trends become outdated
within that span.
<p>2. Research results would, at best, give indicators for decision-making not perfect answers.
3. Going through the exact methods to be used by the fi eld researchers in detail would make you
<p>more aware of the nitty-gritty and become less vulnerable to problems, which can occur due
to subjectivity of the researchers.
<p>4. Be specifi c about what has to be done rather than leave it to the fi eld people who may come up
with unnecessary, redundant data. It may look good that you are in the know of several
facts, but you should understand the cost and time implications. It is better to get just enough
information.
<p>5. Research budget needs careful analysis. It may be apt to spend some amount of money when
the decision to be based on the research is for large sums of money and it includes avoidance
or limiting risk for the fi rm. Naturally, for simple problems, many times previous experience
is the best guideline for decision-making and no research needs to be conducted.
<p>6. Getting the research done for your book-rack or your shelf only is not a good idea. Unless you
are sure that people who are going to use the research fi ndings it may be only an exercise in
futility. Remember that people generally do not want to change their ways just because of some
research fi ndings.
<p>7. Many times the fi rm may already have the data called for or the information may be available
with another source, for example, with research organisations like ORG Marg.
<p>Secondary research data is available from a variety of sources, as it is research already done by
somebody earlier. Government publications, industry data, magazines and the internet are some of
the sources of secondary data.
<p>Advertising research can be carried out before the launch of the advertising campaign. It helps in
media planning, copy testing along with test marketing the product to be advertised.
<p>Advertising research carried out during the campaign focuses on dealer audit, sales analysis and
customers&rsquo; response based on contests or reply cut-outs given with the advertisements for customers
to fi ll in their comments and send back to the advertiser.
<p>After the campaign gets over, as per DAGMAR, research is done to assess the effectiveness of the campaign
on the parameter of the objective of the advertising campaign. At this time consumer panel surveys are
conducted for structured responses. Consumer panels are predetermined groups of people mostly
of one geographic and demographic segment like lady members of a kitty party. These persons are
in the know of their task of making assessments of the campaigns and inform the advertiser about
their views. Selecting research sample needs knowledge of the market, the universe and quantita-
tive techniques.
<p>Gathering information or data collection can be done by in-depth interviews where the respond-
ent (interviewee, one member of the sample chosen), is asked questions from a well-structured
questionnaire. The respondent can give his own views. A lot of time is given for each question. The
interviewer must be adept at organising such interviews and later on in making a coherent and lucid
report. When the interview is conducted in a well-accepted and known group called the focus group,
the same type of in-depth incisive questions can be asked. The problem that can arise is the confl ict
within a group with diverse views.
<p>The questions can be of two types. They can be simple straightforward types where the answer can
be yes or no. However, when it is important to understand the mindset of the respondents it is better
to use projective questions which can be vague and which would evoke emotional, sentimental and
creative answers.</p>

<p>1. Strongly agree
2. Agree

<p>Surveys, observations and experiments with the help of questionnaires, checklists and plans
help in completing the advertising surveys. Then comes the important aspect of analysis and report
writing.
<p>Research, as stated earlier, must be used or else the time and money utilised is a total waste. Research
results enable fi rms in reassessing their goals on the basis of new opportunities, in confi rming the
target segment and creating a useful message for the segment.
<p>Advertising results can be measured by simple brand recall tests with the target segment. These
can be aided or unaided recalls. Questions like: &lsquo;Which is the best toothpaste in the market?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Which
blue and red bottled drink gives most satisfaction?&rsquo; can be asked.
<p>Research confi rms the strong views held by the fi rm. If there is a major divergence then the objectives,
sample and methods adopted in the research need to be looked at again. A very apt example of how
the research could go wrong is given next:
<p>A fi rm planned to start the manufacture of fax machines in India in 1980s. The task of fi nding
out the demand and product acceptance levels was given to an outside research agency by the
fi rm. The result was fl attering inasmuch that 80 per cent of the respondents were looking forward
to buying a fax machine. When a note was sent to the Department of Telecommunications,
Government of India, it came back saying that the telecom network was not effi cient enough
to make fax a success. (It was only in the late 1980s that digital electronic exchanges and fi bre-
optic cables made the telecom network good enough for fax to operate.)
<p>Advertising research is a part of marketing research, confi ned to the development of the advertising
plan, creative work, market segment and the best possible media that would cater to the segment. The
research should increase the effectiveness and effi ciency of the advertising campaign. Data collection
is done from primary sources as also secondary, already available sources. In primary data collection,
it is important to select the sample correctly. The research steps in the international markets are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management360
<p>1. Setting up goals for the research.
2. Finding the sources of secondary information/data.
3. Analysing the secondary data.
4. Planning sample for primary research.
5. Data collection.
6. Data analysis and report writing.
<p>The advertising campaign is pre-tested and post-tested to ensure that it works. Research does not
provide results or facts, it only gives tendencies. Sample size determines the accuracy levels. At times
it is important to sacrifi ce accuracy for speed.
<p>Guidelines for Making a Questionnaire
<p>International research must take into account the subtle differences in the meaning of words otherwise
the entire research would go waste.
<p>1. Ask basic questions about the respondent&rsquo;s name, address. While asking him his age and
income, give a range: age between 18&ndash;30 years, 31&ndash;45 years, 46&ndash;60 years, 61 years and above,
etc. Income between Rs 3,000&ndash;7,000, Rs 8,000&ndash;15,000, Rs 16,000&ndash;30,000.
<p>2. Questions with possible two answers: Did you buy the watch yourself, yes or no?
3. Multiple choice questions: Who advised you to buy the watch, your father, uncle, sister or
<p>cousin?
4. Likert scale questions: The watch is considered best value for money. Tick the response you
<p>consider right: (a) strongly disagree, (b) disagree, (c) neutral, (d) agree, (e) strongly agree.
5. Differential scale: The hotel is: large &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; small
modern &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; outmoded
Hotel staff is: experienced &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; inexperienced
courteous &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; disinterested
<p>Questions on importance of the product can be put on a scale of extremely important, very important,
important, not very important to not at all important. Intentions to buy can be asked on a rating scale
as sure to buy, perhaps, may not, will not and will never buy.
<p>Open-ended questions like, &lsquo;what do you think of our hotel?&rsquo; can be answered by the respondents
in any way they like. Associations can tell you about the aided recalls, like:

<p>MEDIA PLANNING AND PRODUCT POSITIONING
<p>We have seen, from marketing plans we can develop advertising plans. As a step further, from
the advertising plans the media plans will emerge. Advertising campaigns send messages to the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 361
<p>prospective customers. It is therefore important that the message carrier, that is, the media is chosen
wisely. Besides, the timing and timeliness of the message gives it the required thrust and acceptance.
Major advertising cost comes from the media costs. It becomes imperative that care is taken for proper
and optimum use of the media. Hence the media planning has assumed a vital role in the exciting
game of advertising.
<p>Media Planning
<p>The market place is brimming with a large variety of media. Therefore an intelligent approach in
deciding the proper media is media planning.
<p>Some of the well-known and often used media are:
<p>NEWSPAPERS
<p>They provide information about politics, sports, business and socio-cultural life of a community.
A large percentage, about 80 per cent educated people read newspapers. Educated and well-to-do
people read English language newspapers; others read Hindi or regional language papers. News-
papers are printed from most metro cities and due to heavy competition the prices of newspapers
have been going down. The profi ts of a newspaper come from the advertisements printed in them.
Newspaper owners have not only accepted their role as a vehicle of advertisements, they have
geared themselves up for improved coverage, better print and paper and competitive advertisement
rates. Fast moving consumer goods fi rms having wide distribution network use newspapers. They
are good for providing information about products, fi rms and their local distribution network. The
main shortcoming of newspaper as a media is that the readership of newspapers among the youth
is limited.
<p>Newspapers are of several kinds:
<p> National English language
National Hindi
National business
Regional language
Newspaper supplements
Midday and evening papers
Tabloids
<p>Newspapers have their own advertising departments, which are engaged in selling advertising
space. They pursue both the advertisers as well as the agencies to book the space. Special efforts are
made during festive seasons and occasions like cricket test matches.
<p>The newspaper sells space at a column centimetre rate. There are special rates for special positions
in the newspaper like the front page, solus position, when no other advertisement appears on the
same page/place. Advertisements for sports goods can be usefully advertised on the sports page of
the newspaper. Newspapers are now accepting colour advertisements too. Teaser advertisements are
carried out in split runs in newspapers, when a part of the advertisement is carried in one part of the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management362
<p>newspaper and the rest in the next part. On their part, newspapers carry out surveys about buying
patterns, habits and seasonality of sale of selected products.
<p>The main advantages of newspapers are as follows:
<p> Advertisers can focus on the geographic area they want to cover.
Newspapers get their readers total attention.
Size of the advertisement does not matter.
Advertisements can be put in the newspapers quickly.
It is easy to talk to the readers to know their views about the advertisement.
<p>MAGAZINES
<p>Magazines cater to different categories. There are magazines exclusively for consumers, for fi lm fans,
for women and then there are technical magazines dedicated to science and technology, computers,
and other engineering disciplines like chemical engineering, genetics and medical sciences.
<p>Magazines can be categorised as follows:
<p> Political
Social
Professional magazines for doctors and engineers
Regional language
Film
Computer based
Wild life
Arts
Theatre
Newspaper magazine supplements
<p>Magazines carry information about current events, new developments and plans of the concerned
area. Their coverage is limited, their getup glossy but could be of indifferent quality. They are published
from most major cities and in all possible languages of the land. The price of magazines depends on
its coverage, gloss and can be very different for magazines even from the same town, publisher or
discipline.
<p>Magazines adorn the homes of the elite as also of the commoner. They put the buyers in a special
group and boost their egos. The disadvantage of advertising in magazines can be the excessive clutter
of advertisements in most magazines. And yet, the elite and the busy business magnet have hardly
any time for looking at anything else except some business magazines.
<p>The main advantages of magazines as media are:
<p> It is easy to select magazine for the target segment.
Readership surveys are easy through magazines.
Can plan advertising to equate with the magazines interests.
Message stays with the reader for a long time (as long as the magazine is in front of the
<p>consumer).
Advertising quality can be good.</p>

<p>RADIO
<p>With the advent of television, especially the colour variety, radio has lost much of its appeal at least
in the areas where TV coverage is good and TV signals strong. In the remote villages in India, only
radio is available and it remains a good advertising media. From fi lm music to news, radio provides
entertainment of the audio kind, which is useful for advertising products for rural markets. Frequency
modulation (FM) has emerged as a major technological development because of its excellent voice
quality in a given range of geographic area. Teenagers in metros are hooked to FM radio programmes.
The media caters to the entire country. The media costs are comparatively low for radio.
<p>The major disadvantage of radio as a media is that there is a lot of advertising on this media. The
major advantages are:
<p> It is easy to place the advertisement in local radio station.
It is easy to conduct listeners&rsquo; research.
Can be connected to radio programmes.
It is possible to increase or decrease the advertising frequency within a reasonable notice
<p>period.
<p>TELEVISION
<p>Television is defi nitely the most sought after entertainment media. It can be quite intoxicating in the
sense that people get hooked on to TV programmes. During the fi rst telecast of the epics Ramayana and
Mahabharata, most city people were glued to their TV sets, cancelling even important appointments.
For advertisers, TV is not media with a big reach but also one that allows it to demonstrate its prod-
ucts. These demonstrations along with the advertisement message help to reaffi rm the customers&rsquo;
views in favour of the product.
<p>Television caters to the entire family, as during the day, each member of the family sits down to
watch one or the other TV programme, albeit at separate times. During noon and afternoon, when
the husband goes to work, the housewife watches TV. Without meaning to be gender biased, the pro-
grammers place programmes of women&rsquo;s interest at that time.
<p>Andrew Sullivan wrote in the New York Times Magazine, &lsquo;Meanwhile on TV, America&rsquo;s Fox Family
Channel has introduced two separate channels for boys and girls, boyzChannel and girlzChannel, to
attract advertisers and consumers more effi ciently.&rsquo; Fox executives told Wall Street Journal that this
move refl ects what TV researcher tell them about viewing habits: In general terms, girls are more
interested in entertainment that is more relationship-oriented, while boys are action-oriented.
<p>When TV started for the fi rst time in India in early 1960s, telecast was limited to two hours a day
of black and white programmes. From those days to the present times, with continuous 24 hour
programming and that too on more than 40 channels, TV has taken giant strides forward.
<p>The popularity of TV programmes is such that advertisers are ready to pay huge amounts for
telecasting their advertising fi lms as they provide wide area coverage and reach out to a very large
audience. With demonstrations of the product in use, TV advertising has taken over the role of personal
selling to a large extent.
<p>The only negative aspect of TV advertising is the high cost of advertising. With rising income levels
and the race for purchasing new products, advertising expenses are on the increase with no sign of
coming down. The positive points of advertising on TV are:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management364
<p> Ability to demonstrate the product as a working model.
Creativity can reach new heights.
Advertising quality can be excellent.
Can reach millions of viewers.
It can be telecast as often as the budget permits.
Audience research can be easily conducted.
<p>OUTDOOR MEDIA
<p>In the area where hoardings, billboards and kiosks are placed provide high exposure advertising.
Car owners are the people most affected by outdoor advertising, so much so that in Delhi the govern-
ment has put a ban on outdoor media to avoid distractions caused by hoardings.
<p>The cost of the media is commensurate with its limited usage. The media, where allowed by the
government, is most often used to promote the fi rm, its brand and one single most important (at a time)
product of the fi rm.
<p>The negative aspect of the media is its limited reach, lack of opportunity for giving detailed product
information and in some cases government regulations.
<p>The plus points of advertising on outdoor media are:
<p> Advertiser can select geographic coverage.
Creativity possibilities are good.
<p>POINT OF PURCHASE (POP)
<p>In retail business, POP plays a major role in advertising. The following are the usual POP materials
used:
<p> Posters
Danglers
Sign boards
Streamers
In-store closed circuit TV, which continuously shows product displays at various levels as in-
<p>store commercials
Merchandising that decorates the shop displays
Shop main signboards
Window displays
<p>In most shops due to multiple brands on display, there is a clutter of POP, which takes away the
main benefi ts of POP.
<p>The plus points of POP are:
<p> Consumer research is possible.
Impact is direct on the viewer.
Can be changed easily.
Advertising material creativity can be directed to the shop&rsquo;s clientele&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 365
<p>DIRECT MAIL
<p>This is advertising in the form of letters to customers. The letters can be crafted with a personalised
format and approach. They sometimes take the role as the chosen media, especially in high-value
personal products like digital diary, personal computer and service industry offers like hotel and
airline deals. Care should be taken to ensure that the direct mail letter looks like a normal busi-
ness communication otherwise there are chances that the letter will be put into the waste-paper basket.
With a plethora of mail received by executives, they read only the ones which look businesslike
and readable.
<p>The target market segment can be reached quite accurately with specifi c mailing addresses being
available to the marketers from trade and industry associations.
<p>The cost of direct mail can vary on the basis of quality of the materials used and the size of the
mailing list. Since direct mail is targeted to only the real consumer with no aberrations, they can be
focused and personalised, making the readers feel important. Care should be taken to ensure that
even from the envelope the mailer gives the impression of a personal letter. Else the direct mail has
the possibility of being consigned to the reader&rsquo;s waste-paper basket. As most corporate buyers get
hundreds of direct mailers daily, they have to select only just a few for their perusal. Hence, even with
its close contact with the customer, direct mail remains a back-seat media.
<p>Direct mail scores high on the following points:
<p> Selection of customer groups.
Geographic coverage.
Flexibility in creativity.
Size and frequency of the message can be as desired by the advertiser to suit the product.
Advertisements quality can be good.
<p>CABLE TELEVISION AND SATELLITE CHANNELS
<p>While cable TV provides local programming, satellite channels offer fare from all over the world.
Cable TV is developing quite fast. It gives priority to local news and events. This is a good media for
retail shops, stores and low-volume businesses!
<p>Satellite TV, provide channels from all over the world, like CNN, BBC, Star, Zee, National Geo-
graphic, Animal Kingdom besides our own Doordarshan channels. Each one has its own viewership,
which provides fl exibility and focus for the desired market segment to the advertiser. Satellite TV is
popular with the upper class with a growing spread and with enthusiasts of sports, movies, events
and talk shows.
<p>The media cost of local cable TV is reasonable while satellite TV costs vary on the basis of indi-
vidual programme television rating points (TRPs), which are indicators of programme viewership
and popularity.
<p>The advantages of satellite media are:
<p> Advertisements can cross international boundaries.
Creativity gets major thrust.
National marketing networks can make full use of the media.
Viewership consists of even the elite members of society.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management366
<p>Cable TV has the following plus points for advertisers:
<p> Low cost advertising.
Local brands can use the media to their advantage.
Demonstrations of the working of the products can be done easily.
<p>The quality of telecast of cable TV, however, is suspect at times.
<p>MISCELLANEOUS MEDIA
<p>Starting from yellow pages, to directories, encyclopaedias, rail and air tickets, bus panels, balloons,
elephants and camels the list is endless. Yellow pages, in particular, have caught the fancy of the
middle and upper class in urban India. Most prospective customers use the yellow pages. Its useful-
ness comes from the fact that people look at the yellow pages just before making purchase decisions.
However, most yellow pages do not dynamically promote a particular product. These media are mostly
supplementary media used for reinforcing the main thrust media. Movie halls have slide shows as
also video advertising, which are limited to the audience who are in a way captive and thus forced
to see the advertisements.
<p>A rough estimate of media usage is as follows:
<p>1. Print, including newspapers and magazines&mdash;30 per cent
2. Television&mdash;40 per cent
3. Radio&mdash;7 per cent
4. POP and outdoor&mdash;3 per cent
5. Direct mail&mdash;14 per cent
6. Miscellaneous&mdash;6 per cent
<p>The fi rst three&mdash;print, radio and TV&mdash;are called above the line media while the others are called
below the line media, the distinguishing factor being how the agency gets paid for the use of the media.
In case of the above the line media, the media pays the advertisings agency a commission of 15 per
cent. For below the line media, the agency bills the advertiser with a mark-up on the media bills,
which again is usually 15 per cent.
<p>Each member of the media makes claim of their usage, readership or viewership to woo the ad-
vertising campaigns. While for the print media in India, ABC, an independent body, publishes the
exact print copies giving its coverage and penetration in the segment, for TV, the TRPs indicate the
popularity of a particular TV channel and its individual programmes.
<p>There are other media available now as follow:
<p>1. Videotapes with movies: The number of movies-on-tape hired each year is increasing each year.
With the advent of video disks they will too form a new media in India.
<p>2. Advertisements on computer software discs.
3. Internet has emerged as a major advertising media worldwide because of the following
<p>reasons:
<p> Coverage on the web is worldwide.
Availability of huge amounts of information on the internet.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 367
<p> Entertainment sites like chat rooms.
Creativity is boundless, with little or no censorship so far.
Live demonstrations with audio and video clips makes it really interesting.
Interactivity of the media as it takes the customer from information search stage to buying
<p>action with a few clicks of the mouse (and with the help of credit cards!).
<p>The possibilities of new media emerging are immense and advertisers look keenly for developments
in the area.
<p>Product Positioning
<p>There are several cars in the Indian market. From the low-cost Maruti 800 to Honda City, from Fiat
Uno to BMW. What type of people buy these cars? People buy cars not just for going from one place
to another; they also project their lifestyle through their cars. Car marketers put their cars in the slot
meant for specifi c groups of people. BMWs are positioned for the top bracket of customers, while
Maruti is targeted at the middle-income group.
<p>Chocolates, ice creams and cheese may be your favourite things to eat and then you would have
the brands preferred by you. The mental picture of a product and its brand in your mind is the result
of the advertisements you watch and the product quality. As marketers and advertisers how do you
gain a particular position? It is the sum total of the quality, price and advertising effort which goes
into the product. The marketer therefore attempts product positioning, but actually it is the market
that places a product in its position.
<p>Microsoft has got their product Windows positioned at the top by sheer force of heavy advertise-
ment and consistent quality. Indian car market leaders Maruti (in terms of the volume of business)
would like their customers to believe that their cars offer greater value for money. Followers like
Fiat, Daewoo and Santro would have the customers acknowledge that their cars are as good if not
better than Maruti.
<p>For product positioning the following steps need to be taken:
<p>1. Get the real picture of your product in comparison to the competition. It is better to do a SWOT
analysis of the products in the market including yours without any bias.
<p>2. Select the market segment carefully.
3. Understand the consumer&rsquo;s need, the benefi ts he seeks to get from the product. It will help in
<p>making the advertisements in tune with the consumer&rsquo;s thought process.
4. Check the competitive position.
5. State your product&rsquo;s position.
<p>ADVERTISING BUDGET
<p>As mentioned earlier, the agency gets a brief from the client or the advertiser. Among other informa-
tion, the brief contains the client&rsquo;s budget, which has been earmarked for spending on advertising.
It therefore becomes the job of the agency to prepare the advertising campaign keeping in view the
allocated budget.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management368
<p>Several times the agency, however, fi nds that the budget is not exactly adequate for doing justice to
the objective/s of the advertisement. If the difference is minor, the agency can persuade, in the interest
of the campaign&rsquo;s success, the client to revise the budget upwards. In case of major differences it is
necessary that the agency be prepared to defend the extra expenditure on advertising they want the
client to incur. Major expenditure in the campaign is required depending on the media used. In case
of below the line media, the agency adds a percentage on money spent, usually 15 per cent towards
their cost coverage and profi t.
<p>The methods used in deciding the advertising budget are:
<p>1. International laws on advertising taxation.
2. Launch of the product advertising.
3. Main competitors&rsquo; budgets.
4. Based on the fi rm&rsquo;s objectives for advertising.
5. Historical sales method.
6. Task based.
7. Arbitrary method.
8. Criterion of affordability.
9. Top drawer.
<p>Let us discuss these methods in detail.
<p>PRODUCT LAUNCHES
<p>When fi rms bring out new products in the market, they have to achieve the following for a successful
launch of the product:
<p>1. Create product awareness among the target market segment.
2. Provide knowledge about the availability of the product.
3. Make the consumer understand the main benefi ts provided by the product.
4. Provide the consumer knowledge about the service available for the product.
5. Provide knowledge about multiple usage of the product if relevant.
6. Find peripheral segments for the product.
<p>Simply put, the product can never be purchased unless the customers are in the know of the same.
For the cottage industry, when production levels are low, word-of-mouth publicity helps in mak-
ing the product known to prospective customers. Word-of-mouth publicity is an effective form of
making people aware of the product and it happens without any apparent effort on the part of
the marketer. And since it is not paid for, it does not fall in the category of advertising.
<p>Product launches, therefore, require concentrated advertising effort, which increase the budget
manifold. However, depending on the product, the market segment and the geographic area to be
covered, the budget can be suitably made.
<p>During the launch stage of the product, availability of the product for the target segment has to be
ensured. Also, if the customer wants to buy the product he must know where he can get it. Imagine a
situation where a heavily advertised product is not available in the market. It will surely result in the
customer buying a competitive product and when the product does become available the competition </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 369
<p>would have taken a march over the advertiser. Of course, if product shortage is created as a strategy
to generate demand, care should be taken to monitor and watch the situation closely.
<p>Products are purchased for the benefi ts they offer to the customer. Any advertising has to cover
these benefi ts. Writing the benefi t story may take time and space and increase the advertising budget.
Considering the importance of the benefi t story, especially in the product launch stage, spending the
extra rupee would be well worth it.
<p>Most products need to be serviced to be able to give the benefi ts promised. Hence, the customer
must be told about the availability of service facilities. There is a bit of a risk factor in over- or under-
budgeting the advertising campaign.
<p>Most FMCG fi rms spend 7&ndash;10 per cent of their sales revenue in advertising. Procter &amp; Gamble
spends about 6 per cent of its sales revenue on advertising while Unilever spends 7.5 per cent. Ad-
vertising is considered as an investment by fi rms. The advertising budgets are made after gathering
a lot of information like the competitive situation, market growth, PLC and test reports of advertising
sample response. Marketing and advertising goals are then framed, which give the geographic and
demographic coverage of the market. The advertising budget gives the money value of the advertising
plan. The client approves the budget and only after that does any advertising action like release of
advertisements in the media take place. Depending of the agency&ndash;client relationship, sometimes the
agency can book the space in advance. Later on the agency has to maintain control on advertising
expenses in line with the approved budget. In case media rates increase, prior approval of the client
is needed.
<p>There are several methods used in selecting the advertising budget. The most commonly used
are:
<p>1. Sales volume percentage: For example, if the previous years&rsquo; sales of the fi rm was Rs 100 million,
5 per cent of it would put the advertising budget at Rs 5 million. The percentage is worked out
on the basis of the fi rm&rsquo;s historical budget, industry norms or on the basis of prevailing market
conditions. If the market has started an upward trend then 1 per cent extra could be put for
the advertising budget. Following the method without considering market conditions could
create major problems. If the fi rm&rsquo;s market share has been going down, the management may
decide to increase the advertising budget. However, if the product is in the decline stage of the
PLC, the fi rm could consider divestment. In such an event, only marginal advertising efforts
to help clear the stocks may be enough. On the contrary, even in the decline stage of the PLC,
if the fi rm fi nds that competitive fi rms are getting out, they may go for taking the leadership
position and pick up the demand left over by competing fi rms, before fi nally closing down.
<p>2. Unit of sale: Consumer durable fi rms like car makers use this method as a variant on sales
percentage. While mostly it works out the same as the percentage method, here the fi rm puts
an amount of advertising expense on the car as an add on.
<p>3. Competitive parity method: Information regarding the competition&rsquo;s sales, distribution pattern
and advertising must be carefully studied by the fi rm. It will provide the correlation between
the competition&rsquo;s sales and advertising effort. Depending on the fi rm&rsquo;s strategy of increasing
market share, or steadying the share, a decision can be made to have a bigger or smaller budget
than the competition. However, instead of reacting to competitive advertising results, fi rms
would do well to be proactive in their approach to marketing by planning their own goals of
marketing and then the advertising budget would emerge from the same.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management370
<p> 4. Meeting the objectives method: Marketing and advertising people are tuned to the objec-
tives they have made for them to achieve. Working backwards, taking each item on the list
of objectives like increasing geographic sales area, increasing market awareness by a certain
percentage over the fi gure obtained from advertising research, they add up the amounts
needed for each activity. The advertising team, both of the fi rm and the agency, best accepts
this method.
<p> 5. Historical method: In this method, the previous year&rsquo;s advertising budget is adopted with
a view that practically no change has taken place in the market and market growth is slow,
which does not justify any addition to the budget. As an additional feature to this method,
the previous year&rsquo;s budget could be multiplied by a factor to cover increase in media rates.
<p> 6. Affordability method: Some fi rms believe that advertising is perhaps necessary and yet not
important enough. They make budgets for all the other expenses like raw material purchase, salary
and wages, power and rents and they consider the balance amount in the budget as the advertis-
ing budget.
<p> 7. Total group budget: In case of a multiple unit organisation, a total amount is decided as the
advertising budget and each unit gets a share of this according to their needs. This method
helps the group to segregate some amount for corporate group advertising for building the
image of the group.
<p> 8. Percentage of the anticipated turnover: This method is useful in markets that are dynamic,
when the product is in the steep of PCL, as it provides for potential business as well.
<p> 9. Elasticity method: This method takes into consideration seasonality of business as also its
periodicity. It has been known that some products have better sales every two years or every
fi ve years as economy booms appear with certain periodicity. This method takes into view
the demand and supply situation and used mainly for industrial products.
<p>10. Ideal campaign: When a fi rm is in a do or die situation, in order to survive, the fi rm resorts
to a budget which can give them the ideal advertising campaign, resulting in a turnaround
for the fi rm.
<p>11. Market model or operations research: Market research gives the comparative fi gures of sales
as per the advertising effort and a decision is made in accordance with the desired sales. For
example:
<p> For an advertising budget of Rs 100,000, the sales would be worth Rs 1,500,000.
For an advertising budget of Rs 300,000, the sales would be worth Rs 4 million.
For an advertising budget of Rs 500,000, the sales would be worth Rs 15 million.
<p>12. Per capita population basis: This method takes the total population to be served and an
amount is fi xed for each member of the population. It is used in generic products, which are
not differentiated and have a large number of common buyers.
<p>13. Flexi-plan: In this method, the budget is not fi rmed up and is changed as per market demands.
In today&rsquo;s world of increasingly severe competition, many fi rms resort to this technique of
budgeting.
<p>14. Composite method: This method takes into consideration several factors in formulating the
advertising budget as follows:
<p> Firms past sales.
Future sales projections.
Production capacity.
Market environment.
Sales problems.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 371
<p> Effi ciency level of sales personnel.
Seasonality of the market.
Regional considerations.
Changing media scenario and changing media impact on the target market segment.
Market trends and results of advertising and marketing research.
<p>Estimates of advertising expense in some industries as a percentage of their turnover is given
next:
<p>1. Cold drinks&mdash;10 per cent
2. Cosmetics&mdash;11 per cent
3. Games and toys&mdash;14 per cent
4. Air courier service&mdash;1.5 per cent
<p>Advertising budget should be kept fl oating in increasing order as long as the incremental sales
generate profi t which offsets the extra money spent on advertising. It must be remembered that fi nd-
ing a direct relation between extra advertising and additional sales generated is at best a theoretical
exercise, as there are numerous other reasons, other then extra advertising which also help in increasing
sales, like improved distribution network, better availability, promotional plans.
<p>Most widely used approach to advertising budget is percentage of sales, which could result in heavy
advertising of well-known, established. The objective and task based budget helps in focusing on more
appropriate advertising plans and these help in reaching the objectives to a large extent.
<p>Budget fi nalisation is normally done by interaction between several members of the fi rm who put
forth their views and justify them. Many times it is the owner of the fi rm who ultimately prevails over
others rendering the exercise useless.
<p>In the past, historical data was a good indicator of amount required for achieving the objectives.
With increasing competition, it has become imperative that a close watch is kept on the market and
competition.
<p>CREATIVE STRATEGY&mdash;ART AND COPY
<p>As can be imagined, with media as diverse as newspaper, magazines, TV, internet and outdoors, an
advertising agency has an interesting and tough job creating the advertisement. Usually, the press
advertisement consists of art and copy. For written advertisements, art and copy are put on the paper.
For TV and radio advertisements, moving pictures and sound are also required.
<p>Advertising and Creativity
Usually the advertisement consists of art and copy. The diversity makes the creative jobs interestingly
diverse. And therefore people involved are also mostly different.
<p>In print media, copy can usually be created with unlimited imagination. Using words in different
font sizes and designs, numbers, pictures, sketches, cartoons and placing these as per a design creates
a large unlimited variety of copy. The size of the advertisement matter or copy can be also as per the
media. A long-worded copy is used to fi ll the page and also to make information about the product
available to the prospective customers. A short copy can be used for making a teaser advertisement
or to differentiate the advertisement from the usual run of the mill advertisements.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management372
<p>The art work can use pictures, photographs, cartoons, sketches, paintings, with the possibility of
placing these at any part of the advertisement, in any size or shape. Logos are the trademark of brands;
they are the fi rm&rsquo;s signatures used in print advertisements. Sometimes, charts, tables and fi gures are
used as well. Depending on the target market segment, stress can be on celebrity endorsers of the
product, with their photographs in action. For products for children use of animals is considered
useful. Use of colour, open spaces, borders enhances the impact.
<p>For radio or purely audio advertising (it could include pre-recorded cassettes too), the listeners
are going to listen and not read or see the advertisement. It becomes important to select the spoken
words with care. Besides, the voice of the speakers and singers should suit the lyrics and the product.
The music, both the accompanying music and background music need to be selected with care
and must be appropriate to the situation. Special effects can create the needed ambience of the
advertisment.
<p>Television offers the maximum opportunity for creativity. Being an audio-visual media, it offers
maximum attractiveness. As a low-cost means of entertainment, a large number of people get hooked
on to TV. In fact, the term couch potato has been coined for people who are addicted to TV.
<p>Television offers the greatest challenge to the creativity of the advertising agency. Not only does
it offer the chance to demonstrate the product, it can keep the sustained interest of the viewers. It
naturally calls for specialised people who are experts in their fi elds. This, in turn, has generated
numerous jobs like jobs for ad-fi lm producer, fi lm directors, musicians and models. These will be
discussed in some detail later in this chapter.
<p>Let us examine creativity from the viewpoint of the customer, whom we are trying to attract.
Going by Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs on one side and the benefi ts provided by the product, the
job of the creative person is to match the main and important needs of the customers in the target
segment with the appropriate benefi ts. For example, the benefi t of a lower price for bathing soap
(from Rs 60 to Rs 50) would have little impact on the high-income segment. Perhaps, more import-
ant would be the skin-care elements of the soap.
<p>Pick up any advertisement of an expensive luxury soap and you will fi nd that the advertiser is
talking about bringing beauty and soft skin to the users and only pretty nubile models are chosen to
endorse the soap.
<p>The Indian Scene
<p>India is a country rich in culture and cultural diversity with festivals all year round. Advertisers
fi nd the festival time well suited to promote some products. During Deepavali, the exchange of gifts
is considered essential. Gift manufacturers make special efforts just before Deepavali to advertise
their products. Festivities themselves provide various options for catching the attention of the target
segment, as has been amply proved by soft drink marketers. Deepavali, Eid, Ganesh Chaturthi see
a surge in advertisements. This is because one, on festivals people are on holiday and two, they are
in the mood to spend. Firms give annual bonuses to their employees during Deepavali, which helps
the buyers to be more fl exible with money.
<p>The use of Indian classical music, fi lm and folk music enhances the appeal of radio and TV adver-
tisements. The seven notes of music make Indian music resplendent with myriads of subtle variations
and certain market segments are defi nitely appreciative of the same. Indian theatre dates back to
centuries when Banbhat and Kalidas moved the populace with their dramatic artistry. Today, the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 373
<p>theatre movement has again come to the fore and with it scriptwriters and other dramatis personae.
The element of suspense and surprise, a sure winner in drama is also very successful in advertise-
ments as is humour.
<p>Family planning and other social issues like literacy, health and education all use drama and street
plays to their advantage. As people enjoy the play, the social message is put across to the captive
audience. As the message is built into the theme, the audience are not likely to walk out of the play.
Rural advertising uses street plays effectively to reach the message to the audience.
<p>The task before the copywriter is to make the copy exciting, original, easy to understand, logical
in sequence with movement and unifi ed.
<p>The Design Theory
The design concepts as practised in copy writing are as follows:
<p> 1. Unity in headline of the advertisement, art, copy, logo and the fi rm&rsquo;s signatures.
2. Innovation: Variety, as it is said, is the essence of advertising.
3. Balance: The advertisement should look balanced.
4. Rhythm: The advertisement should have a natural fl ow and have lucidity.
5. Harmony: The advertisement should be pleasing to the reader&rsquo;s eyes.
6. Emphasis: The advertisement should provide stress at the right places.
7. Excitement: The advertisement should make people look up and notice it.
8. It should be eye catching, as most advertisements are not even seen by the target audience.
9. It should arouse curiosity. The use of teaser advertising is a good example.
10. Repetitive: Repetition helps in customer retention and top of the mind recall.
11. Creating wonderment. The advertisement should be awe-inspiring.
<p>It may be of interest at this stage to know how some advertisements get killed. We see many ad-
vertisements on television and in newspapers and magazines, which are over done. The repetition
is too much, rendering them unpalatable to the target audience. There has to be fi ne balance. There
should be the right amount of exposure. Wrong timing can kill any advertisement like nothing else
can. Advertising woollen clothes in summer can be a fruitless exercise. Sometimes advertisements
are placed in the media even before the product is made available in the market and before the dis-
tribution channels have been set up.
<p>If retailing is not properly organised and salesmen are not well-trained then the advertising effort
can become useless. If the product is not properly priced it may have a poor effect on sales, the prime
objective of advertising. Lower price may be construed as denoting a lower-quality product and a
high price could out-price the product in the market in the present competitive age.
<p>With suspected quality of the product and without proper after-sales service, no amount of ad-
vertising can help the product. If the media chosen for the target segment is the wrong one, it can
derail any good advertisement. Similarly, wrong segmentation of the market will cause heartburns
to the advertiser. Esoteric advertising or brash or high fl outing messages would not cut any ice with
the target segment.
<p>Creativity in advertising calls for an overview of the market, the competitive situation and the
fi rm&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. In fact, a SWOT analysis is done which provides lot of ideas for
creativity. The following areas need special attention:</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management374
<p>1. The objectives laid down for advertising: Advertising is an invaluable aid for informing and
persuading the target segment in favour of the product.
<p>2. The target market: The copywriter must have a good knowledge of the segment the marketer
is targeting. Many times the segment tells what it wants to read or see. The teenage and young
adults targeted by cold drink makers, like Coke and Pepsi put the words in copy as spoken by
the teens and young adults. Going to any upwardly mobile college can be a revealing experience
as far as the language spoken there is concerned. It hardly sounds like English. A lot of slang
words are used in addition to newly-coined words like funda.
<p>For getting the right creative message, it is best to fi nd out the most important benefi t the product
will provide the customers and build the copy around it. An example would help understand how
this is done:
<p>1. Maruti Esteem cars are advertised as comfortable family cars.
2. Dove soap is advertised as soap for people who want to have good skin as it takes full care of
<p>your skin.
3. Santro cars are advertised as trouble-free, state-of-the-art cars.
<p>Once the main benefi t is given as the headline, other smaller benefi ts can be put in the body copy
along with the distinctive features, which help the product deliver the benefi ts.
<p>The sale of sewing machines has been dipping as women do not have any time to stitch clothes
and readymade garments are easily available in the market. If the sewing machine sells it is be-
cause the sellers are making an emotional appeal to women that even when you have very little
time, if you stitch your own designer clothes and embroider it with the different types of stitches
available in the modern machines, you can show off your handiwork to your friends and relatives
their with pride.
<p>Thinking and idea generation is the basic function of the human brain. And yet, copywriters fi nd
that getting the right idea is far from easy. Copywriters have to follow the idea that they must, like
all creative people, live a full life, understanding the variety and subtle nuances of living.
<p>Advertising deals with people&rsquo;s logic and emotions. When a car maker talks about acceleration,
braking torque or seating capacity, he is appealing to people&rsquo;s logic or their minds. As the talk transfers
to the air-conditioned luxury or magical colours of the car, the appeal is to the heart. In practically all
advertisements, the appeal is to the heart and the mind.
<p>Both the human heart and mind are used in the decision-making process. The appeals are made
in the following areas:
<p>1. Value for money: This appeal gives the customer the satisfaction of being a careful, clever
buyer.
<p>2. Quality appeal transfer is for ego boosting: I buy only the top stuff.
3. Indirect appeals are made by using sponsors and celebrities to endorse the product. Celebrities
<p>attract the viewer&rsquo;s attention and also provide help in decision-making. Suiting endorsed by
Shah Rukh &lsquo;Mayur&rsquo; Khan gives the viewers a chance of personality transfer: If I wear Mayur
Suitings, I will look like Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 375
<p> 4. Who says so: This becomes important in high-value products. Top star Tabu endorses Samsung
products giving the impression that not only does she use them, but she also fi nds them to be
to her liking.
<p> 5. Most people believe that they are the best in looks, intellect, appearance, and sense of humour.
A top model and an ex-Miss India says that she uses L&rsquo;Oreal products &lsquo;because I am worth it&rsquo;.
Ego satisfaction and personality mindset helps in extending user acceptance from the endorser
to the customer.
<p> 6. An appetising dish does more to make one feel hungry than any amount of verbose writing.
When people see the dish they want to eat it even on full stomach. A well-tailored suit on a
model has a bigger appeal than sketches of the suit and description of the cloth. Humans have
fi ve basic senses&mdash;the sense of touch, taste, hearing, seeing and smelling. Advertisers use all
these senses to focus the customer&rsquo;s mind on their products.
<p> 7. Social cause advertising uses fear and anger to draw the attention of the target audience. The pre-
vention of AIDS through safe sex, small family for family health and welfare, drug de-addiction
for life, are some of the areas where the appeal of fear and anger are used to concentrate on
the safety and security aspects of Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs.
<p> 8. People making cosmetic products among others use love appeal: Use Axe deodorant and see
the effect on the opposite sex.
<p> 9. Appeal to the subconscious mind is done subtly in movie halls when some advertisements
are fl ashed on the screen for a fraction of a second barely visible to the theatre-goers. Even
then, the effects of such advertisements have been good. Showing a slide for Coke increased
its sale in the intermission considerably.
<p>10. Anything done in a highly creative manner will have a positive impact on the customers.
Sometimes advertisements with negative concepts like the Onida TV advertisement featuring
the devil did wonders for the product.
<p>Creativity can be organised and planned by gathering information about the product, market,
competition and the laws.
<p>ART DIRECTION&mdash;ELEMENTS OF DESIGN
Art makes the entire advertising eye-catching, full of life. Advertising is made catchy by having a
strong and dynamic copy. At other times it is done by using attractive art and graphics. Most of the
times, it is a combination of the two, which helps the advertisement become eye-catching. Breath-taking
advertisement, an attention-getting campaign, top of the mind recall&mdash;all these come with imaginative
art and copy and total visuals. Some aspects of how to have good art are discussed next:
<p>Size
It plays a vital role in attracting attention. Depending on the product, headlines can be of strong
thick lines to draw people to reading it. Medium-size lettering can make the advertisement look like
a news item and this has its own impact. The idea is to highlight in bigger fonts. However, in case of a
solitary advertisement on a page perhaps small print could be more useful.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management376
<p>Colour
<p>It sets the entire tone of the campaign, creating or generally going with the mood needed for the
acceptance of the product. Persistence of a colour scheme helps in faster and easier brand recognition.
Colour advertisements are 20 times more eye-catching and hence tend to pay for the extra costs
involved. In international advertising, care should be taken to ensure that the colour scheme matches
with the sensibilities of the country for which the advertising campaign is meant. In China, for instance,
yellow/gold is associated with purity and religion. In Mexico, yellow is the colour of death.
<p>Line
<p>Straight lines, curves and scratchy lines all have their individual effect. Curves look graceful, while
vertical lines provide a standard of decorum, horizontal lines provide peace and dignity. Diagonal
lines show strength in the advertisement.
<p>Shape
<p>Shapes can be used effectively to cover the space of the advertisement. Rectangles, squares, oblongs
and circles all have their value in catching the consumer&rsquo;s eye. Product cut-outs, mainly used in POP
danglers, can also be used to focus the attention of the viewers.
<p>Advertising designs are planned on the basis of proportion, lucidity and balance. The idea is to
have eye-catching visuals to attract the viewer&rsquo;s attention. These are shown graphically in Figures 15.7
and 15.8:
<p>Figure 15.7 Balance in Press Advertisements</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 377
<p>Figure 15.8 Proportion in Press Advertisements
<p>Balance in advertisements comes from imagining an axis around which the advertisement has to
be made, or around which it should look like it is moving. Balance gives grace to the advertisement
and helps in affecting the viewers through their psyche.
<p>Proportion takes into account the objects shown and their physical shapes and dimensions to
make the right impact.
<p>Lucidity or fl ow comes from the order in which the key elements are put in the advertisement.
The advertisement story should come out without any jarring notes to be effective.
<p>The advertisement should look complete in every way and the art and copy should complement
each other. For improved recognition the advertisement should lay emphasis on the main points,
which is to highlight the benefi t story.
<p>Before fi nalising the advertisement it is necessary to know &lsquo;is it exciting enough?&rsquo;, does it arouse
the curiosity of the readers, does it carry enough punch?
<p>Print advertisements are designed in a number of ways:
<p>1. Carry a tale, an action and its reaction
<p> This is used, for example, in shampoo advertisements where everyone can see the results of
using that particular shampoo. Pre-use and after use photos, still or in action have a dramatic
effect on viewers.
<p>2. Use of the latest news
<p> Lux toilet soap for instance used the fact that three Indian women won coveted international
beauty pageants in the same year to promote their product: Be like the Indian beauty queens,
all three in a row, Miss Universe, Miss World and Miss Asia Pacifi c in the year 2001. Use Lux
toilet soap.
<p>3. Teach
<p> Advertisements can teach the consumer about the benefi ts of the product. For example, they
might teach the consumer that using besan for cleaning one&rsquo;s hair is outmoded. They should
use the fi rm&rsquo;s hair rejuvenating shampoo that is already changing the lives and hairstyles of
all the consumer&rsquo;s friends.
<p>4. Art dominating advertisements
<p> You can use minimum copy, may be just a word, or at best a sentence and let the art dominate
the advertisement.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management378
<p>5. Copy dominating advertisements
<p> These advertisements have a lot of information to give, like in industrial product advertis-
ing. In copy different font types and sizes can be used for creating the desired effect. For
example:
<p> The Advertising Challenge
<p> The Advertising Challenge
<p> The Advertising Challenge
<p> The Advertising Challenge
<p>The page layout in print advertisements is important. The agencies start by cutting and pasting to
create the press advertisement. After discussing the advertising in general let us get to international
advertising campaigns.
<p>INTERNATIONAL ADVERTISING
<p>With globalisation Indian fi rms are trying to succeed in the international markets. For most fi rms it
has become imperative to go overseas to do business as they are fi nding that international players
who have come to India are taking away their market share. It may be a good idea to hit them in their
own markets for which Indian fi rms need to know how to cultivate the international markets. The
partial convertibility of the rupee has helped fi rms earn and keep part of the foreign exchange which
they can use for importing raw materials and components. Hence, for most fi rms foreign markets are
crucial for continued growth and profi tability.
<p>To market Indian products to foreign buyers you require an understanding of how advertising
works in other countries. You need the knowledge of communicating with customers/consumers in
the international markets.
<p>Table 15.3 gives the percentage of gross national product spent by countries on advertising to give
you an idea of its importance in a nation&rsquo;s economy:
<p>Table 15.3 Advertising Expenditure in Different Countries
<p>Country Percentage of GNP
<p>USA 2.02
Sweden 1.88
The Netherlands 1.77
UK 1.74
Switzerland 1.59
Australia 1.37
<p>India spends about 0.3 per cent of its GNP on advertising.
Next, we discuss the challenges faced and the methods of advertising in different countries.</p>

<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 379
<p>Russia
<p>With the disappearance of the USSR, Russia has opened up its economy. Now it has two classes, the
rich and the poor. The rich class demands quality consumer goods in large numbers. It would be
worthwhile to learn the Russian language, its slang and idioms to communicate in the language best
understood by the customers. International players have opened their offi ces in Russia. They advertise
in the local press, TV and at the point of purchase (POP). Russia is looking for perishable goods and
even old technology products. There is a demand even for second-hand goods.
<p>Methods of advertising in Russia:
<p>1. Advertising must provide exact information about the products.
2. Explain in detail the uses of the products.
3. New kinds of products are needed.
4. Advertising should create tastes and develop needs. A lot of concept selling is required.
5. Products, which show lifestyles, achievements, are a must.
<p>China
<p>South China is quite an advanced market. In Hong Kong and several major cities in this area, outdoor
advertising has been used quite effectively for some time now. The reach of TV is increasing and is
a major source of communication.
<p>Demonstration of products, how effective they are in reality is what the Chinese customer
wants to see before spending money. Television is therefore the most appropriate media where live
demonstrations can be given. Testimonials by experts are favoured and can reap rich harvest for the
advertisers.
<p>International advertising can also be when national companies go global and advertise worldwide.
There are two approaches to global advertising:
<p>1. Global: Where one set of advertisements are used the world over.
2. Multi-domestic: Where advertising campaigns are modifi ed to suit the national sentiments of
<p>the countries you are communicating with.
<p>National economies are interdependent and international trade has doubled in each decade. The
US imports the following each year:
<p>1. Watches&mdash;70 per cent
2. Cameras&mdash;60 per cent
3. TVs&mdash;45 per cent
<p>You can name several MNC brands available in India today.
The following are the methods of starting international advertising:
<p>1. Selecting an advertising agency: You have the choice of an Indian agency, Indian agency with
foreign collaboration, and foreign agency with offi ces in India.</p>

<p>2. Many countries such as Canada go by a nationalistic approach and in such countries it may be
a good idea to appoint a local agency. Local agencies provide the goodwill of the target market.
<p>3. If there is no binding then select the best agency.
<p>The following are some of the international agencies in India:
<p> 1. J. Walter Thompson
2. Dentsu Japan
3. MaCann Erickson
4. Young and Rubicon
5. Ogilvy &amp; Mather
6. Ted Bates
7. SSC&amp;B Lintas
8. BBDO
9. Leo Burnett &amp; Foote
10. Cone and Belding
<p>What message should be used in international advertising?
<p>1. Indian message.
2. Ethnic with local colour, with words phrases used in a particular culture.
3. In large, multi-cultural countries, a common message appealing to the masses can be used.
4. Language barrier can be overcome by using a local agency.
5. Standard appeals like for Coke, Mercedes, Levi jeans offer recognition anywhere in the world.
<p>These have advantages of cost, repeat value. At best you can change the models and use local
faces. International advertisements help people associate themselves with the lifestyles of the rich
and progressive. Such advertisements have easier coordination, campaign preparation is simpler and
international travellers recognise the product anywhere in the world.
<p>SALES PROMOTION
<p>The business environment the world over has undergone sea changes in the last decade, more so
because of the political upheavals, like the disintegration of the USSR, opening up of China, turmoil
in the Far East economies. Let us understand the business environment, as it exists in India today:
<p>1. Severe international competition.
2. Large middle and upper-middle consumer class.
3. Changes in money supply and interest rates.
<p>These factors have lead to an era of continuous sales promotion. It is therefore important to learn
what sales promotion is and how it can be made effective. With the number of products in each
group increasing, the customer is the main benefi ciary. However, he is also a bit confused as each
advertiser is telling the benefi t story to him. The need to give that extra benefi t to clinch the order
leads to promotion.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 381
<p>Consumers need extra stimulus to buy the product. The dealers or retailers need that extra benefi t
to stock and push the product. These promotional activities must be advertised to be of any value in
increasing market share. In sales promotion, the marketers are giving some thing extra. This is in lieu of
price reduction. Price reduction, unlike promotion, gets to be an extended expense while promotional
expense can be withdrawn any time you feel you have achieved your objectives.
<p>Sales promotion provides extra incentive, an offer of direct inducements that enhances the basic
value of a product for a limited time to stimulate immediate distributor commitment, sales force ef-
fectiveness and consumer purchasing. Coke and Pepsi advertise in order to promote sales as well as
to encourage the retail trade to keep their products.
<p>Customer promotion is achieved by the following:
<p>1. Test our new product or re-buy. Added incentives make people give new products a try.
2. Be loyal to us, we are there to look after you through our promotional plans.
3. Buy more. The Pepsi tagline is &lsquo;yeh dil mange more&rsquo;&mdash;the heart wants more.
4. Buy our entire range. For this purpose sometimes products are bundled together.
<p>Promotion increases sales immediately. It helps in advertising and other marketing efforts like
personal selling. It is very important to advertise the promotions so that the customer gets to know
about it. Lack of advertising for the target market will render the promotion campaign unrewarding
and the objectives will not be met.
<p>Trade promotion helps in the following manner:
<p>1. Gets better distributors.
2. Better shelf space at the retail stores.
3. Superior merchandising.
4. Increases stocks and pushes sales.
5. Trains the sales personnel of the retailers.
6. Better product knowledge (as a spin off).
7. Improvement in dealer responses in the future.
<p>Sales promotion takes up to 70 per cent of the total marketing budget and hence it is a major factor
that needs constant nurturing. The main reasons for the shift towards promotion are as follows:
<p>1. Immediate results: With the focus on meeting target sales promotion provides quick response
techniques.
<p>2. Measuring effectiveness: As the results are quick to achieve, promotional plans results can be
seen early.
<p>3. Retailers have acquired a status they never had, as through computerised information base
they know their customers, their buying powers and habits best. Therefore, promotion plans
with retailers at the hub can be most effective.
<p>4. Increased competition and the plethora of products make you vie for the customer&rsquo;s money.
Advertising may not provide the motivation needed for making customers buy your
products.
<p>5. Buyer&rsquo;s loyalty is limited and can be enhanced with active participation of the retailers. Since
your competitors are doing exactly the same, you have to be on the constant look out for better
and more rewarding promotional plans both for your customers and your retailers.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management382
<p>There are various ways of product promotion:
<p>1. Buy one get one free
2. Buy now, pay later
3. Take a free sample with each purchase of our other product you just purchased
<p>Many fi rms offer discount coupons as incentive to buy at a lower price. When the customer goes
to redeem the coupon a good salesman can sell a lot of the company products. At least the customer
would have tried your product and he may like it so much that he buys it again.
<p>Special low-cost packs are offered as promotion to encourage trial. Similarly, some fi rms give
money-back offers where in the unlikely event of the customer not liking the product he can get
his money-back. Experience shows that hardly anyone ever comes to return a product for cash, un-
less the product is defective. Contests are also used as sales promotions. Colgate offers, millions of
rupees, besides other goodies like computers as contest gifts. Hotels and airlines offer high usage
discounts and free tickets for frequent fl yers as part of their promotion plans.
<p>Trade promotion plans offer the following to the retailers:
<p>1. Display incentives for better merchandising and shelf use.
2. Short-term discounts for inventory control and sales push.
3. Turnover discounts are given for achieving sales targets.
4. Assistance in running sales contests among the retailers&rsquo; salespersons.
5. Cooperative advertising with the retailers where the advertising expense is shared on a mutually
<p>agreed basis.
<p>Sales promotion is an offer of direct money saving to the customer without diluting the product&rsquo;s
brand equity (as can happen in the case of price reductions). Consumer sales promotion encour-
ages new product sales, increase usage of existing products, helps sales of the entire range of products
and adds to selling efforts. Retail promotion helps in building inventories with the distribution
network and indirectly acts as a sales push in the market as no one can keep large inventories
for long.
<p>Depending on the product and trade practices, fi rms send dealers on trips to foreign countries
on achieving the targets. Some fi rms offer cars and other consumer goods as incentives to achieve
the sales as planned. Promotion programmes are known to increase sales and market share, which
lasts as long as the competition does not retaliate. Hence, it is wise to closely observe the competi-
tion&rsquo;s activities and to be proactive rather than react to losing situations.
<p>Ideally the sales graph for sales promotion should be as given in Figure 15.9.
As can be seen, the fi rm has gained quite a substantial amount of market share (additional sales AA)
<p>but do not forget that this is the ideal situation. The competition is always there to counter the fi rm&rsquo;s
moves and hence the need for continuity in promotion plans!
<p>As can be seen, sales promotion is a short-term plan to increase sales. It can be used for the following
reasons:
<p>1. Loss of sales due to production problems.
2. New product or variant launches.
3. To beat the competitor&rsquo;s plans.
4. Increase in production capacity.</p>
<br>
</div>

<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 383
<p>Generally, a combination approach is required, that of consumer promotion and dealers promo-
tion plan. However, if there is only consumer promotion it increases the sales and profi t of the dealer
too and hence the channel members welcome it.
<p>One major reason for the failure of promotion plans is the dishonesty of dealers, who do not give
the extra benefi t to the consumer and pocket it themselves. Many of us have purchased a cake of soap,
which was to be given as free gift with a bottle of shampoo, as written on the soap package. While
most dealers and retailers play the game honestly as they know that ultimately the advantage is going
to be theirs because of increased sales and profi ts, fi rms should be careful in selecting dealers and
retailers in the initial stage itself.
<p>A major area of channel/distribution network promotion is training of its personnel. Automobile
fi rms like Maruti and Daewoo send their dealer technicians to their respective headquarters in Japan or
Korea for training because they are aware that the only competitive advantage that can really sustain
and cannot be copied is the excellence of service provided to their customers. In the area of white
goods, some fi rms encourage dealers to keep a few trained servicemen to attend to minor complaints.
The failure rate or mean time between failures (MTBF) really defi nes the quality of a product and
differentiates it from other products in its range.
<p>Finally, fi rms can take their pick of the variety of sales promotion plans available or think of some
new innovative promotion techniques. However, they must always remain proactive to the market
needs, situations and environment changes.
<p>MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND ECONOMY
<p>A lot of laymen wonder about marketing and its subtleties in the macroeconomic state of the country.
Let us discuss a few cases on this issue to understand it a little better. The marketing plans discussed
next have been chosen as representative of different classes. These will provide an insight to the
readers into the world of marketing.
<p>1. Product launch&mdash;cellphones.
<p>Figure 15.9 Sales Graph Showing Changes in Sales due to Promotion</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>International Marketing Management384
<p>2. Maintain market share&mdash;Pepsi.
3. Create retail business&mdash;Nanz chain of retail stores.
4. Provide salespersons with business opportunities&mdash;FMCG products, Hindustan Unilever.
5. Public interest advertising&mdash;pollution control on Delhi roads.
<p>Product Launch
<p>A few years ago, Airtel introduced a then unknown product&mdash;cellphones to the Delhi public. There
were banners across several main roads announcing: &lsquo;there is something new in the air&mdash;Airtel&rsquo;. A
lot of speculation went on among the elite of the town and most persons were intrigued by the ad-
vertisement. Many thought it was a new TV channel. Others opined that it was a new airline. The
debate went on till it was resolved with the launch of Airtel cellphone service in Delhi. It became the
new status symbol for the people of Delhi. People in Delhi have always been status conscious due to
the composition of the population, which includes bureaucrats, industrialists, media personalities,
famous doctors, lawyers and diplomats. Later, when competition caught up with it, Airtel started
expanding its product range, refi ning the services provided and making attractive price packages to
stay ahead of its competitors.
<p>Airtel took the following points into account:
<p>1. Airtel provides tremendous opportunities to modern business. It makes communication possible
as and when the need arises. Pagers, the predecessors of mobiles, allowed for only one-way
communication and that too by means of text on a limited screen.
<p>2. A proven technology in Europe, the GSM, which ensured upgradation of technology as it was
happening any where in the world.
<p>3. Geographic coverage of large cities like Delhi and Mumbai. With roaming facility today you
can be anywhere in the world and use the same cellphone to communicate with your friends
and business associates around the world.
<p>4. Internet on cellphones, the facility to send and receive text messages and conferencing facilities
has made the cellphone a veritable boon to the business executive of today.
<p>Market Share
<p>Pepsi realised that unless it kept the product visibility on a permanent pedestal and kept the product on
the top of the mind recall, their severest competitor, Coke, would steal their share in no time. With this
realisation, the now famous Pepsi&ndash;Coke advertising war started. Both the fi rms leave no opportunity
to upstage the other. India is a land of celebrations round the year. Be it a religious festival or a social
one, people are out on the streets with unmatched gusto.
<p>Regional festivals like Ganpati Mahotsav in Maharashtra, Durga Pooja in Bengal, Pongal in the
south and Baisakhi in Punjab are times to celebrate and cold drinks are sure to be a part of the gala.
During such festivities TV viewers are virtually bombarded by the advertising campaigns of the cold
drink manufacturers.</p>

<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 385
<p>Create Retail Business
<p>Retail chains are taking over the retail business from individual retailers as with bulk buying they can
provide lower prices, have better merchandising, use marketing and retailing expertise and provide
real value for money to their customers. They face the following problems, which they try to answer
through their marketing campaigns:
<p>1. Small individual retailers are more aware of the needs, mindsets and buying behaviour and
patterns of the local customers.
<p>2. Home delivery and credit sale are better managed by small retailer.
3. With lower per product inventory, loss on account of a product not selling is less.
4. Faster inventory turnaround means better profi ts.
<p>Retail store chains have the following advantages:
<p>1. Uniformly good quality of products.
2. Large variety of products.
3. Multiple brands of the same product giving the buyer the right to choose.
4. Hygienic conditions in the sales rooms.
5. Play areas for children accompanying the buyers for ease in buying.
6. In-house restaurant to refresh the shoppers.
<p>Since retail stores are spread in different parts of a town, the chain uses local media like local
cinema, press, handbills and billboards to ensure the buyer&rsquo;s top of the mind recall.
<p>Providing Salespersons with Sales Opportunities
<p>Providing salespersons with sales opportunities is done through a variety of advertising campaigns.
The most effective ones are from FMCG fi rms. Retail traffi c increases for a new product in direct
proportion to its awareness and top of the mind recall. For example, if just a few buyers (say two or
three in a day) ask for a new brand, the salesman will sell them any reputed brand which is in stock,
instead. However, if 20 or 30 people ask for the product, the retailer will be forced to stock the product
else he will lose customers to competing stores. We can see advertising develops sales pull, as against
inventories, which provide sales push through inventory pressure.
<p>In the case of industrial product/business-to-business sales, advertising helps in making the buyer
know about the product and mainly pre-sell the products to the fi rm. In other words, it helps in image
building of the fi rm. In turn, the salespersons of the fi rm get an easy access to people in the purchase
department of the fi rm. It helps the salesman to get a foot in the door.
<p>Creating Social Awareness
<p>Advertising helps in building public awareness towards social issues. We have all seen advertise-
ments that propagate cleanliness, pollution control, small family norms and raise awareness about the </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management386
<p>ill effects of dowry and child marriages. Such advertisements help in building consciousness among
the public towards the cause and this in turn proves effective in eradicating the problem.
<p>Besides this, advertising, which is a marketing mix factor, helps in the following areas in the
economic sphere:
<p> 1. Advertising removes the pressures of governmental/political or business control of the media,
both print and electronic. In other words, since the media is not dependent fi nancially on the
government, political bigwigs and industrialists, it can be bold in its editorial content and
hence can play its rightful role as the watchdog of institutions like the bureaucracy, judiciary,
legislature and business.
<p> 2. Advertising helps build a fi ne-tuned management system, which delivers what it promises
through its advertisements. It helps in streamlining processes and procedures for both man-
agement and workers for optimising results.
<p> 3. Brand equity helps in improving product quality differentiating it from other similar products,
which in turn benefi ts the buyers who get the right product at the right price.
<p> 4. Advertising tends to reduce distribution costs in certain products, which are sold on their
brand name only, without any need for further salesmanship. Personal selling becomes a lot
easier as the buyer is already aware of the product and needs only to reinforce his positive
ideas about the product.
<p> 5. Advertising has emerged as a major source of information about the product, its price, avail-
ability and other terms of business associated with the product like leasing options and detailed
specifi cations.
<p> 6. Advertising helps in research and development (R&amp;D) efforts, as the fi rms are sure that with
the help of advertising they will be able to launch new products developed by their R&amp;D.
<p> 7. Building brand equity or improving a fi rm&rsquo;s image helps fi rms in pricing the products higher
than the competition, as buyers get a mental picture of the quality of the product, which once
established through usage of the product dictates repeat buys of the same product.
<p> 8. Advertising gives customers vital information for free which helps them in correct decision-
making most of the times.
<p> 9. Advertisement helps in creating entry barriers for new brands as most customers become
brand loyal and this leaves little place for a newcomer. However, this statement holds less
meaning as for certain products like FMCGs, brand shift is most common as can be seen from
the new brands introduced in the market. Hence, entry barrier theory is mostly a theory only
with not much relevance to reality.
<p>10. As far as prices are concerned, advertising help build sales, increases revenues and therefore
can, in fact, be instrumental in price reduction if the fi rm wants to do it. Since price cuts are
equated to product quality, fi rms remain apprehensive in taking this measure, as they might
just lose their market.
<p>11. Advertising works as a sentinel of public conscience too. With the advent of colour TV, adver-
tising is affecting the viewers much more than ever before. It can be a lot more persuasive now.
Buyers do have increasing choices, but the responsibility of proper and correct information
lies squarely with the advertisers.
<p>MARKETING AND SOCIETY
Marketing, it is alleged, makes people buy extra things, which they may never need. However, we can
logically see that people normally make a budget of how much they want to spend on any particular </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 387
<p>product. The purchase decision is taken after a lot of investigations regarding alternates available, their
quality, after-sales service and price and, depending on product&rsquo;s value to the buyer, the process be-
comes time consuming and cumbersome. However, advertising gives the buyers information, which
is verifi able and which helps in making purchase decisions. We can infer that advertising helps in
improving the product quality, buyer&rsquo;s value for money and, as a consequence, helps develop buyer&rsquo;s
tastes for products of a good standard.
<p>The marketing of Health care products and feminine hygiene products improve the general
awareness of buyers about health issues. Hence, the quality of such products, which may be vital to the
very well-being of human beings, is of paramount importance. Advertisements at a point are the only
things buyers see before they even think of buying the product. Therefore the relative importance of
advertisements emerges from its dynamic effect on, at times, a gullible public.
<p>On a different plane, products with bad advertising can take away even the good points of a prod-
uct. The quality of the advertisement often determines the product quality in the buyer&rsquo;s mind. Even
mediocre products like Texla TV survived the onslaught of international brands as they had as a policy
positioned their product in an upscale market. It still has some share in the market, while some of its
better-known contemporaries have bitten the dust.
<p>There are some products, which are banned from being advertised like liquor, cigarettes, contra-
band goods and drugs. At times there are lacunae in the law, which debars advertising in one particular
media although the product is allowed to be advertised in other media. Such imbalances create chaos
in the buyer&rsquo;s minds and there should be uniformity on an international level about this issue.
<p>Society is at times, inundated by advertising blitz, which become counterproductive. The readers
reject magazines full of advertising and little else. In the same way, if the same advertisement is aired
repeatedly on TV and radio, it loses its appeal and turns objectionable even if it is a good advertisement.
While becoming eyesores to viewers, such advertisements show the shallowness of the creative depth
of the agency concerned.
<p>Advertising agencies have often been accused of exploiting the female form to enhance advertis-
ing appeal. Whether the product is a car tyre, health food, a lathe machine or even a screwdriver, it
is considered useful to show a pretty girl who is in no remote way connected to the product in its ad-
vertisement. Despite protests from the socially conscious, such usage is on the increase. The motto seems
to be: give the viewers what they want to see. Censorship is conspicuous by its absence. Advertising
associations have been trying to set up a self-censorship body within the advertising network without
any real success. Now, the changing societal norms, its permissiveness are refl ected in advertisements.
The question therefore is what leads to the present situation, uncensored advertisements or a permissive
society. It is defi nitely the need of the day to look at the present advertising scene from this point of
view at the earliest.
<p>Advertising creates value systems as people buy advertised products, which establishes a particular
lifestyle for the users of the products. Such products are, at times, purchased only to become a member
of that particular elite set. This tendency is more visible among young people and the newly rich. On
the other hand, advertisements help buyers realise their lifestyle through the information provided
in the advertisements. A person living near the sea may want to buy a boat. Seeing the advertise-
ment of a speedboat he may go for it as it is the status symbol of the elite. Product positioning and
choice of media for the target market segment are all based on getting the right person to see or have
the opportunity to see the advertisement. Hence it can be surmised that advertisement plays a useful
role in moulding the upwardly-mobile population in the right groove.
<p>Society revolves around certain norms like what are the desirable tangible products for any set
of people. Going beyond the product list meant for their set (which remains unwritten) people get
tempted to buy things they can hardly afford. The element of materialism is born out of this desire.
It was once said that all good things in life are for free. Now in the twenty-fi rst century, drinking water is </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management388
<p>being purchased (mineral water), air conditioners are purchased to provide the cool air we breathe. Even
simple products like salt, sugar and fl our are branded to provide mental satisfaction about the qual-
ity of the product, which were hitherto being sold as generic products. Marketing has therefore pro-
vided the consumers with options but, according to anti-materialistic group, buy they must.
<p>Advertising, when it takes the role of puffery, becomes misleading and hence harmful to buyers.
Puffery means exaggerations about the benefi ts of the product, which give a wrong picture to the
buyers. The temptation to use superlatives to describe an ordinary product is possibly so overwhelming
that we see many advertisements using puffery to attract customers. It should be remembered that
such advertisements are like a bucket with a hole and they do not carry any water in them.
<p>When you meet really rich people, you fi nd that they are not given to materialism. Many affl u-
ent Indians can be seen wearing the traditional dhoti-kurta as often as they wear their jeans and
tee-shirts.
<p>Leisure-time activities like trekking, jogging, camping, mountain climbing and other outdoor
sports and health-improving products like health foods, diet products, personal gyms take up big
advertising space and it helps in furthering the awareness of such activities and products, rendering
valuable service to society.
<p>Advertising can now be redefi ned in 11A&rsquo;s as follows:
<p> 1. Advertising deals with providing correct information to the target market segment/s.
2. Availability of products is confi rmed.
3. Awareness of the product benefi ts is highlighted.
4. Assessment of product utility for the consumer.
5. Adherent of the product&mdash;it makes people loyal to a brand.
6. Attitude change&mdash;if the buyers have a negative attitude towards your product it can be moulded
<p>in your favour through advertising.
7. Acceptance of the product by the buyers is through usage and trial.
8. Affordability gives the value for money picture to the customers to justify high prices.
9. Accessibility&mdash;advertisements tell the buyers how and where they can buy the product.
10. Aesthetics help in bringing out the best creativity to attract attention to the product.
11. Adventure adds to the dynamics of advertising campaigns and calls for an innovative spirit
<p>in the creative team.
<p>Advertising lets the press remain free from outside controls, as it earns enough from advertisements.
It means an independent editorial policy can be maintained adding credibility to the press. It remains
a moot debatable point whether advertisements can control press with huge revenues available to
press through advertisements.
<p>Advertising makes consumers use more of the product. For example, Kodak says, &lsquo;Take more
pictures&rsquo;; the Hero Honda motorcycles advertisement says, &lsquo;Fill it, shut it, forget it&rsquo;; many soap com-
panies advertise offers of buy two get one free.
<p>Increasing business can also be done to make the customer aware of the different uses of a product.
Baking soda can be used to freshen refrigerators by removing odours from its contents. Advertising this
aspect improved the sales of baking soda to a large extent while it provided customers with a service
unheard of by them. Orange juice was used only as a breakfast drink. Advertising orange juice as a
product that could keep the consumer fresh all day long helped in increasing its sales considerably.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 389
<p>The third alternative for increasing sales is to add new customers for the product. An airline started
advertising in the 1950s and 1960s that if your employee is travelling by train you are losing pre-
cious time, which converted into money was a big loss to the fi rm. While the airlines may not fi nd the
approach very successful, small car sellers are asking motorcycle users to change to more comfort-
able and weatherproof small cars. It can be seen that such advertisements try to look like they are
providing a social service too.
<p>Advertising should help fi rms achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, bulk purchase, cost
effectiveness so that they can offer better benefi ts, bonuses to the employees who are part of society.
<p>THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN: HOW DOES IT WORK?
<p>In order to accurately assess the customer perception of the service provided by Airtel in Madhya
Pradesh, Airtel conducts constant information gathering exercises to not only ensure customers
acceptance of the service but also for reinforcing the effectiveness of their advertising campaign.
<p>With the virtual monopoly of the Maruti in the small car segment, Hyundai had a hard time trying
to focus the customer&rsquo;s attention on their Santro, which was also positioned in the small car segment.
They used the super star of the Indian screen, Shah Rukh Khan, to position their car in the right slot
which paid them dividends in the form of market share in excess of their own expectations. In fact,
they got a market share greater than Matiz (the small car from the Daewoo group), although, Daewoo
had a distinct advantage of a longer presence in India with their large car, Ceilo.
<p>Thums Up, the cola drink, faces challenge from both Coke and Pepsi. To gain market share they are
repositioning the product as an adult product taking into account that both Coke and Pepsi have been
targeting the youth market. In the Thums up advertisement, the other super star of Indian movies,
Salman Khan, asks the audience, &lsquo;are you ready for the growing up challenge&rsquo;.
<p>Life Insurance Corporation of India was never into big time advertising. It was only after the set-
ting up of a commission to look into the privatisation of the insurance sector that they started their
advertising campaign in a big way. They also upgraded their product, made it more user friendly
and improved their response time. All of these came about with big advertising splashes to keep the
customers informed and motivated to buy their products.
<p>The book will be discussing different types of advertising including consumer advertising, busi-
ness advertising, industrial advertising, trade advertising, professional advertising and social adver-
tising. Besides national-level advertising, the book also discusses international advertising as well.
<p>The marketing planning process can be put graphically as shown in Figure 15.10.
Around the world, advertising reaches millions of people in their homes, workplace and shops
<p>where they buy. Based on the product and the advertising budget, media selection takes place for optim-
ised results with the target segment. Today&rsquo;s marketing managers want to reach out to the customers
at places selected by the customers to facilitate sale of their product, rather purchase of the product by
the customers. Hence customer orientation of fi rms is complete and fi rms have to match up their efforts
in production, fi nance and human resources to reap the benefi ts of the customer-fi rst concept.
<p>Change, it is said, is the only constant in the world. Hence, even advertising is evolving all the time.
The advertising evolution is likely to become an advertising revolution in the wake of the internet
and e-commerce. The media blitz of the twenty-fi rst century has surpassed all imaginable concepts </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management390
<p>and so have the creativity standards. Technology has been at the helm of these changes as will be
described in the following chapters.
<p>Practice is what makes one perfect. A lot of local advertising goes on, including cooperative ad-
vertising, trade advertising, point of purchase advertising, business advertising and direct mail
advertising. They have low budgets and their needs are different including media selection. These
are, in effect, part of the entire exercise of advertising, but need special emphasis due to their spe-
cial nature.
<p>Advertising can be classifi ed as generic and specifi c. In generic advertising, effort is made to
generate business for the entire product range including all the brands, while specifi c advertising is
done to promote sales of a particular brand only.
<p>Examples of generic advertising are as follows:
<p>1. Advertisements prompting people to drink more milk.
2. Advertisements prompting people to eat more eggs.
3. Advertisements prompting people to buy diamonds to please their wives (sponsored by de
<p>Beers).
<p>In social cause advertising it could be:
<p>1. Exercise your right to vote.
2. Keep your city clean.
3. Plant one tree each year.
4. Each one, teach one.
5. Anti-dowry campaigns.
6. Get your vehicle checked for polluting emissions.
7. Do not change lanes while driving.
8. Pay your taxes in time and do not evade taxes.

<p>For specific products, advertising brings in business due to advertising pull. Attractive
advertisements lead to top of the mind recall which gets translated to sales.
<p>Advertising is a marketing function in a typical fi rm and relates to the other areas as shown in
Figure 15.11:
<p>Figure 15.11 The Functional Areas of a Company
<p>The major organisations concerned with advertising are shown in Figure 15.12:
<p>Figure 15.12 Organisations in the Advertising Ambit
<p>The government lays down laws concerning advertising. In most countries, advertisements con-
cerning liquor and drugs are banned. In its own right, the government is also an advertiser.
<p>The advertiser is the hub of all advertising activities as he is the one directly connected with the
results of the advertisement. Business fi rms have to advertise goods to improve their brand image,
which in turn helps them in increasing sales in a competitive situation. Public service organisations
also advertise to educate people about improving the quality of life for the citizens of the country.
The following 16 industries are the top advertisers in any country:
<p>1. Airlines
2. Appliances, TV and radio
3. Cars
4. Medicines
5. Food</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management392
<p> 6. Candy/chocolates
7. Colas
8. Toiletries
9. Tobacco
10. Dresses
11. White goods
12. Cellphones
13. Scooters and motorcycles
14. Films
15. Watches
16. Service industry, like hotels
<p>The government as an advertiser has not been counted in the list. They are big advertisers for
purchasing, selling and recruitments. Firms selling liquor, who are not allowed to advertise in most
countries, resort to using indirect methods like sponsoring sports events, advertising mineral water
belonging to the same brand.
<p>Research groups are constantly working on different market segments for a variety of products for
understanding consumer behaviour, lifestyle, mindsets and at times have readymade answers to ques-
tions posed by the advertisers in this regards. Their role is of providing assistance to the agencies.
<p>The role of different organisations which assist the advertisers can be seen in the block diagram
given in Figure 15.13:
<p>Figure 15.13 Advertising and Related Agencies
<p>As can be seen, the agency plays the role of a coordinator between the advertiser and the media.
Research agencies conduct continuous research for understanding the effectiveness of different
media as also the mindsets of the target market segment.
<p>Advertising has become an important discipline and plenty of literature is available on the differ-
ent aspects of advertising. There are books, magazines, reports and videos dealing with the subject,
some of them dating back to the turn of the twentieth century. Advertising has been seen from the
following viewpoints:
<p>1. Psychological
2. Social
3. Philosophical
4. Economics
5. Management</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 393
<p>The management perspective of marketing confi rms the supremacy of market share and brand
equity in every business. However, from the last decade of twentieth century, fi rms are becoming
more and more aware of their responsibilities towards their stakeholders. The fi rm survives because
of and for the stakeholders. The stakeholders of a fi rm are:
<p>1. Personnel&mdash;workers and management
2. Buyers
3. Suppliers
4. Financial institutions
5. Government
6. Trade bodies
7. Residents living in the neighbourhood of the company
8. Fauna and fl ora which can get affected by polluting industries
<p>In order to keep a balance between the interests of these groups, which at times can be confl icting
too, fi rms need to be transparent in all their dealings. This calls for an extensive spread of information
through advertising.
<p>Factors connected to advertising are shown in Figure 15.14:
<p>Figure 15.14 Advertising Factors
<p>Figure 15.14 is self-explanatory. Marketing plans are made keeping in view the social and legal
constraints, competition and agencies like advertising agency and distribution networks. From these
plans advertising plans emerge. After defi ning the objectives and budget, the creative team works to
produce the artwork, which, after the client&rsquo;s acceptance, goes to the media as per the agreed schedule.
The media is selected on the basis of the segment being catered to.
<p>In segmenting the market, focus can be kept on concentration of customers in a defi ned geographic
area or more than one group is selected and communication designed to suit the segments. At times
going to a smaller segment helps as no competitor may be catering to that segment. In large seg-
ments, competition is usually severe with price wars rendering it less attractive.
<p>Smaller segments are useful in product launches when the seller is not too sure of market reaction
to the product. Small fi rms, specialty product fi rms normally take the route of smaller segments.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management394
<p>Firms opting for large segments need to focus on each sub-segment for planning advertising cam-
paigns because the mindsets, language and motivation may differ signifi cantly for each sub-group.
Firms even plan different products to catch the fancy of separate sub-segment. Maruti has its 800 version
for the middle class segment while its Esteem covers the upper class segment. Maruti&rsquo;s segmenta-
tion goes beyond the middle class and upper class as they have the Gypsy, which caters to the
adventurous, and the Omni van, which can be used a as multiuse vehicle.
<p>For time-saving products, working women constitute a major segment of the consumers. A research
conducted on whether women should work in offi ce brought mixed responses as summarised in
Table 15.4.
<p>Table 15.4 Women at the Workplace
<p>Demographics Yes (%) No (%)

<p>Depending on the product you have to advertise to the target segment and the appropriate media
has to be chosen to reach the target audience. Please note that Table 15.4 is only a hypothetical example.
The most appropriate media is selected on the basis of market segmentation for a product. Market
research helps in the right segment selection.
<p>In India, the number of women in the workforce has been on the rise. Population shifts from rural
to urban areas is a major factor. Increasing population of teenage children and senior citizens is creat-
ing unparalleled business opportunities for some types of products.
<p>While mass media rules the advertising communication, to fi nd the most suitable communication
plan for a particular segment, segment de-massifi cation is being done. You pick up one or two repre-
sentatives of the segment and then fi nd out everything about that person for testing the communication
created for that segment. Once the segment is clearly defi ned the creative task begins.
<p>THE CREATIVE ART
<p>The creative artist has to know how the target audience will view and accept the art of the advertise-
ment. While talking to children, it is important to communicate with them in their mother tongue. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 395
<p>What really affects and stimulates the viewers must be clearly understood. How people acquire pre-
conceived notions about products, which also distorts images of even a well-conceived advertisement,
must be well know. This would prevent the wrong message from going to the market.
<p>Consumers need to know about their needs and the products that will best satisfy them in the most
cost-effective manner. Do the customers ask their friends, relatives or experts before making pur-
chase decision? How the mindset is formed and the psychology of the consumer has to be understood.
The advertiser has to take on the role of a psychologist to be able to give the right input and stimulus
for the purpose. The use of prominent persons as endorsers helps in this direction but you have to
choose the correct person for endorsing the product.
<p>To convert negative feelings for your product into positive ones needs an all round approach
consisting of endorsements by the right people, proper merchandising of the product and point of
purchase advertising.
<p>Next, the advertising creativity has to fi nd the actual benefi ts sought by the customers. Scanning
competitive products and their advertisements will give an insight into what signifi cant benefi ts have
been left out by the competition and this will help creative people to chart the proper route taking these
benefi ts into account. The best analysis of competition is done by learning about their 4Ps&mdash;product,
price, placement and promotion. Table 15.5 gives an idea of what needs to be done.
<p>Table 15.5 Analysis of a Company&rsquo;s Marketing Factors with Competitive Factors
<p>Attributes of your
product
<p>Benefi ts which the
customers will derive
<p>from the product
<p>Attributes

competitor
<p>Benefi ts of the
fi rst competitive
<p>product
<p>Attributes
of the second
competitor
<p>Benefi ts of the
second competitor&rsquo;s
<p>products
<p>Most advertising agencies use this method without sometimes making such a table. (As an ex-
ample, while the attribute of a shirt could be the use of silk, the benefi t, which the wearer would derive,
would be an expression of his lifestyle as also the smooth fl ow of the shirt on the wearer&rsquo;s body.)
<p>It must be remembered that the benefi ts derived as per the fi rm&rsquo;s own ideas may not be the same
as the customer&rsquo;s ideas. It is best to undertake advertising research to get the right picture to produce
result-oriented art.
<p>Analysis of the market for a particular product has to start from proper market segmentation, buyer&rsquo;s
profi le, competitive strengths and weaknesses. Population shifts, social-cultural changes, lifestyle
changes, and income distribution patterns help in understanding the market dynamics better.
<p>The task of market analysis becomes acute when the number of competitors is high and each one
of them has distinct advantages in some area or the other. Taking cars into account, we can draw such
a graph showing comfort and price as shown in Figure 15.15.
<p>Ideally, the advertising budget or expense on advertising should match or be a little less than the
extra profi ts the advertising generates. This is expressed as:
<p>S = f (A), where S is the sales fi gure and A is the advertising expense.
<p>This equation presumes that the only factor of sales is advertising, which as we know is not correct.
Going with the presumption made in this formula for the time being, gross margin of profi t minus
the advertising expense gives the net profi t:
<p>Net profi t = gross profi t &ndash; advertising expense</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management396
<p>In case the advertising expense increases beyond the gross margin, the fi rm runs into losses (see
Figure 15.16)
<p>Figure 15.16 Advertising Expense, Sales and Profi t Matrix
<p>The main disadvantage of this analysis is that it presumes that sales come only through advertis-
ing, while it is known that other factors like sales efforts, pricing promotion and after-sales service
play an important role in increasing sales.
<p>TRENDS AND INDICATIONS
<p>Let us discuss some macroeconomic indicators, which are only indicative (for correct fi gures the
students will do well to fi nd them out). India&rsquo;s GNP has increased from 1980 till today by about seven
times on current prices. Similarly, the per capita GNP has also increased by six times in the same
period. Similar information should be collected for other countries as well.

<p>Commercial advertising rates of the channels depend on the following factors:
<p>1. Geographic coverage of the channel.
2. Language used.
3. Types of programmes.
4. TRP ratings of the individual programmes.
5. Telecast time.
<p>As companies plan research on the effect of advertising it should be understood that people do not
concentrate and the answers you get may be not as accurate as you might take them to be. People get
varied perceptions about the advertisements as can be seen from the following statements:
<p>1. For a successful campaign the agency claims the total sales increase is due to their creative
effort.
<p>2. In case of failure of a retail campaign, the retailer feels that the misadventure of the marketing/
advertising department is thankfully over never to be tried again.
<p>3. In business-to-business marketing (industrial marketing), the sales team always takes the credit
and yet acknowledges the fact that the advertising campaign helped them in getting the door
opened.
<p>4. In elections, the defeated candidate will blame the marketing/advertising campaign and say
that it did not refl ect his true image.
<p>These may be partly true and in order to be impartial one has to assume that only when advertising
is playing a major role in the marketing and the other factors are either dormant or non-existent can
the evaluation be properly judged.
<p>The working plan for assessing the marketing/advertising effort can be worked out in the following
manner: Divide the market into two equal segments. As you start running your usual campaign, </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>International Marketing Management398
<p>continue it for a period say, two months. Next while you continue the campaign in both the segments
in one segment (only), start a spot advertising campaign (see Figures 15.17[a] and 15.17[b]).
<p>Figure 15.17(a) Effect of Advertising Campaigns on Sales
<p>Figure 15.17(b) Effect of Spot Campaigns on Sales
<p>On the horizontal line, the time period is divided as a and b. A is the regular advertising campaign,
B is the sale fi gure. In Figure 15.17(b) you see that after half period C, a spot campaign has been started
which has given rise to sales.
<p>Market sales before the TV spot campaign is Rs 600, 000. Sales during the spot campaign is
Rs 630,000.
<p>MEDIA SELECTION PLANS
<p>While doing media planning, the following questions need to be answered:
<p>1. Whom are we trying to reach?
2. Where are they located?
3. What is the best time for them to see the advertisements?
<p>To answer the fi rst question we have to know the exact market segment. Although everybody could
be a prospective buyer, some are more inclined to buy. Marketers segregate these people through
demographic, psychographics social class and lifestyle categories. It is believed that people in one
segment would behave in a similar manner and would have the same type of needs and preferences. </p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 399
<p>Rich people with trendy lifestyles will read magazines like Vogue and Cosmopolitan, while those not
in that class will not be reading these magazines. This helps in focusing on the segment directly inter-
ested in your product.
<p>In India 70 per cent of the population lives in villages. The balance 30 per cent lives in cities and
has a different mindset than that of the villagers. With several languages being spoken in the country,
there are several newspapers and magazines catering to each language group. These are the best
media to reach out to people of a particular linguistic group. Products used in towns can be advertised
in English as it is the language which most people understand.
<p>Television as a media has a wide reach today and telecasting is available in several languages.
If price is not a major deterrent then TV as a media is most effective.
<p>In order to fi nd the answer to the question &lsquo;what to advertise and when?&rsquo;, it is best to see creative
advertisements. If the advertisement is pictorial, full of exquisite colours, then glossy magazines are
the right print media. If a lot of demonstration needs to be shown, TV should be used.
<p>Magazines have their defi nite readership and each has its own particular fl avour. What will go
well in a magazine like India Today will look out of place in a movie magazine.
<p>Readership surveys of magazines tell us the following:
<p>1. Percentage of men and women readers.
2. Percentage of age group in each case. For example, what percentage of women readers in the
<p>age group of 25&ndash;34 read every issue of Femina?
3. Percentage of income groups reading a magazine. For example, what percentage of men in the
<p>income group of Rs 25,000 per month read every issue of India Today?
4. Percentage of education segment. For example, what percentage of graduates read every issue
<p>of Business India?
<p>In the same way, information is available with respect to marital status of the readers, number of
children they have, what religion they practice.

<p>Media Status
<p>NEWSPAPERS
<p>A good source for information, news, entertainment and local activities. The reading public constitutes
adults, mainly the elderly, better educated and better off people. It has wide market coverage.
<p>CONSUMER MAGAZINES
<p>Good for current social and cultural events, mostly local, glossy but quality not uniform in every
magazine. Reading public comprises sports people, cooks, housewives, hobbyists and investing public.
Circulation in large and medium-size towns.
<p>SPECIFIC MAGAZINES
<p>Good for special needs, like women magazines, fi lm-based, health, cooking, business, sports and
cultural/social magazines. They are for the trendy public and they increase their awareness of the
social and cultural environments.
<p>RADIO
<p>Radio is a media of the masses, it is highly varied in its content, from news to classical music to art and
fi lm music. The media covers the entire country and with FM it is becoming popular again amongst
the youth as it provides clear music of all varieties. Radio is especially popular in villages where colour
TV is not yet available. It can be used as a media for the masses and for the youth who listen to FM
radio. Radio does not provide international exposure in a way TV does with satellite channels.
<p>TELEVISION
<p>Television is the most visible media and its covering across the country is large; it covers even remote
villages. It has a great impact on people. Live demonstrations of products can be shown on TV. Viewers
include all segments, the whole family (the viewing time may differ for parents and children). The
advertising costs on TV are high. There is uncertainty about reaching the desired segment as many
people use the TV remote to view other channels when advertisements come on.
<p>OUTDOOR ADVERTISING
<p>This has high visibility in a limited way, for the people on the road. It distracts drivers and hence is
being banned by some states including Delhi. It gives brand awareness and broad product view.</p>
<br>
</div>
<div class="page">
<br>
<p>Advertising and Promotion in International Markets 401
<p>DIRECT MAIL
<p>It is selective and personal. It is becoming popular. The mailer controls the persons who will get to
read the mail but has no control on their responses.
<p>CABLE TV
<p>It uses the superimposing technique, which is mostly not acceptable to the channel owners. Low cost
and local advertising is possible. Viewers fi nd advertisements an irritant which appear when they
watch their favourite programme.
<p>YELLOW PAGES
<p>This is a mass media. It appeals largely to those who have access to phones. It has limited usage.
<p>NEW MEDIA ON THE CARDS
<p>In France, the phone company provides small computers, Minitel, to their subscribers, through which
they can contact banks, shops, travel services among others. Computers at home have software that
superimposes advertisements as you browse on the internet. You see the advertisements on the
bottom of the computer screen. In supermarkets, big screens show and the products on sale and
where they may be found. This is an extension of the POP advertisements, which have remained in
vogue for some time.
<p>Task for Students
In order to make the music albums popular, singers and others in the music world have started resorting
to showing music videos with vibrant motions/colours and actions which attracts the young mind.
Music videos are short fi lms that have specialised directors, actors, dancers and crew.
<p>&lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast; &lowast;
<p>Situation
<p>Music videos are good, entertaining advertisements. They advertise the music albums. Discuss if you
rate them as advertisements or as entertainment. If they are a bit of both, discuss their role as advertise-
ment. Do the music videos follow the telecasting norms of decency in India? Do you think that the
subtle advertising of music albums through music videos is side-tracking the real advertising time?</p>

<p>Solutions
<p>Divide the class into groups of fi ve people, who will form an advertising agency. Each group will
do the following:
<p>1. Give a name to their agency.
2. Allot portfolios among themselves as shown next:
<p> CEO
Account director
Creative director
Copywriter
Media planner
<p> Next, they jointly meet a fi rm and take a brief for planning its advertising for the next year.
(Select a fi rm where one member has easy access to the top brass. In case it is not possible, ask
your professor to give you a hypothetical fi rm&rsquo;s brief.)
<p>3. After getting the brief, fi nd out the target market segment. Most likely the client will give you
ample information on this subject.
<p>4. Next, the media planner should suggest the right media for reaching the target segment. This
is discussed and fi nalised after taking the clients approval.
<p>5. Keeping the media in view, the creative persons should work out an advertising layout. The
CEO and others then test the layout through advertising research in the market segment and
modify the layout if needed.
<p>6. Find out the current rates of media purchasing and fi nalise the budget. It should be in line with
the budget idea given by the client.
<p>7. Each team should prepare individual portfolios of such total advertising plans and keep it with
themselves. These will come handy when students go out for job interviews.
<p>As a corollary, fi nd out who are the members of other market segments who will be exposed to the
advertisement and discuss if a demand which cannot be met is being created by the advertisement.
If yes, is it ethical, especially for countries like India?
<p>Now add one more member to the team. He should play the role of the advertising manager of
the client&rsquo;s fi rm. Now, arrange a meeting of your team with the advertising manager and discuss the
campaign with him. (If possible conduct this with a real advertising manager.) Prepare for the meeting,
anticipate the questions he is going to ask and your answers to them. One member should be asked
to make minutes of the meeting.
<p>At the end of the meeting, please analyse the entire episode with the help of your professor and
locate the improvement opportunities in your presentation (see Figure 15.18).
<p>Once the team has been formed it can be used to do many such tasks. A well-made campaign is
in itself a reward for the students.
<p>Of course advertisers want accountability, but it must often be measured in a more modest and
intangible way than we would like. I am afraid that we will have to accept that much advertising
can repay fully over long periods of time and its payback is impossible to monitor with any degree
of precision.
<p>We fi nd that millions of rupees are spent on advertising everyday. Firms spend up to 30 per cent
of their profi t after tax on advertising. What is the method in the paradoxical situation? We will try
to analyse the same in this chapter.</p>
